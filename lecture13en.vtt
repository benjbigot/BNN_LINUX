the new the in this lecture we

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
begin a discussion of the topic modulation

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which is among other things a very important

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
topic in practical terms for example it

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
forms the cornerstone for many communication systems

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and also as we'll see as these lectures go along

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
a particular for modulation referred to as poss amplitude modulation and

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
eventually

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
impulse modulation or impose train modulation

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
forms a very important bridge between

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
continuous-time signals in discrete-time signals

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
now in general terms

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
what we mean when we refer to modulation is the notion

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
%uh using one signal to very

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
a parameter up another signal for example

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a sinusoidal signal has three parameters

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
amplitude frequency and phase and we could think for example

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
love using one signal

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to very let's say the airport to up a sinusoidal signal

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and what that leads to is an ocean which will develop in some detail

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
referred to as sinusoidal amplitude modulation

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and would correspond to a

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
sinusoidal signal refer to as the carrier

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and its amplitude being buried on the basis

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
love another signal now

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
alternatively we could think all burying either the

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
frequency or the phase a sinusoidal signal

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
again with another signal and with that leads to is another very important

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
notion

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
which is referred to as sinusoidal

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
frequency modulation where essentially

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it's the frequency up a sinusoid that's changing

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
depending on the signal that we're using

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to modulate this sinusoid now

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
sign a soil amplitude frequency and phase modulation

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
are extremely important topics and ideas

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
in the context ok communication systems what are the reasons is dead if you want

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to transmit a signal let's say for example a voice signal

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the voice signal that you're listening to now if you try to transmit that over

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
long distances because the frequencies involved

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the medium that you use to transmitted

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
won't carry it long distances the idea then

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is to essentially take that signal like a voice signal

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
use it to modulate a much higher frequency signal

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and then transmit that higher frequency signal

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
over a medium dead essentially can support

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
long-distance transmission at those frequencies then at the other end of

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
course

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the voice information or whatever else the information is

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is taken off now also

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
a notion that that leads to an will be developing in

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
some detail is kind of the idea that in fact

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you can simultaneously transmit more than one signal

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
by in essence taking several voice signals or other signals

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
using them to modulate either the frequency or amplitude

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
love sinusoidal signals at different frequencies

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ending all those together that's a process called multiplexing

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and then at the other end the transmission system

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
taking those sinusoidal signals apart and then

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
extracting the envelope or frequency modulation information

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to get back to the voice signal or other information carrying signal

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so that's one of the very important ways in which

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
modulation is used sinusoidal modulation is used in communication systems

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and and white will see as

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
in particular as we go through today's lecture

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
is there'd amplitude modulation sinusoidal amplitude modulation

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
in fact follows in a fairly straightforward way

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
from the properties of the four EA transform

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that we've developed in summer the earlier lectures

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so our focus on in today's lecture

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
will be on sinusoidal amplitude modulation

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
in continuous-time in the next lecture will

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
consider the same set of notions related to discrete-time

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and also a concept referred to as poss amplitude modulation

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and all of these follow very in a very straightforward way from the modulation

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
property for the 48 transform

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
issues of frequency and phase modulation are

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a little more difficult to analyze but in fact many have

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the techniques that we've developed in the previous lectures

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
also provide important insights into frequency phase modulation

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
summer this is develop in more detail

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
in the book so what I'd like to do

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is focus for now on the concept

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
love amplitude modulation

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and in as i indicated

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
there are several kinds love carrier signals

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
on which the modulation can be superimposed

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the basic structure for an amplitude modulation system

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
is one in which there is the modulating signal let's say for example Voice

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and a carrier signal what's referred to as the carrier

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and then of course the resulting output is the modulated output

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
now to analyze this since we have multiplication in the time domain

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we know from the property the 48 transform

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that we've developed previously the modulation property

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
dead multiplication in the time domain corresponds to

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
convolution in the frequency domain and it's this basic property or equation

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
dead lets us analyzed in some detail in fact

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the notions of amplitude modulation

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
as we go through this lecture and the next lecture

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we'll be talking as i indicated about several different types

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
carrier signals one is

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
what's referred to as poss carriers and that leads to

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
among other things the concept the pulse amplitude modulation

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that will be deferred until the next lecture

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in today's lecture what I'll focus on is

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
first the case of a complex exponential carrier

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
second the case of a sinusoidal carrier

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and in fact in the complex exponential carrier a sinusoidal carrier

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
are obviously very closely related since

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the complex exponential carrier is in effect

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to sinusoidal carriers one

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
for the real part and one for the imaginary part

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
so let's first begin a discussion love

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
amplitude modulation by considering a complex exponential carrier

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and then moving on to a discussion of a sinusoidal carrier

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
so the issue then is dead

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
we have a signal

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
x50 it's multiplied by a carrier

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and the carrier they were considering is a carrier signal

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
see if the of the form

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
e2 the J Omega CT

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
plus status see thats the form

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
love our carrier signal and

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
what we can first analyze is what

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the result things signal or spectrum is

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
at the output the modulator well we can do that by

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
concentrating on the modulation property

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and let's consider just are as a

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
serb general for respect from what i've indicated here

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
for the 48 transform love

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the input signal

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
or modulating signal exe phone maker and so

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
this is intended to represent

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the spectrum affect safety

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
has a $4 EA transform which is

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
an impulse in the frequency domain

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and the airport to up the impulse is

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
to partay to the J status subsea

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
where we noticed that the complex amplitude incorporates

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the phase information so

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
now if we multiply in the time domain week involving the frequency domain and

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
as you know

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
involving a signal with an impulse just shifts that signal to the location of

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the impulse

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and so as a consequence and taken care various

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
factors what we end up with is spectrum

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
then that is centered at the carrier frequency

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Omega subsea so

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
what this says is dead if we have a signal

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
x50 and we

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
use it to modulate a complex exponential carrier

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
in the frequency domain what we've simply done is to take

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the original spectrum and shifted in frequency

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to so that was originally at zero frequency is now centered around the

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
carrier frequency

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
now we've now modulated in effect to a higher frequency

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
things are happening at a higher frequency band and

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the next question is how do we do much away or in other words

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
how do we get the original signal back

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
well of course one way that we can think of doing it

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
particularly in the context love this

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
specific carrier if we look back at the top equation

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
we have as the result in the modulation

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
X 50 time see if he were see if t is this

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and we could consider for example

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
just simply dividing the modulator output by this

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
or equivalently taking the modulated output

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and multiplying by the to the

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
minus J Omega CT plus they to see

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
well let's track that through in terms of the spectra

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
we have again the spectrum or

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the output the modulator which is the original spectrum shifted

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
up to the carrier frequency we have

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
below that the spectrum love

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
e2 the minus J Omega CT plus they to see

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and if we now convolved this with this

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that results in simply shifting this spectrum except for

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
an issue the scale factor shifting this spectrum

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
back down to the origin so can bombing these two together

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the spectrum that we end up with is that

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
so weekend track this through in the frequency domain

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
in the frequency domain that says ship the spectrum up

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
when you want the modulate ship the spectrum back down

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and alternatively we can look at algebraically

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in the time domain what it says is if you multiply it by either the plush

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
chair make a CT

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
then when you want to get back multiply by in the minus chair make a CT

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
now one question that I you could conceivably be asking is

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
if we're talking about practical systems and not

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
simply mathematics in fact

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
doesn't make sense in the real world to consider

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
using a complex exponential carrier

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and the answer to that in fact is

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
yes dead very often in practical systems one considers

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
using a carrier which in fact is a complex exponential

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
well a complex exponentials complex there's a

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
square root of -1 in the air and you can kinda basse-bolle how do we get a square

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
root of -1

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and the answer is fairly simple let's

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
look again at the modulator which we have here

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and in effect with that says is we want to multiply

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
a real-valued signal by you the chair make a CT plus they to see

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
now we can equivalent Lee use oil as relationship

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to break this down into a cosine and sine term

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and so what that means interns have an implementation equivalent Lee

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is modulating x50

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
onto a cosine carrier

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and that then gives us the real part

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ald the complex output and modulating it onto

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
a sinusoidal carrier these two being ninety degrees out of phase

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and that gives us the imaginary part

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and so in effect this is the complex signal

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if we just simply think both hanging attack on here that says square root of

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
-1 RJ

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and we appropriately combined complex signals

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
following the rules of complex arithmetic and indeed that's exactly the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
way things are done in the real world

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
a complex signal is simply a set love

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to real signals and of course if we look at the spectra

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
involved if we we have here the real part and the imaginary part pov

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the complex output if we

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
again refer back to the original spectrum accessible maker

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and the modulated spectrum

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
which I show down here the original spectrum

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
shifted up to the carrier frequency

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in effect we're building nests I dove two lines

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
one-line representing the real part

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
love that and the real part in the time domain corresponds to the even part in

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the frequency domain

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and so with the output of one of the

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Cosi if the cosine modulator we have a spectrum

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that looks like this and

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the output love the along the imaginary branch

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
has a spectrum that looks like this

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
recalling the top branch that this

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
for positive frequencies is positive and was positive here and so in effect when

00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you add them

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
this portion of the spectrum will cancel out

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
so in effect what we're doing is building

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
then the complex signal

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in effect outta to real signals or we're building this complex

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
the spectrum the complex signal I dove separate lines the represent the

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
even and the art parts

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
okay now their

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
are lots of applications love amplitude modulation

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and we'll be seeing a number of these as we go through the discussion

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
what I'd like to do in is just indicate briefly

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
one now which is an application that

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
are in fact surface is fairly often in the context

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
love a complex exponential carrier

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and bad is the notion love using modulation

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to permit

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the application %uh love

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
a very well designed and implemented low-pass filter

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to be used as a bandpass filter and in fact as a set a bandpass filters

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
account here's the idea the idea is

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
if we have a fixed filter

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
work we have let's say we have a signal and we want to thank

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
all a filter which we want to kinda move along the signal

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
one way to do it is to somehow have filters the move along the signal

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the other possibility is to keep the filter fix and let

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the signal move in frequency in front of the filter

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
let me that may be a little more specific

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
suppose that we have a signal accept T

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and in we modulated with a complex exponential carrier

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
with the carrier frequency Omega see

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and the output if that is then processed with a low pass filter

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and then we d modulate the result

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
then in fact what we've done is to take the spectrum

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
or the input signal

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
shifted pullout what is now around low frequencies

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and then shift that part of the spectrum back to where it belongs

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
so if we look at that interns

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
over actually tracking through the spectra we would have

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
initially a spectrum for the original signal

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
which I show at the top as excessive Omega

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
after modulating or shifting that spectrum

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
up to a center frequency Omega see

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
we then have what I indicate here and the dotted line corresponds to

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the passband the low-caste filter

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
well the results have low pass filtering rejects

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
all the spectrum except the part around low frequencies

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and the next step is then 2d modulate

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
this and so in effect the modulating

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
will shift this spectrum back to where it originally came from

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and so that result will be what I

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
show in the final result

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
which is here and what we can say is that

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
this in fact is equivalent

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
if we can look back at the top spectrum

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
this is equivalent to having extracted

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
with a bandpass filter a section out of this part of the spectrum

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so interns love tracking through the spectrum and looking at

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the equivalent filtering operation

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
then what we accomplished was

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
to pull out this part of the spectrum

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
using a low-pass filter and modulation

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
but acquittal atlee what we implemented was

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
a bandpass filter as i indicate here

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
now of course a signal with this spectrum since

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
this spectrum is not kind you get symmetric we know that this signal does

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
not correspond to a real-valued signal

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
a quite lovely this filter doesn't correspond to a filter whose impulse

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
response Israel

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
if in fact we add another step to this

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
which is to take the real part of the output

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
then by taking the real part of the output we would be taking the

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
even part of the spectrum associated with that complex signal

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and the acquittal with author that we would end up with then

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
is the filter that I indicated the bottom

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
which is a bandpass filter

00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
now just two reiterate a point that I made earlier

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
a question of course is why would you go to this trouble why not just build a

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
bandpass filter

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and one other reasons is that

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
its often much easier to build

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
affixed filter a filter with a fixed center frequency for example a low-pass

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
filter

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
than it is to build the filter that has variable compliments in it so that

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
when you bury them the filters center frequency shifts around

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
now if you want to look at at the energy and a signaling different frequency

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
bands

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
then you'd like to look at it through different filters

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and so kind of the idea here which is really the basis for many spectrum

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
analyzers

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
is to build a really good quality low-pass filter

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and then use modulation which is often easier to implement use modulation

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
to shift the signal essentially in front of the wind

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
in front of the filter

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
okay well so we've can work their way through

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
modulation with a complex exponential carrier

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and what we saw

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
among other things with a complex exponential carrier

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
is that in fact what a car sponse to

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
is to

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
branches one being modulation

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
with a cosine and the other modulation with the sign

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and so in fact in the real world weren't there in a practical system

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
modulation the complex exponential carrier really would be accomplished

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
with modulation with the sinusoidal carrier

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and in particular with sinusoidal carriers

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that are in quadrature as its referred to or

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
covertly ninety degrees out of phase

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
okay well you in fact

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
sinusoidal modulation in other words modulation using only a sinusoidal

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
carrier

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
very often is used in its own right

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
not only for for generating a complex exponential carrier

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but in fact as a carrier by itself

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
well let's looking at what the consequences

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
love modulation with a sinus or to carry or R and a particular

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
work through again what the specter are

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and how we get the original signal back again

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
soul in we are talking then about a carrier signal

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
which is simply a sinusoidal signal

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
with some phase and of course we can

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
right that as the some love too complex exponential

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
signals and so in effect now

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
when we apply the modulation property we have the original spectrum

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
which a show here accessible maker

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and that's convolved with the spectrum love the carrier

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and the spectrum of the carrier in this case

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
is two impulses one at

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
plus Omega see and one at minus Omega see

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and the amplitudes if these incorporate the phase

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and later on in the lectured and

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and to and subsequent lectures all

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
have a tendency to drop that they deserve see just

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
to keep the notation an algebra little cleaner but

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
for now I've incorporated and so now

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
when we apply the modulation property what

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
we will do is convolved this spectrum

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
with this spectrum and the result of course

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is that the spectrum of the original signal

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
gets replicated at both Omega since the

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and at minus Omega subsea and

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the resulting spectrum at the output to the modulator then

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
is the spectrum that I show here

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
okay well now the question of course is

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
see now what's happened is there with a sinus or carrier we've moved

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the spectrum to both plus i'll make a CD and minus Omega see

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and now if we want to get the original signal back again

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
well we would like to do somehow is move that spectrum back down

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
to the origin now in the case for complex exponential

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that was easy to do which shifted one of which is shifted back down

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
let's see what happens if in fact we attempt 2d modulate

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
by again multiplying by the same sinusoidal carrier

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so let's examine what happens if

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
we now take

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
are modulated signal

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and again modulated

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
onto the same sinusoidal carrier

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
to generate the output WT if we look at the spectra

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we have then the

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
modulated spectrum which we had initially

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and we now want to convey all that again with the spectrum

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
or the carrier signal the specter the carrier signal

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I indicate here and if you tracked through the convolution which is fairly

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
straightforward

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
then in fact what happens as you can follow this with this

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is you end up with

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
a composite spectrum which

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
is what i've indicated on the bottom curve and has

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
in effect the spectrum of the original single exit see

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
replicated in three places one

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
is at -2 Omega subsea

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
one is around the origin and wanna shifted up to

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
twice the carrier frequency well

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
it's this piece that we want if we could eliminate everything else

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and keep this then that would in fact correspond to the spectrum

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
love the signal dead the original signal exit T

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
how do we do that well we know how

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to eliminate part of the spectrum and keep another part of the spectrum that's

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
called filtering so in fact what we would do

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
is put the result if this

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
through a low-pass filter low-pass filter route would retain the part of

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
the spectrum

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
around DC and eliminate the

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
remaining part of the spectrum so we would keep this part

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and eliminate the part of the spectrum that we have over here

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and let me just draw your attention to the fact that because of the way the

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
algebra works out

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
the amplitude love this replication the spectrum is half with the original

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
spectrum was and that means dead

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
ideally to keep scale factors correct we would choose the amplitude this

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
to be to to scale this

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
backup 21 okay so

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
what we have is the modulator and demodulator

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and just to summarize

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
for the case Ave sinusoidal

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
carrier as opposed to a complex exponential carrier

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the modulator is just as it is in the complex exponential case

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
its multiplication with the sinusoidal carrier

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
with frequency Omega see if a status

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
see in the d modulator

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
in the D modulator we would take the modulated signal

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
modulated again with the same carrier signal and as we'll see later

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
it's important to keep the same face relationship

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
this result is now not yet quite

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
that the modulated signal we need to process that

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
with a low-pass filter that extracts the part of the spectrum

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
around DC and throws away the upper part of the spectrum the case generated in

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the second modulation process and the resulting output

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
is the original signal

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
accept T right now

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
what we've done is we've taken X 50 we've

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
modulated it onto a carrier and then we've taken a modulated signal and we

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
figured out how to get back except Ian of course

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
one Caswell if you start with exiting you want to get X thirty back again

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
white by the going through all that why not just use exit see the beginning at

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the end and obviously

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
their are lots of reasons as i indicated before

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and just two reiterate what they are

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
the notion of an is that what you'd like to do

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
is shift the signal into a different frequency band

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
for transmission over some medium day

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
is more match to that frequency band

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
then the frequency range the original signal also

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
as I alluded to there's the notion that you can take lotsa signals

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and transmit them simultaneously over one

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
channel whether the channels a wire a mic wave like a satellite link or

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
whatever

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
again using the idea of modulation

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and what that process is referred to

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
as is multiplexing and let me just quickly indicate what

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that multiplexing process corresponds to

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
we could think for example love taking

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the taking one signal

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and modulating it on to one carrier

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
with one carrier frequency taking

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
a second signal modulating it onto a different carrier frequency

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
taking a third signal and modulating it

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
onto a third carrier frequency et cetera

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and if we choose these carrier frequencies

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
appropriately then in fact weekend and all those together

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and do it in such a way that the specter don't overlap

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
an end up with one broader band signal

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that incorporates the information

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
simultaneously in all of those

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
signals so just to illustrate that in the frequency domain

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
what we have let's say RR three spectra xaxa

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the Annex E and we would for example take

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
this spectrum and modulated

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
to a carrier frequency Omega sed est

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
we can take this spectrum and modulate it to a carrier frequency Omega sabi

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
where Omega sabi is chosen so that

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
when we and these two together they don't overlap

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
so that they can eventually be separated out and then of course we can do the

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
same thing

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
with the third signal and put that in a frequency range over here

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
be careful that none of those overlap

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and lonely and all those together the composite spectrum

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
is what I show here and

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
as you can see essentially

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
by doing appropriate bandpass filtering

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
we can pull at whatever part of the spectrum we choose to

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and then d modulate that in the appropriate way

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
of course we can do this not just with three signals but perhaps with

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
tens or hundreds of signals so that's a process

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
dead is typically referred to as multiplexing and as i've described here

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it's referred to as frequency division multiplexing

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that is dividing the frequency band into cells and plucking

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
different signals into each one of those

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and in so if we want now to recover one of those channels

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
in a frequency division multiplexing system

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
as i indicated we would first d multiplex

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the multiplexing corresponding to pulling out

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the appropriate channel with a bandpass filter

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and after D multiplexing we would then

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
d modulate and we would be modulated

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
with the carrier appropriate to the channel that we've pulled out

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and the the modulation of course

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
involves multiplying by the carrier and doing appropriate

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
low-pass filtering to finally get the signal back

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and frequency division multiplexing

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is one of those things that is

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
are its it's a fact which uses the typeof multiplexing issues for example

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in typical broadcast a.m.

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
radio systems where all the channels are superimposed

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
together and it's your home radio receiver that does the appropriate the

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
multiplexing in the modulating

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and of course you can see that not only is modulation an important part

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
of that but as I alluded to in the last lecture filtering

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
also becomes an important part love these practical systems

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
okay now the kinda amplitude modulation

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that i've talked about so far

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is what's referred to as

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
synchronous modulation and

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the reason for the term synchronous is dead in fact

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
what's implied in the system's

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is a synchronization between

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the transmitter and receiver in particular

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
in the system as we've talked about it

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the modulator

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and the D modulator

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
have a synchronization in

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
both frequency and phase the face here is indicated status if C

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and if we take a look at the D modulator

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
the the modulator has a

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
phase love status subsea

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and in general

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
there's the issue love whether we cannot maintain that synchronization between

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the modulator and demodulator

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and so what we want to examine now

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
more generally is what the consequences might be

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and the solution to the resulting problems

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
if in fact we don't have synchronization

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
between the modulator and demodulator

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
synchronization in terms of phase and

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
they're also by the way is another problem which is the issue

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
synchronization

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
in frequency thats examine more in

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
the text and one of focus on here is just the issue synchronization it face

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to give you some sense of

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
what the issue is okay well

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
so now what we want to look at is what happens if we have a modulator

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
with face status at sea

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and it D modulator where the phase instead if a is

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
said being status if C is some other phase

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the subsea and if you tracked through the details and the algebra

00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
then what you'll find is dead in fact the output love the low-pass filter

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
rather than being XFT the signal that we want

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
is X if T multiplied by a scale factor

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and the scale factor is the cosigner the phase difference

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
now one can ask okay well what's the big deal about

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
a scale factor if it's too small will make it bigger purse to be will make it

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
small

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
but there's several points 1 is notice for example that if the phase difference

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
between

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
much later and the modulator is 90 degrees

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
then in fact the output at the modulator

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
or if it isn't quite ninety degrees the amplitude might be small

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and the implication would be a that if there's other noise that gets injected

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in the system

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the signal to noise ratio is very low now even worse

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
is the issue that if

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
in fact there's a phase difference but the exact phase differences and

00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
maintained

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
so that the modulator and demodulator kinda fade in and out of phase

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
then in fact the output at the modulator

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
is x50 multiplied

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
by a time-varying fading term which is the cosigner the phase difference

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
well what that means essentially is dead

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
if you use this kind of system to do that the modulation

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
then in fact what you need to be careful about is

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
maintaining synchronization in phase and also is it turns out a frequency between

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
the modulator and demodulator

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
now there are alternatives to this

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and the alternative is what's referred to as

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
a synchronous the modulation and

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
let me indicate what the idea behind a synchronous

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the modulation is

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
now recall the what we've done in amplitude modulation

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is to take the carrier signal and very its ample to

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
with the signal that eventually we want to get back

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
so if we look at the amplitude modulated waveform it might

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
typically look as i indicated here

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and what we're trying to get back is we're trying to get back

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the envelope well one could imagine

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
building a circuit or designing a device which in some sense will

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
tracked the envelope and in fact a

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
common circuit to do that is a fairly simple

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
circuit consisting love a diode

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and a resistor and capacitor in parallel

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
kinda the idea being that the capacitor charges up

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
as this way for moves up to its p

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and then as the way for drops down the capacitor discharges through the

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
resistor and

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
it kinda tracks the envelope in fact the kinda output

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that we would get is the type of behavior that

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
i've indicated here and in fact than that is

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
a type all the modulation it

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
it's the modulation that doesn't require synchronization between

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the modulator and demodulator and

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it's fairly inexpensive to build

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
but it has obviously some

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
trade-offs associated with it well

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
to can indicate where the trade-off comes from or where the issue surfaces

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
notice the what we're doing is tracking

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
the envelope with the sinusoidal signal

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and we're calling mad or we're suing the back is our regional

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
signal exit T

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
well suppose that XFT

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the original signal is sometimes positive and sometimes negative

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
what might we see as we look

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
at the output out the modulator well the output at the modulator would've course

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
follow the envelope down and

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
then it would follow the envelope back up again

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
in other words what would tend to generate is

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
a full-wave rectified version all the signal that you were really trying to

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
get back

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
now there's a simple solution to this the simple solution

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
is to make sure that the signal

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that is the modulating signal XFT

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
never goes negative so if it happens to

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
voice signal happens tends to go negative that happens to

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
we can simply at a constant to it and and a

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
watchin of constant so that it always stays positive

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
well let's look at that in the

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
what we want to do then if we're considering a synchronous the modulation

00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
is to take our original signal x50

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and and to it a constant

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
where the constant is made large enough so they were sure

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
that this is a positive signal

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and it's a really let me just draw your attention to the fact that I'm now

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
suppressing

00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
the phase on the carrier signal since

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the phase is not important to the argument and it's just some additional

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
notation to carry around

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
now so the the idea then is an a constant exit see

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
notice that if we just take this term and expanded out into two terms

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
accept a cosigner Omega CT plus eight times cosine Omega CT

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
then in block diagram terms we can we can represent that as i've shown here

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and so it would correspond to modulating the signal

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
accept T onto the carrier Omega some CT

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and also injecting some carrier

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
with an amplitude a and the output at the modulator is then the summer those

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
two

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and the tech depending on exactly what this value a is

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
will influence what the envelope a look like

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and I indicate below to possibilities

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
one is where I'd made a fairly large

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and one is where I've made a significantly smaller

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and their are both positive and negative issues associated with whether a is too

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
large a raise too small

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
for example if a is small

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
in relation to the amplitude

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
love the signal then %uh rather pay is large in relation to the airport to the

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
signal

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
then this envelope tends to be very flat and it tends to be easy to track it with

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that simple diode RC circuit

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
as compared with the case down here

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
on the other hand their is a price that you pay

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
for this kind event below and the price that you pay is perhaps best seen in the

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
frequency domain

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
if we look in the frequency domain here

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
is our original spectrum

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
here is the spectrum at the output

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
%uh the modulator and the impulse that occurs here

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
corresponds to the carrier this injected

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
the larger a is the more carrier is injected

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the more carrier thats injected

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
the easier it is for the envelope detector

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
2d modulate so

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
one can ask well why not just put a lot in well

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the obvious answer is dead

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
it's not and information carrying part but the signal

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and so in some sense it represents inefficiency in transmission because

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
what you're transmitting is power energy

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
that doesn't have any information associated with it is simply the

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
injection of a carrier

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
to make d modulation for a

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
an AC Christie modulator the modulator to make

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
the the modulation easier

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and so there's this trade off and in fact one

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
kinda represents the trade-off and the Pratt Associated primers very often

00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
returns a percent modulation

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
where the percent modulation is

00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
a the essentially the ratio the maximum signal level

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
to the amplitude love the injected carrier

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and depending on whether

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the modulations very high or very low the trade-off

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
is dead the transmission is more efficient and it takes more energy but

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
the modulator is simpler

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
or the modulators more complicated but

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
the transmission is simply now there are situations where you might very well

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
want to use one or the other for example

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
in home radio your

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
of unwilling to transmit a lot of power

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
so that you can have inexpensive consumer-oriented receivers

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
on the other hand in satellite communication you willing

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
to pay a very high price for the modulators and D modulators

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
but its the amount of power that's transmitted

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
that's at a premium and so in one case satellite communication you use

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
synchronous modulation and demodulation where isn't typical consumer-oriented

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
broadcasting

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
you would use a sink in a synchronous system and

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Jenna and transmit more power even

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
transfer more power even if it's inefficient so that the D modulator

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
can be simply now

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
in a synchronous system then as we've indicated there's one source of

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
inefficiency which

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
is this injection at the Carrier there also

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
is a somewhat different issue

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
related to inefficiency in sinusoidal amplitude modulation

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and its inefficiency that is

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
separate from the issue synchronous first is a synchronous systems in other

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
words it's not associated with

00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
the injection of the carrier its a very different issue

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
let me indicate what that is let's look again

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
in at the spectrum love

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
X 50 which i've indicated here

00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and in a sinusoidal amplitude modulation system

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
we would shift this to

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
are centered around plus and minus the carrier frequency

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
now notice there in the original system we

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
occupier frequency spectrum thats two times Omega Savannah M

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
by the time we've shifted it we've used up

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
thinking a positive and negative frequencies we've used up

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
twice as much all the frequency spectrum

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
well you could say okay let's let's just shift this up this way and

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
get rid of this part that's of course what the complex exponential carrier did

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and the issue there really is that now you've got to transmit both the real

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
part an imaginary part

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
so what you can think about and ask is

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
if you still want to transmit a real-valued signal

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
happen you somehow remove the inefficiency or redundancy in the

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
spectrum

00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
well notice that what we have is

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
this spectrum moved here and moved here

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
and we could imagine building a

00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
real-valued signal by

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
eliminating what I refer to here as the lower sideband

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I have the positive frequencies and the lower sideband

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
otto's the negative frequencies

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and in effect what we've done is taken

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
just the positive frequencies here shifted them there

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the negative frequencies here and shifted them here and the resulting

00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,000
spectrum

00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
is what I indicate below

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
well this in fact is what is often done

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and what is referred to as is single sideband

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
what we've done is we've kept the upper sideband

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
in this particular case we could alternatively by the way

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
think love putting this system together

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
where we retain the lower

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
sideband instead of the upper sideband

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and in either case well we removed is

00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and inefficiency in transmission at the signal

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
namely we have a real value signal but it only requires as much

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
total band with the terms thereof the frequencies that I

00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that in which there's energy president as

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
the original sick well how do we do this there are a variety of ways

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
in and there's one procedure that is

00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
discussed in more detail in the text which uses was referred to as a

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
90-degree face splitter

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
the simplest way at least conceptually is to think about doing it with

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
filtering and the idea simply

00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
is dead if we have are modulated signal

00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
here's the spektr on the modulated signal and if that modulated signal is

00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
simply put through

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
a high pass filter than the result

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
will be to eliminate

00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
the lower sideband if we choose the high-pass filter

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
to have a characteristic as I indicate here

00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
so this course conceptually is a very sharp cutoff filter

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and what it eliminates are the lower side bands and the resulting spectrum

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
is what we have below

00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and this in fact is really kind of the basic idea

00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
behind single sideband transmission

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
again there's a trade-off it's clearly more efficient

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
then double sideband transmission

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
but also has the complication

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
or additional issue dead the modulator becomes a little more complicated

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
because you need

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this filtering operation or some equivalent operation to get rid of the

00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
unwanted side

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
okay well this is a fairly quick

00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
tour through a variety of issues related to modulation

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and it really is just the tip of the iceberg obviously

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
modulation in the context so sinusoidal

00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
modulation as we talked about has

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
in fact the lotto detailed issues associated with it

00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
it's important to recognize day at

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and to be somewhat pleased by the fact dead

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
not only with the mathematical foundations that we've developed

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
can we understand the basics of sinusoidal amplitude modulation but in

00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
fact

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
what you'll find issue if you

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
dig into this somewhat deeper that the basic background that we've built up so

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
far

00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
the mathematical tools are really

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
pretty much what you need for a much deeper understanding

00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
love all the issues involved

00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
so from a what might have seemed like a fairly abstract mathematical property

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
associated with the Fourier transform we've begun

00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
to develop what should give you the sense that some

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
important practical considerations

00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and as we'll see in the next lecture

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
very much the same kinds of notions apply a

00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
for discrete-time sinus oil on complex exponential

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
amplitude modulation and also as i indicated at the beginning at the

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
lecture

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
in the next lecture will also talk about what's referred to as possible to

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
modulation it's a different kind of carrier

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and what that will lead to among other things

00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
is a very important bridge

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
between the notions of continuous-time

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and the notions of discrete-time thank you
