00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
in the last lecture we begin

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the discussion love modulation and in particular what we focused on

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
was the continuous-time case and in talking about continuous-time modulation

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we covered a number of topics we talked about

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the properties and analysis love

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
modulation when we had a complex exponential

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
carrier signal we talked about the properties and analysis in the case of a

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
sinusoidal carrier

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and in that context and related to

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the application associated with communications

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we talked about synchronous modulation

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
a synchronous modulation and

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
also the notion love single sideband

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
modulation in

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the lecture today there are to issues that I'd like to address broad topics

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
one is Acer parallel discussion

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
particularly is associated with complex exponential sinusoidal modulation

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
for discrete-time signals and

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the second is the introduction and analysis

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
love a another kind of carriers specifically a post kind of carrier

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
in continuous time leading to the notions of pulse amplitude modulation

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and eventually a very powerful theramin result called the sampling there

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
well let me begin the lecture though focusing on

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the discrete-time modulation to essentially

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
draw your attention to the fact dead the analysis and discrete-time

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
very much parallels the analysis in continuous-time

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
well let's consider in the discrete-time

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
case just as we had in continuous-time a

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
signal modulating a carrier signal

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and the resulting modulated signal

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is why event and it was

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
in continuous-time the modulation property

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Associated with the four EA transform dead

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
provided the basis for the analysis and exactly the same thing is true in a

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
discrete-time

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
case in particular what we have in discrete-time

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is the modulation property as it relates to the Fourier transform

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
which tells us that the four EA transform of the modulated signal

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
is the convolution all the

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
for a transformer the carrier and the 48 transform or

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the modulating signal and the only real difference in issue here

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is that in the discrete-time case

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
what we're talking about is a periodic

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
convolution because the specter of course a periodic

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
whereas in a continuous-time case it was an a periodic convolution so let's

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
parallel the discussion and in particular what will focus on

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
is first a complex exponential

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
carrier and second a

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
sinusoidal carrier and we'll see how this parallels our discussion in

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
continuous-time

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and will make fairly brief reference as we introduce

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the post carrier for continuous-time will bring make very brief reference to

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the post carrier for discrete-time

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
indicating that again the analysis and discrete-time and continuous-time

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
is very parallel soul let's first consider

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
complex exponential and sinus all carriers

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
for the discrete-time case emphasizing

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the very strong parallel and similarity between

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
discrete-time and continuous-time well

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we have once again the modulation property

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and the modulation property tells us that the spectrum

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
all the modulated signal is the periodic

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
convolution love the two spectra

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and let's consider for example

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
an input for modulating spectrum as i've indicated here

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and since we what to consider first the fall

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
a complex exponential carrier

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
will consider the case of CNN

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
equal to each to the J Omega subsea

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
n and let me stress by the way as

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I did in the continuous-time case

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
dead out 10 to suppress the phase angle which of course can be associated with

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the carrier also

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
alright so we have then the spectrum

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
%uh the modulating signal the spektr the carrier signal

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
if this is the carrier then its spectrum is an impulse train

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and then imposed strain I've indicated

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
here and let me stress also that in

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the discrete-time case of course the spectra

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and all of the spektr involved are periodic with period of two pi

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
so this then is the spectrum of the carrier signal

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
this is the spectrum the input signal the periodic convolution if these two

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
is the spektr on the modulated signal and the result

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
is then this spectrum shifted

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to center frequency which is the carrier frequency

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Omega subsea so

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the result love modulation with a complex exponential

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is a straightforward shifted the spectrum

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to a carrot to so that what occurred around

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
zero frequency now occurs around the frequency Omega subsea

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
now in the continuous-time k sweetie modulated

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
with the case when we had a complex exponential carrier weedy modulated

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
by essentially just shifting the spectrum back

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and he in fact in the discrete-time case were able to do exactly the same thing

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
so if we work to replace

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
see a van which is huge and make a subsidy and

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
by see a very cozy the minus J Omega

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
CN the resulting spectrum

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
would be an impulse train

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
as i indicate here and

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the result all multiply why I have an

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
by that new carrier

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in the frequency domain is a convolution if these two

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and its relatively straightforward to verify that

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
if you can follow these for the periodic convolution

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
then that will get us back to the original spectrum that we started with

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so what's happened in the discrete-time case for the complex exponential

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is exactly the same as in continuous-time

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
namely we might too late that corresponds to shifting the spectrum

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
weedy modulate by multiplying by the complex conjugate

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the original modulating care the original carrier

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and that shifts the spectrum back to where it was originally

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
okay now let's consider the case of a sinusoidal carrier in discrete-time

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and again things very much parallel

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what we saw in continuous-time

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and again as we look at the specter

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will choose a phase angle 0

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
mainly for notational an analytical convenience

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
so in this case now rather than

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a carrier signal which is a single complex exponential

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the sinus or carrier is the summer too

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
complex exponentials

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and so if we consider a modulating spectrum that is the specter affects a

00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
van

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
as something are the type that I indicate here

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and the spectrum of the carrier

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
now since the carrier is sign a soil rather than

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
a complex exponential consists of two impulses

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
wanted pasta makers see and one at minus Omega subsea

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
convolved ing this spectrum with this spectrum

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
gives us a replication affective Omega

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
around plus and minus Omega subsea

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and incidently with an ample to change a hair

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so again things have

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
worked as they did in continuous-time

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
in continuous time or in discrete-time

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
modulating with a sinusoidal carrier

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
with then correspond to a replication of the spectrum

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
around plus the carrier frequency and replication the spectrum

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
around minus the carrier frequency in both cases

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
as long as the carrier frequency is large enough compared with the band with

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the signal

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so that those two replications don't overlap

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
then its reasonable to suppose

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that we should be able to recover the original signal

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
well in fact to d modulate

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in the discrete-time case we would again

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
follow very much the strategy that we did in continuous-time

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in particular let's consider the modulating

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
by taking the modulated signal

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and again putting it through modulator again

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
with a carrier which is co-signed Omega CN

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
if we do that we have a the modulator

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
or what will turn out to be part of the modulator as i indicate here

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the spectrum or the import signal

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
is as I had just developed a replication

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
up the original spectrum around plus and minus Omega subsea

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
with an amplitude of the hair when this

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is again convolved with the spectrum

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
love the carrier then

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we get a replication of the original spectrum

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
first around zero frequency as i indicate here

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and then around twice the carrier frequency

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and minus twice the carrier frequency

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and as long as the carrier frequency

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is large enough compared with the

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
with of the original signal day and as you can see

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
by extracting this part of the spectrum

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
with the low-pass filter we can in principle

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
recover the spectrum associated with the original signal

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and again justice in continuous-time because this amplitude is a half

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we would want to choose for scaling purposes

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
a low-pass filter ample to which is

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to to compensate for this factor in the hair

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
so once again things work at basically

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the same way as they had in continuous-time

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
we have sinusoidal modulation

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
which consists love using a sinusoidal carrier

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and we have the the modulator

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which consists of taking the modulated signal

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
multiplying by the carrier and then

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
processing Matt with a low-pass filter

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to extract the portion of the spectrum

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
which is around zero frequency as i indicate in the spectra below

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and the result then with this low pass filter having a gain of two

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
is that we've recovered the original spectrum

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
exit Omega which is the spectrum

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that we started now

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
several other things to stress this is a fairly quick

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to we're through sinusoidal modulation for discrete-time

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
in there are very similar issues that arise in

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the discrete-time case in terms of love having faced synchronization

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and frequency synchronization between the modulator and demodulator

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and we had discussed that in a fair amount of detail for the continuous-time

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
case in some sense in practical terms

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that becomes much more than issue in continuous-time

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
than it does in discrete-time in part because

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
synchronization between a modulator and demodulator

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is often much harder in a continuous-time

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
system which is essentially an analog system

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
as compared with a digital system another

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
very important reason and it's important to stress this at the outset

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is that whereas the theory involving

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the use of complex exponentials sinusoidal modulation

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
parallels very strongly in the continuous-time

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and the discrete-time case in practical terms

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
it has much more significance in continuous-time

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
than it does in discrete-time that is the notion

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
love sinusoidal modulation in the context of communication systems

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is extremely important for continuous-time systems

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and less so in discrete-time systems

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
now kinda as a preview of a point to be raise later on

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I should modify that slightly with the statement

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that one very important plays in which

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
sinusoidal modulation in a discrete-time context the rises

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is in a class of systems called trance multiplexers or trans modulation systems

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and this surface is basically because

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
so many communication systems are now

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
becoming digital and specifically discrete-time although the actual

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
transmission is continuous time

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the signal processing manipulation switching

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
is discrete-time it so in fact it turns out

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to be very important and useful to take

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
a discrete-time representation I love

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the analog signals a continuous-time signals

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and in a discrete-time or digital representation

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
convert them from one modulation scheme

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
41 multiplexing scheme to another and

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
although I said a lot there that

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
really requires much more detail to

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to develop in any in any sense at all

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you should come to get the notion that that discrete-time

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
modulation systems become very important

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
in part because or implementation Elis use

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
okay now there is another application

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
dead we have discussed for both continuous time actually previously for

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
discrete-time

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
amplitude modulation with sinusoidal or complex exponential carriers

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and let me just remind you that because in fact it becomes a very important one

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
in the case love discrete-time systems

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and that is the notion love using

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
modulation together with fixed filtering

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to implement a filter which is

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which either has a variable cut off or

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
converts let's say a low-pass filter to a high pass filter

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
we originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
in the context of converting a low-pass filter

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to a high pass filter and the notion was

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that if we modulate the signal

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
with a carrier which is -1 to the end and that's just simply complex

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
exponential

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
or sinusoidal carrier with a carrier frequency of pie

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
than that in effect interchanges the low frequencies in the high frequencies

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and if and after modulation

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that is processed with a low pass filter

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and then the result is d modulated

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
using exactly the same carrier namely a carrier which is

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
-1 to the end

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
then the effective that is equivalent

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to high-pass filtering on the original signal

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and a generalization a bad would involve instead a

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
this specific choice if -1 to the end

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
would involve a choice in general or the e to the J Omega sed CNN

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that is a more general carrier frequency and

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
d modulator which is either the minus J

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Omega subsea and and as i've represented here

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
discrete-time signals

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
filter

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
well let me continue the review of that

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
just by reminding you of the details of what happens with the spectra

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and specifically the notion

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
if we take this particular case omega-6 equal

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to pie or covertly a carrier signal which is -1 to the end

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
then if we have the original spectra

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and the specter all

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
specter of the carrier signal the spectrum of the carrier signal

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
convolved with this spectrum

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
will then in effect shift this by

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
pie and so after

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
modulating the result that we have is

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
shifted that spectrum so that what happened at low frequencies now happens

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
at high frequencies namely around pie

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and what happens at what happened at high frequencies now happens

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
at low frequencies well if thats process now

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
with a low pass filter and this dashed line indicates the low-pass filter

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
then the result that we get is shown here

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
where we've extracted the low-frequency portion of the modulated signal

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and now when we modulate or D modulate back

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
then this spectrum is shifted back to where it belongs

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
namely its shifted back to be centered around

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
minus pie and around plus Park

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so if we just compare this spectrum

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
with the original spectrum at the top

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
what we can see is that in effect what we've done

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
is to extract a portion of the spectrum

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
acquittal and the processing with a high pass filter

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and again this is very similar to what we did in continuous-time

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and all of the kinda analytical processes and

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and convolutions involved are very much the same

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
really the biggest difference between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
has to do not so much with the details of the analysis but

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
perhaps has more to do with issues

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
love are practical applications

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
okay well so what we've done

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
so far for continuous-time and discrete-time

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
with complex exponential and sinus or carriers

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
we saw that the analysis is very similar although

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
applications are slightly different and now what I'd like to turn to

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
is a different choice love

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
carrier signal and the carrier signal in this particular case

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
is a post rain rather than

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
a sinusoidal signal now

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the idea is the following

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
in general of course the modulator

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it consists all multiplying x50

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
by whatever the carrier signal is and

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
previously we've talked about a carrier signal which is sinusoidal

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the carrier signal that we want to consider now

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
is a carrier signal which in fact is

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
a pulse train and so in fact

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
what we want to do is multiply the input signal

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
by a Paul strain and in effect then

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
the modulated signal consists

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
of the original signal simply with time slices pulled out a bit as i've

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
indicated in the bottom Kurt

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
so what we have now

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is a modulated signal

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that is a chopped or sliced version

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
love the original waveform and

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
think that is what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
now it seems like it's kinda crazy idea any ideas

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
search opt-out slices away form and

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the hope that you can kinda put things back together again

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and the amazing thing about it is we'll see is that in fact

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
under fairly broad general and applicability

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
conditions you really can put the way for back together again

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
if you just have these times places

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
not only that but that basic notion

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
as we'll see is independent in fact

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
up with the with the those time slices or effect the with can go to zero

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and in fact we're going to make the with go to zero and really only dependent

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
on what the frequency love the polls trainers

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
so let's explore that in some detail

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and what we want to look at is the analysis but let me

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
let me first just comment very briefly there

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
all the analysis we go through as has been true in the case a sinusoidal

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
modulation all the analysis that we go through

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
holes just as well with

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
especially minor analytical modifications to

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
discrete-time pulse amplitude modulation as it does to

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
continuous-time pulse amplitude modulation

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and so will really only go through this

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
in terms of tracking the way for inspector for the continuous-time

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
case but bear in mind that the results are basically similar

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
for discrete-time okay well

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
let's see how we get the basic result

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
that we want to get

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
what we have is a

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
modulating signal which is a pulse train basically a square wave

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and as we've seen in previous lectures the spectra

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
or Fourier transform associated with that is an impulse train

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and the envelope that impulse train

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
is over for over sin x over X function

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the four th transform is impulses and the spacing of the impulses

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
is Associated with the fundamental frequency

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
all the Paul strain and thats Omega Sappi so make it appears to pride

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
divided by the period

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the pulse train and at the

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
amplitude and shape but this envelope is dictated

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
by that parameter Delta

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
which has to do with how wide the pulses are

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
okay so we have a time function

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
it's multiplied by this post rain now we're talking continuous-time

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
so in the frequency domain

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
we have the Fourier transform the time function convolved with

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
this Fourier transform for the pulse train and let's see what that looks like

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
if we were to consider let's say

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
a Fourier transform which I A kinda chosen is more or less a general one

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
then in fact when we can follow this

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
with this simple strain what we end up with

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is a replication all

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
this spectrum at

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the places in the frequency domain

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
where the individual impulses occurred

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
so we can see that this spectrum is replicated at each's

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
these locations and as long as

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the frequency

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
above the post-training is large enough compared

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
with a maximum frequency in the

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
original single X if T so that there is no overlap between these triangles

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
then what you can see in fact somewhat amazingly

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
is dead simply by low-pass filtering the result

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
we can get back except for an amplitude factor

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
we can give get back to the original signal

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
now it's amazing it really is amazing

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
dead all that this depends on

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is the original signal being banned limited

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and the frequency the post-training be high enough

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so that when you replicate the spectrum in the frequency domain

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
is no overlap between these individual replications and will

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
have a dress that a little more in a few minutes

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but let me first the ball point out that

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
this has a whole variety a very important implications

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
one is in the context of communications

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
it leads to another very important

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
multiplexing scheme for communications we talked last time about

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
frequency division multiplexing where individual signals were put into

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
individual frequency slots

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
by choosing different carrier frequencies for sinusoidal modulated

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
signal

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
what this suggests is that what we can do

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is put the

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
sons put different signals into

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
non-overlapping time slots

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and in fact be able to recover the original signals back again

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so in particular suppose that

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I had a signal which I modulated with a pulse train

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and I i chose another signal modulated with another poll strain

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
where the time slot was different and I continue this process

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and after the after i'd done this with some number of channels

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
simply and it all those together

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
as i indicate here then as long as I knew what time slots to associate with

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
what signal

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I could get the original a

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
modulated signals back again

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and then as long as the frequency 0

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the impulse train was such that

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I was able to do this reconstruction

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
by simply low-pass filtering then

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I would be able to be my Julie so it's a very different very important modulation

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
scheme call time division

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
multiplexing in contrast to frequency division multiplexing as we talked about

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
last time

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I made reference earlier the concept of Trance multiplexing and in fact

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
what happens in many communication systems

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
is dead the signals are represented in fact

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
in discrete-time the analog continues time signals are represented in

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
discrete-time

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and very often the conversion from

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
frequency division multiplexing to time division multiplexing and back

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
is done in fact in the discrete-time to me

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
okay so what we have then

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
is the notion

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
dead we can

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
multiply a time function

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
by a poll strain as i indicated here

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and from the output I can

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
if the frequency this post rain is high enough in relation to this band with

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
from the output which consists of both

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
time slices from those times places

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I can recover the original signal

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
stressing again the reason it relates

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
to the spectra and

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the reason is dead the original spectra

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
is simply replicated at

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
multiples all the fundamental frequency

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
upholstery

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
now is a very important thing to observe here

00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
which is dead the ability to do the reconstruction

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
is associated with the notion of whether we can extract that

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
kinda central triangle light happened choose a triangular shape but

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
obviously I could be talking about any shape as long as it's been limited

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the ability to extract at and notice

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
that in this modulated output spectrum

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
the ability to recover this is totally independent

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
all what the value of Delta is in other words

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
if we look back at

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
the modulator then

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
in fact we can make Delta

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the with these pulses arbitrarily small

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and in theory that doesn't affect

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
our ability to do the reconstruction now in practical terms it might

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
looking back once more at the specter of the output

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
noticed that this sample to is proportional to Delta

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and what that suggests is that as we make

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Delta smaller and smaller which we

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
might in fact want to do if you want to time division multiplexed last two

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
channels

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
in principle in theory you could make it an infinite number channels just by

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
making an infinitesimally small

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
the smaller it is in some sense the less energy there is and again

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in practical terms this one of those things if you push down here pops up

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
there

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
namely you eventually run into issues such as noise problems

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
so more more typically what's done is

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
to in fact eliminate the scale factor a delta

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and the way that that's done is very simply

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
it's done by choosing

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the with I love the pulses

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and the height %uh the pulses in such a way

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
dead the area is constant even as

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
we make Delta get arbitrarily small so

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and we can just modify our argument

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
so that what we're referring to is a modulating post rain

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
which is a pulse train with positive with Delta

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and height one over Delta in that case

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
as Delta gets arbitrarily small

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
then in fact what these rectangles become

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
are impulses in which case what we're talking about

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
is a carrier signal

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
which in fact is an impulse train

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and the resulting modulated signal

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is and imposed strain for which the amplitudes

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
of the impulses are proportional to

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the original input waveform at

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the times at which these impulses occur

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
okay well let's look at the analysis a bat

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and so now what we're talking about

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is a spectrum

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
dead up

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
consists all the result

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
love the spectrum we talked about before the sin x over X envelope except

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
that now is Delta goes to zero that becomes

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
flat in other words the modulating signal is an impulse train

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and so as we look at the spectrum

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the modulating signal that is then

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and impose train in the frequency domain the high

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
is proportional to the frequency

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
up the impulse train and Omega the best now denotes

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the frequency the impulse train and

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
the resulting output the modulator

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
has a spectrum which is

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
this original spectrum again replicated around

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
each love these impulses in other words replicated in multiples

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
or the sampling frequency now

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
this is very much identical to the more general case we have

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
this replication the spectra

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and as long as

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
this sample the the frequency of the impulse train is

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
large enough compared with the band with the signal

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
so that these triangles don't overlap

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I can extract this

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
portion of the spectrum by low-pass filtering

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
which in fact with then give us back

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the original signal now

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
if instead this frequency Omega sed am

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is greater than Omega best minus Omega sed am

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
we would have a spectrum that looked

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
something more like this and what's happened

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
in this case is that because

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
we have an overlap here we've destroyed the ability

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to recover the original signal from the impulse train

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and that would be true also in general in a more general case

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
love pulse amplitude modulation with

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
pulses that up 90 with

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
this effect by the way is one that will be

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
exploring in considerably more detail in the next lecture and

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
it's a phenomenon or distortion referred to as a leasing which

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
in fact is important and interesting topic but

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
going back to the case in which we've chosen the frequency of the upholstery

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
in high enough

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
then we would recover the original signal

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
by processing it through

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
a low-pass filter

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and in in that case

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
what this says is dead if we have a signal

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and we modulated with an impulse train

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
if we then process that impulse train through an ideal ok pass filter

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
given the right conditions on Sat on the frequency the impulse train and the band

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
with the signal

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
we can recover the original signal back again

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
now let me stress just going back to

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
the picture in which we have done this modulation

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
that this process where the modulation

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
where the carrier signal involves an impulse train is

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
often referred to as sampling and

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
what that mean specifically is dead

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
if we notice this resulting in polls train

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
is in fact a sequence

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
all samples all

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the original continuous-time signal in other words

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
what we've done in effect is taken instantaneous samples at this way form

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and the implication is that if we do that

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
at a rapid and afraid in relation

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to the band with the signal then

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we can in fact recover the original signal back again

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and finally to remind you

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'll the argument once more

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
we have an original signal

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and we have its spectrum when we've sampled it and this is now the sampled

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
signal it's an impulse train whose instantaneous values

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
are samples at the original waveform the spectrum a bad

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
is the original one replicated

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and when that is processed through a

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
low-pass filter to extract this part of the spectrum

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
then after the low-pass filter we can

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
recover the original signal back again

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
okay well in fact me although

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
a if you kinda follow through

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the specter and the waveforms this all seems fairly

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
straightforward and perhaps

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
or perhaps not obvious

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
it's really worth reflecting on how amazing

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the result really is what it says we begin this discussion

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
by talking about modulation and in fact modulation and sinusoidal modulation is

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
important in its own right

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
we ended the discussion by talking

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
about first pulse amplitude modulation

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and then showing how under the right set of conditions

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you can in fact take away form and

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
sample it with a set of instantaneous samples

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and that said instantaneous samples in fact

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
are sufficient totally represent and reconstruct the signal

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
what in fact the formal statement that is

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
is referred to as the sampling theorem

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
very powerful their own that says

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
if were given equally spaced samples over time function

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and if that time function is band limited

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and if the band with

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
or is or if this if this sampling frequency is

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
chosen in the right way in relation

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to the

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
band with then in fact

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the original time function is

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
uniquely recoverable with a low-pass filter

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
now the sampling theorem is kinda

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I would say a watershed a cornerstone

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
love a lot of the discussion we've been having

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
for a whole variety of reasons if first of all crops out almost as kind as

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
straightforward obvious statement but more importantly

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
what it says is dead

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
if I have a continuous-time signal which satisfies the right-center conditions

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I can represent it by what it does

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
at sampling instance or acquittal only at discrete

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
is this a time

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
now what that leads to

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is a whole host of things wanna which

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
is the statement that says if we have a continuous-time signal

00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I could in fact represented

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
as a discrete-time signal and I could even think

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
love processing a continuous-time signal

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
using discrete time concepts

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and when I'm all done converting back through

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
the power the sampling theorem converting back to a continuous-time

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
sick

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so the sampling theorem provides this

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
with a very major important bridge between

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
continuous-time and discrete-time implementations and ideas

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
in the next several lectures we will be exploring so this in considerable detail

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
first the focus in more next time

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
on some with the specific issues and distortions associated with sampling and

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
following that

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
a discussion are what is referred to as

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,000
thank you
