the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
over the last several lectures we developed the for a representation for

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and continuous-time signals what i'd

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
now like to do is develop a similar representation for discrete-time

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and let me begin a discussion by

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
reminding you up what are basic motivation was the idea

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is that what we wanted to do was exploit the properties

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
love linearity in time and variance for linear time-invariant systems

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so and in the case love

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
linear time-invariant systems the

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
basic idea was to consider

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
decomposing the input as a linear combination

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
love basic inputs and then

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because I've Lenny arity the output could be expressed as

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a linear combination of corresponding outputs where

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
saw I serve I is the output

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
due to fee survive so

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
basically what we attempted to do was decompose the input

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then reconstruct the output through

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
a linear combination all the outputs to those basic inputs

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we then focused on the notion

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
love choosing the basic inputs

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
with two criterion mine one was

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to choose them so that a broad class signals

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
could be constructed out over those basic inputs

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the second was to choose the basic inputs

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so that the response to those was easy to compute

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and as you recall one representation that we ended up with

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
with those basic criteria in mind:

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
was the representation through convolution

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and then in beginning the discussion love the for a representation of

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
continuous-time signals

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
we chose as another said a basic inputs

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
complex exponentials so

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
for continuous-time we chose

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
a set love basic inputs which were complex exponential

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the motivation there was the fact that

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the complex exponentials have we referred to as

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the I can function property namely

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
if we put complex exponentials into our continuous-time systems

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
than the output is a complex exponential

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
love the same form with

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
only a change in complex amplitude

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and that change in complex amplitude is

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
what we referred to as the

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
frequency response %uh the system

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and also by the way as it developed later

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is in fact the 48 transform the continuous-time for EA transform

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
all the system impulse response and

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the notion all decomposing a signal as a linear combination of both these complex

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
exponentials

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is what the first the forty a series

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
representation and then later the Fourier transform representation

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
corresponded to

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and finally to remind you

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
love one additional point the fact is that because the eigenfunction property

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the response

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
once we decompose the input as a linear combination

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
complex exponentials the response to that when your combination

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is straightforward to compute once we know the frequency response

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
because if the eigenfunction property now

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
basically the same strategy

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and many of the same ideas work in discrete-time

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
paralleling almost exactly what happened in continuous-time

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so the similarities between discrete-time and continuous-time

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
are very strong although as we'll see there are a number

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
a differences and it's important

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
as we go through the discussion to illuminate

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
not only the similarities but obviously also the differences

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
well let's begin with the I can function property

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and let me just say that just as in continuous-time

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
if we consider said a basic signals

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
which are complex exponentials

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
then discrete-time linear time-invariant systems

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
have the I can function property namely

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
if we put a complex exponential into the system

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the response is a complex exponential

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at the same complex frequency and

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
simply multiplied by inappropriate

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
complex factor or constant

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and just as we did in

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
continuous-time we will be

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
referring to this complex constant which is a function

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
of course the frequency other complex exponential input

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
will be referring to this as the frequency response

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and although it's not particularly evident at this point

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
as the discussion develops through this lecture what in fact will happen

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is very much paralleling

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
continuous-time this particular expression

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
in fact will correspond

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to what will refer to as the

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
for EA transform the discrete-time Fourier transform

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
up the system impulse response so there of course there's a very strong parallel

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
now just as we did in continuous-time

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
let's begin a discussion by

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
first concentrating on periodic the representation through complex

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
exponentials

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
love periodic sequences and then

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
will generalize that discussion to the representation

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ave periodic signals so

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
let's consider furs a periodic signal

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
or in general signals which are periodic

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
period to notify capital and and then

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
course the fundamental frequency is

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to pie divided by capital

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
now we can consider exponentials

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
which have this as a fundamental frequency

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
war which are harmonics that

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and that would correspond to the class of complex exponentials

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the form you to the JK Omega 0n

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so these complex exponentials then

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
as k varies are complex exponentials

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that are harmonically related with

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
all of which our periodic with the same period

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
capital and although the fundamental period

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is different for each of these each of them being related by

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
an integer amount

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
now again just as we did in continuous time we can consider

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
attempting to build our periodic signal I have a linear combination

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
love these and so we consider

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
a periodic signal which is

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
a weighted sum all these

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
me complex exponentials and

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
of course this periodic signal this is a periodic signal as can be

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
verified in more or less in a straightforward way by substitution

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and of course one of the things that will want to address shortly

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is how broad a classic signals again can be represented

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
by this psalm and another question obviously will be

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
how do we determine the coefficients a suitcase

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
however in before we do that let me

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
focus on an important distinction

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in the context of these complex exponentials and this representation

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
when we talked about complex exponentials and sinusoids

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
early in the cores one up the difference is that we saw between continuous-time

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and discrete-time

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is dead in continuous-time as we very

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
in the frequency variable we see different complex exponentials

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
as Omega berries whereas in discrete-time

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
we saw in fact dead there was a period this city

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
or said another way it's straightforward to verify

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that if we think I love this

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
class a complex exponentials day

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in fact if we consider burying

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
K by an ink to it

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
capital and where capital and is the period

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
all the fundamental

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
complex exponential then in fact

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
if we replace K by K plus capital and

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we'll see exactly the same complex exponentials over again

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
now what does that say what it says is that if I consider this class of complex

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
exponentials

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SK varies from zero

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
through capital N -1 we've seen

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
we will see all of the ones that there are two see

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
there aren't any more and so in fact

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
if we can build excessive and

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I have this linear combination then

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
we better be able to do it as k varies

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
from 0

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
up to and -1 because

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
beyond that will simply see the same complex s

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
exponentials over again so for example

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
if k takes on the value capital and

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that will be exactly the same complex exponential

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
as if KZ 0

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
so in fact this some ranges

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
only over capital in above the distinct complex exponentials

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
let's say for example from 0 to capital and -1

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
although in fact since these complex exponentials repeat

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
in K I could actually consider instead have

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
from 0 to N -1 I could consider from one

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and or from to too and plus one or whatever

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
or said another way in this representation

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I could alternatively shoes K

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
outside this range thinking

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
0 these coefficients simply as periodically repeating in K

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
because if the fact that these complex exponentials

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
periodically repeating K so in fact

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in place if this expression it will be comin in writing the forty a series

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
expression

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to write it as i've indicated here where the implication is

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that these Fourier coefficients

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
periodically repeated as K continues to rip

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to repeat outside the interval from 0 to N -1

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and so this notation in fact says

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
at what we're going to use are

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is K ranging over one period

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
love this periodic sequence which is the forty a series called

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
visions okay so

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the expression that we have been for the forty a series

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've repeated here and the implication now is that

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the AC K's are periodic they periodically repeat because of course

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
these exponentials periodically repeated

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
this indicates there we only use them over one period

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and now we can inquire as to how

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we determine the coefficients aces K

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
well we can formally go through this much as we did in

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the continuous-time case in and 0

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
we do in fact do that in the text which involves substituting some

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
sums in a change in yours summation cetera

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but let me a draw your attention to the fact that

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
this in fact can be thought I love

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
as capital in equations in capital and unknowns

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in other words we know x7 over a period

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and so we know what the left hand side if this is for capital and bad news

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and we'd like to determine these constant sese K

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
well it turns out that their is a nice convening in closed form expression for

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and in fact if we evaluate the closed-form expression

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
through any variety of algebraic manipulations

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
we end up then with the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
analysis equation and the analysis equation

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
which tells us how to get the coefficients AC K

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
from excessive and is what I've

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
indicated here and

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
so this tells us how for Maxim and

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to get the AC K's and of course the first equation

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
tells us how x7 is built up by the VA's

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
K's notice incidently that

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
there is a strong to our the between these two equations

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and that's a duality that will return to

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
actually toward the end of the next lecture now

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
there is a real difference between the way those equations look

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and the way the continuous-time forty a series look

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
in a continuous-time case let me remind you

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that it required

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
an infinite number of coefficients to build up this continuous-time

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
function and so this was not simply a matter

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
of identifying how to invert capital and

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
were a finite number of equations in a finite number upon owns

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and the analysis equation was

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and integration as opposed to the synthesis equation

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
which is a summation so

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
their is a real difference there between

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
the continuous-time and discrete-time cases and a difference

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
arises to a large extent because

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
all this notion that in discrete-time the complex exponentials

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
are periodic in

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
their frequency so we have been to summarize

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the synthesis equation and the analysis equation

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
for the discrete-time for a series

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
again x7 are original signals periodic

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and of course the complex exponentials

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
involve the periodic their periodic obviously in an

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
by it in contrast the continuous-time these repeat

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
in K in other words as k Omega 0

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
goes outside arrange that covers a 25 interval

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and because if that we're imposing

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
in a sense the interpretation that the AC Kesar likewise the periodic sequence

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and in fact we look at the analysis equation

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
as we let K very

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
outside the range from 0 to N -1

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
what you can easily verified by substitution in here

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is that this sequence will in fact periodically repeat

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
so to underscore the difference between the continuous-time and discrete-time

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
cases

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we have this periodicity in the time domain

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and that's a periodicity dad is of course true in discrete-time

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and it's also true in continuous-time

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
if we replace the integer variable

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
by the discrete-time time variable

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and we also indiscreet I'm have this periodicity

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
in krak Omega 0 and correspondingly

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
a periodicity in the four EA coefficients

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and bad is center properties

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
dat does not happen

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in continuous-time and is bad

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
there essentially leads to all of the important differences between

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
discrete-time Fourier representations and in continuous-time

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Korea representation

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
now just quickly let me draw your attention to the issue

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
love convergence and when a sequence can and can't be represented at cetera

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
a recall that in the continuous-time case

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
we focused on convergence in the context either

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
conditions which are referred to as where the group believe the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
or another set of conditions which were the the Ridgeway conditions

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and there was this issue about when the signal doesn't doesn't convergent

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
discontinuities

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
center let me just simply draw your attention to the fact

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
there in the discrete-time case

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what we have is the representation of the periodic signal

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
as Assam all a finite number

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
turns this represents capital and equations in capital and unknowns

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
if we consider the partial some namely taking

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
a smaller number turns then simply what happens

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
is as the number of turns increases

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
to the finite number required to represent

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
ex-dividend we simply end up with

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the partial some representing the fun and Lightsey

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
were all that boils down to is the statement

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that in discrete-time there really are

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
no convergence issues as they were in continues time

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
okay well let's look at an example love the four EA

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
series representation for a particular signal

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and the one that I think here is a simple one

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
namely a constant a

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
are signed term and a cosine term

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
now for this particular example we can expand this out

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
directly in terms of complex exponentials

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and essentially recognize this as a somewhat complex exponentials

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
its examined in more detail

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in example 5.2 in attacks

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and if we looked at the for a series coefficients we can either look

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
at it in terms of real and imaginary parts are magnitude and angle

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
on the left side here I have the real part of the 48 coefficients

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and let me draw your attention to the fact

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
their I've drawn yes

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to specifically illuminate the periodicity

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
other for a series coefficients in with a period of capital and so here are the

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Fourier coefficients

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
are and in fact its this line that represents the DCR constant term

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and these two lines represent the

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
co-signed term and of course this

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
these are the three turns that are required or equivalent leave this one

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,000
this one

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and this one and then because the period this city

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the for a series coefficients this simply periodically repeats

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so here is the real part and below it I show

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the imaginary part and

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
in the imaginary part incidently let me

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
draw your attention to the fact dead its

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
this term and this term

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
there represent in the imaginary part that represent the sinusoid

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
whereas its the symmetric turns the real part

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the represent the cosine okay let's

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in look at another example

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
this is another example from the tax and one

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that will be making frequent reference to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
in this particular lecture

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and what it is is

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
a square wave and

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I've express the for a series coefficients which are out algebraically

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
developed in attacks

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I've expressed the for a series coefficients as

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
samples all an envelope

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
function and so I've expressed that as samples if this

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
particular function which is referred to as a sign

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
enacts over sin x function and let me just compare it

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to a continuous-time example which is the

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
continuous-time square wave

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
where with the continuous times square wave

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the form or the for a series coefficients

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
was as samples love what we refer to

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
as a sin x over expunge

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
now the sin NX

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
over sin x function which is the envelope for the for a series

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
coefficients

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
for the discrete-time periodic square wave

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
plays the role and we'll see it very often in discrete-time

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
that sin x over exercise in continuous-time

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and in fact we should understand right from the beginning

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that the sin x over extend below couldn't possibly be

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
the envelope the discrete-time for a series coefficients

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and one obvious reason is dead

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
it is not periodic what we require of course

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
from the discussion I just going through is periodicity

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
are the coefficients and consequently also periodicity of the envelope

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
in the discrete-time case so once again if we look back

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
at the algebraic expression that I have

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it samples about the sign an X over sin x

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
function dead represent the for a series coefficients

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
love this periodic square way

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
now in the representation in

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the continuous-time case we

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
essentially head use the concept of an envelope

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
to represent the for a series coefficients

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and the notion that the for a series coefficients were samples

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
up an envelope and that is said the same notion

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
there will be using in discrete-time so

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
again for this square wave example

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
then what we have is an envelope

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
function the sign acts

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
over sin x envelope function for

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
a particular value of the period here indicated with a period

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
love 10 samples these

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
samples at this envelope function with then

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
represent the for a series coefficients

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
if we increased

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the period then

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
we would simply have a finer spacing

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
on the samples are the envelope function

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
to get the 40 a series coefficients and

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
in likewise if we increase the period still further

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
what we would have is an even finer space

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
so actually as the period increases recall we use this in the in

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
continuous-time also

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
as the period increases we can view the for a series coefficients

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
samples of an envelope and as the period increases

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the sample spacing gets finer and finer

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and in fact as the period goes

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
of essentially to infinity the samples of the envelope

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
in effect become the anvil and recall also

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that this was essentially the trip that we use

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
in continuous-time to allow us

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to develop or utilize the 48 series

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
to provide a representation %uh a periodic signals

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
as a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
in particular what we did in

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the continuous-time case

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
when we head and a periodic signal

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
was to consider constructing a periodic signal

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
for which be a periodic signal was one period

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and then we developed the notion there since

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the periodic signal has a forty eight series

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and since as the period

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the periodic signal increases n goes to infinity

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
the periodic signal represents the a periodic signal

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
then essentially the 48 series

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
provides us with the representation now

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
we can do exactly the same thing in the discrete-time case

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the statement is exactly the same except dead in a discrete-time case

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
instead of see as the independent variable

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
we simply make exactly the same statement

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but with are discrete-time variable

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and so the basic notion then in representing

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
a discrete-time a periodic signal

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
is to first construct

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
a periodic signal here we have the

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
a periodic signal reconstruct a periodic signal

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
by simply periodically replicating the a periodic signal

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the periodic signal in the a periodic signal are identical

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
for one period and as

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the period goes off to infinity

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it's the forty a series representation of the periodic signal

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that provides a representation all

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
the a periodic signal again

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to returned to the example

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
that we

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
have been kinda working through this lecture namely the periodic square wave

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
if we have in a periodic signal which is a rectangle

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and reconstruct the periodic signal

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and now we consider letting this period increase to infinity

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we would first have this set of samples of the envelope

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
as the period increases we would decrease the sample spacing to this set

00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
of samples

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
as the period increases further it would be

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
this set of samples and as the period goes off to infinity

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
its every point on the envelope in fact

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
what the representation up the a periodic signal

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is is the anvil

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
okay well so that's the basic notion it's no different than what we did

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
in the continuous-time case and

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
mathematically it develops in

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
very much the same way as in the continuous-time

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
case specifically

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
here is our representation

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
through the forty a series all the

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
here here's a representation through the envelope function

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and this is the 48 series synthesis equation where

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
equation the equation below tells us

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
how we'd get these for EA coefficients

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
or the envelope from accident

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
now extolled event is the periodic signal and we know that

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
over one period which is the only interval over which we use it

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
in fact this is identical to the a periodic signal

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
its own fact we can rewrite this equation

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
simply by substituting instead effect told The

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the original a periodic signal and now

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we can use infinite limits on this some and

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
what we would want to examine mathematically is

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
what happens to the top equation

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
as to the top equation as we let the period

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
go off to infinity and what happens is

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
exactly identical mathematically to continuous-time

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I won't the labor the details essentially

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
its this some that goes to an integral

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Omega 0 which is the fundamental frequency is going

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
toward zero in fact becomes the differential in the integral

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and in the second equation of course this then becomes excessive Omega

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and as n goes to infinity then

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
what the for a series becomes is the 48 transform

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
as summarized by the bottom to

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
equations so although

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
there are is a little bit mathematical

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
trickery year but I called trickery but subtlety

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to be tracked through in detail the important conceptual thing to think

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
about

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
is this notion dead

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
we take the a periodic signal for periodic signal let the period go off to

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
infinity

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
which case the forty a series coefficients became these

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
envelope function and incidently mathematically

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
one of the sons ends up going to an integral

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
so what we have then is

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the discrete-time for EA transform

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
which is a representation all

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and a periodic signal and we have

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
the synthesis equation which I show as the top equation honest

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
transparency and this

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
is the integral that the four East series

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
synthesis equation went to as the period when off to infinity

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and we have the corresponding analysis equation

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which is shown below where this tells us the 48 transform

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
in effect the envelope all the for a series coefficients

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
love that periodic signal in and here

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
represented interns love the a periodic signal

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
okay so we have the analysis equation synthesis equation

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
there are a number of things to focus

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
on as you look at this and we'll talk about so its properties

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
actually in the next lecture by it sold them the

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
points the I'd like you to think about a focus on

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
the fact that now there

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
is somewhat have an imbalance or lack of duality between the time-domain and

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
frequency-domain

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
x seven witches are a periodic signal is a course

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
discrete its Fourier transform

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Xserve Omega is a function love a continuous variable

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Omega is a continuous variable that that

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and that is essentially what represents the envelope

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
also in the time domain x7 is

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
a periodic its not a periodic function

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
however in the frequency domain remember that the for a series coefficients were

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
always periodic

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
well this envelope function then is also periodic

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
with a period in omega up to par i

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
what's again the reason for the periodicity it all stems back to the

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
fact

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
there when we talk about complex exponentials

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and recall back to the early lectures in discrete-time

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
as the frequency variable covers a range

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
all to parlay when you proceed past that range

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you simply see the same complex exponentials over and over again

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and so obviously anything that we do with them would have to be periodic

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
in that frequency variable alright notation Lee

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and will again represent the

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
discrete-time Fourier transform here as i indicate here

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and sense is a complex function of frequency

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
may on occasion want to either represented

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
in rectangular form as i indicated this equation

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
or in polar for as i indicate in this equation

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
all right let's and look at an example

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and of course one example that

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
we can look at is the one that has kind of been tracking this

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
through this lecture which is the example

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
love a rectangle now

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the rectangle if we refer back to our

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
argument love how we get a for a representation for a periodic signal

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
we would form a periodic signal where this is repeated

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and thats are square wave example as the period goes to infinity

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the forty a transformer this is represented by the envelope

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
all those for a series coefficients and that was

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
are sign an X over sin x function

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which in this particular case for these particular numbers

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
is sin 5 Omega over to

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
divided by sign Omega over to

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and notice of course as we would expect

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that notice that this is a

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
periodic function all the frequency variable Omega

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
repeating of course with a period up to par

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
whereas in the time domain the function was not

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
a periodic function it's a period

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
now let's look at another example

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in let's look at example

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
which is another signal that has

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
kinda popped its head up from time to time as the lectures have gone along

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
signal which is another a periodic signal which is a decaying exponential

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
of this form with the

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
factor a chosen between 0&1

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and you can workout the algebra

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
at your leisure basically if we substituted to the four EA

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
transform analysis equation its

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
this summer we evaluate because we have a unit step here

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
which shots this of for and less than zero

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
we can change the limits on the some this then corresponds

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
to the some over an infinite number turns

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
geometric series and that as we've seen before

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
is one divided by one minus a

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you to the minus jail make so

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
let's look at what that looks like

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
here him then we have again

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the expression in the time domain

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and the expression in the frequency domain

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and lets in particular focus I N what the magnitude of the Fourier transform

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
looks like

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
its as we show here

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and for the particular values

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Ave that I picked namely between 0&1

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
its larger at the origin then it is upon I

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and then of course it is periodic

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and the periodicity is inherent in the Fourier transform in discrete-time

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
so we really might only need to look at this either from minus

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
fired upon by or from 0 to 2pi

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the periodicity of course would imply what the rest at this is for other

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
values have or make it

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
let me also draw your attention at war on it

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
the fact dead observed at if

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
a were in fact negative then

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
this value would be less than this value

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and in fact for a negative

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
the magnitude the frequency response would look like this except shifted

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
by an amount in omega equal the pie

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and this example will come up

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and play an important role in our discussion next time

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so try to keep it in mind in fact work it out more carefully between

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
now and next time and also if you have a chance

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
focus on this issue love how it looks

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
with a positive is compared with a negative

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
okay now we developed the 48 transform

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
by beginning with the forty a series we did that in continuous time also

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
but I'd like to do now just as we did in continuous-time

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
is now absorb the forty a series

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
within the broader framework above the 40 a transport

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and there are two relationships between the forty a series the Fourier transform

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
which are identical to relationships that we had

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
in the continuous-time case

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
let me remind you dead in

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
continuous-time we head

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the statement there if we have a periodic signal

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
that in fact the forty a series coefficients that periodic signal

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is proportional to

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the two samples of the Fourier transform

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
all one period well

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in fact thats let me remind you flows

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
easily from all other things that we've built up

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
so far because of the fact that the for a transformer sexually

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
by definition love the way we developed it

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
is what we get as

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the forty-a series coefficients

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
as we focus on one period and then let the period go off to infinity

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
well thats looking at one period before a transformer that then

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is the envelope above the 40 a series coefficients

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and so in continuous-time we have

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
this relationship and in discrete-time

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
we have precisely the same relationship

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
except that here we're talking about

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
an integer variable and as opposed to the continuous variable and a period of

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
capital and

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
as opposed to a period

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
love t0 okay so

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
once again if we returned to

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
our example

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
if or Fri return to a periodic signal

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
we have a periodic signal and we consider

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the for EA transform love

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
one period the for a series coefficients

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
this periodic signal are in fact

00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
samples as stated

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
mathematically in the bottom equation samples

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
love the four EA transform all

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
one period so XO makers the for a transformer one period

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
a suitcase at a4e series coefficients at the periodic signal

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
and this relationship simply says their related except for a scale factor

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
through samples along the frequency axis

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and and the chorus we saw this

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
in the context all our

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
square wave example in a square wave

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
example we have a periodic signal

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
which is a periodic square wave

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and the for EA transform

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
a one period in fact represents

00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
the on below and here we have the envelope function

00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
represents the envelope or the forty a series coefficients

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and the for a series coefficients are samples

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
so what we have been is

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
a relationship back to before a series coefficients from the Fourier transform

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
that tells us that for periodic signal now

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the periodic signal the for a series coefficients

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
are related are samples of the Fourier transform

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
one period now

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
finally to kinda bring things back in a circle

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and exactly identical to what we did it in the continuous-time

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
case we can finally absorber

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the 48 series indiscreet

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
time we can absorb it into the framework

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
all the four EA transport now

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
remember or recall how we did at when

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
re tried to do a similar sort of thing

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
in continuous-time in continuous-time

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
what we essentially did is

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
to develop that more less by definition

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
we have occurred we have a periodic signal

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the periodic signal is represented through 48 series

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
in forty a series coefficients essentially

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
when I pointed out at that time was that if we define

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and take it as a definition before a transformer the periodic signal

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
as an impulse train where the amplitudes at the impulses are proportional

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to the forty a series coefficients

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
if we take an impulse train representation

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and simply plug it in

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to the for EA

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
transform synthesis equation what we end up with

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
is the for you see recent this equation

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so in continuous-time

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
we bad done

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
we had used this definition I love

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the discrete-time up the continuous-time

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
for EA transform other periodic signal

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and again in discrete-time it's simply a matter

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
love using exactly the same expression

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and using instead the appropriate

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
variables related to discrete-time rather than the variables related to

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
continuous-time

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
so in discrete-time if we have a periodic signal

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the Fourier transform that periodic signal

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
is defined as an impulse train where the

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
amplitudes up the impulses

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
are proportional to the forty a series coefficients

00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
for the 48 transform we will simply that will simply then reduced to

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
this synthesis equation for the forty a series

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so wants more returning to

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
our example which is the square wave example that we carry through these

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
lectures

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
or through this lecture we can see that

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
really what we're talking about really is a notational change

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
here is the four EA here is the periodic signal

00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and below it are the forty a series

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
coefficients where I've removed the envelope function just indicate

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
the airport to the coefficients index of course on the coefficient number

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and so this represents a bar graph and

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
if instead of talking about the for a series coefficients

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
what I want to talk about are the

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
is the four EA transform the Fourier transform

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
in essence corresponds to simply redrawing mad

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
using impulses and using

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
an axis that is essentially

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
index on the fundamental frequency Omega

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
rather than on the four EA series coefficient number

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
K

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
okay in so

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
to summarize what we've done

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
is to pretty much parallel

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
are somewhat more quickly the kind of development that we went through

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
for continuous-time representation through complex exponentials

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
parallel that for the discrete-time case

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and pretty much the conceptual underpinnings that the development are

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
identical

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
in discrete-time and in continuous time

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
we saw there'd their are

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
some major differences are important differences between continuous-time and

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
discrete-time

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm and the difference essentially

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
relates to two aspect one aspect is the fact that

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
in discrete-time we have a discrete representation in the time domain

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
whereas the independent variable in the frequency domain

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is a continuous variable whereas in continuous-time

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
for the Fourier transform we had duality between the time-domain and

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
frequency-domain

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the other very important difference tied back to the difference between complex

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
exponentials continuous-time and discrete-time

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
in continuous-time complex exponentials as you very the frequency

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
generate distinct

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
time functions in discrete-time as you very the frequency

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
once you've covered a frequency interval to pie

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
then you've seen all the ones there are two see there are no more

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in this in a fact imposes a periodicity

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
on the 48 domain representation of discrete-time signals

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and those so those differences and of course lots the similarities

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
will surface both as we use this representation

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and as we develop for the property

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
in the next lecture what will do is

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
to focus and again on the Fourier transform the discrete-time Fourier

00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
transform

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
develop or eliminate so love the property serv the trip or a transform

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and then see how these properties can be used

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
for a number of things for example how the properties as they were in

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
continuous-time

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
can be used to efficiently

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
generate the solution and analyze when your constant coefficient difference

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
equations

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and then beyond that the concepts of

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
filtering and modulation and

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the both the properties and interpretation which will very strongly

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
parallel

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
the kinds of developments along those lines that we did in the last night

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
thank you
