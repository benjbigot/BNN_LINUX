the in

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the new the we concluded the last lecture

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with the statement above the sampling theorem and just as a quick reminder

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the sampling theorem said that

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
if we have a continuous-time signal

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and we have equally spaced samples

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
all that signal sampled at a sampling period which a indicators capital T

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and if except he is banned limited

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in other words the forty a transformer 0

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
outside some band where Omega Sapan

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is the highest frequency then

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two-part divided by

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the period

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is greater than twice the highest frequency

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the original signal is uniquely

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
recoverable from the set of samples and

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the sampling theorem essentially was derived by

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
observing or using the notion that

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
sampling could be done by multiplication

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or modulation with an impulse train and the sampling theorem develop

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
by examining the consequence

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
love the modulation property in the context of the Fourier transform

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in particular if we have our signal accept T

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and it's multiplied by an impulse train

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to give us a sampled signal

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
another impose train whose values or areas are samples of the original time

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
function

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
as i indicate here then

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
in fact if we examine this equation or equivalently

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
bringing accept T inside this some

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
if we examine either if these equations in the frequency domain

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the four EA transform love

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
exe PFT is the convolution

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
above the 40 a transformer the original signal and the Fourier transform

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
up the impulse train now

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
be imposed strain is a periodic signal its Fourier transform

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
therefore as we talked about with Fourier transforms itself an impulse

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
train

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and when we do this convolution n

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
using the fact that the 48 race for the imposed strain

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is an impulse train the result

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
or this convolution then tells us

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that the 48 transform love

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the sampled signal or the impulse train

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
which represents the samples is a some

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
love frequency shifted replications

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
up the 48 transform of the original signal

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
so mathematically

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that's the relationship it essentially says that after sampling or modulation

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
with an impulse train

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the resulting spectrum is the original spectrum

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
added to itself shifted by multiples

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
integer multiples of the sampling frequency well

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
let's see that as we did last time in terms of pictures

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and again to remind you of the basic

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
picture involved if we have an original signal

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
with the spectrum is a indicated here where

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
its ban limited with the highest frequency Omega Savannah M

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and if the time function is sample

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
so that in the frequency domain week involved this spectrum

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
with the spectrum shown below which is the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
spectrum love the impulse train

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the convolution if these true up these two

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
is then the Fourier transform or spectrum

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
love the sampled time function

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and so thats what we end up with here

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and then as you recall to recover the original time function

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
from this as long as these individual triangles don't overlap

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to recover it just simply involves

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
passing the impulse train through a low-pass filter in effect

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
extracting just one of these replications

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
love the original spectrum

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so the overall system

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
then for for doing the sampling and then

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the reconstruction of the original signal from the samples

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
consists of multiplying the original time function

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
by an impulse train and that gives us

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
then the sampled signal

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the Fourier transform I show here love the

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
original signal and after modulation with the impulse train

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the resulting spectrum that we have is

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and then finally to recover

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the original signal or to generate a reconstructed signal

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
we then multiply this in the frequency domain

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
by the frequency response of an idea low-pass filter

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and what that accomplishes forest and

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is recovering the original signal

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
now in this picture an important point that I raise last time

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
relates to the fact dead in doing the reconstruction

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
well we've assumed is dead in replicating

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
these individual versions

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
0 the original signal

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
those replications don't overlap and sold by passing this through a low-pass

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
filter in fact

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
we can recover the original signal well

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
what that requires is that

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
this frequency Omega Savannah M be less than

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
this frequency and this frequency

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is Omega so fast minus Omega serve them

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and so what we require is dead the frequency Omega Sapan

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
be less than Omega cyb s minus Omega sed am

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
or equivalent Lee what we require is that the sampling frequency

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
be greater and twice the highest frequency

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
in the original signal now

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
if in fact that condition is violated

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
then we end up with a very important effect

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and that effect is referred to as a leasing

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in particular if we look back at are

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
original example we're here

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
we were able to recover our original spectrum by

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
low-pass filtering if in fact

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the sampling frequency is

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
not high enough to avoid aliasing

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
then what happens in that case is that the individual replications

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
love the Fourier transform above the stove the original signal

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
overlap and what we end up with

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is some distortion as you can see if we tried to pass this through a low-pass

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
filter

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to recover the original signal in fact we won't recover the original signal

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
since these individual replications have overlapped

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and this is the case where Omega service minus Omega Savannah is less than

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Omega so vast in other words the sampling frequency is not greater

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
in this case than twice the highest frequency

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
so what happens here then is that in effect

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
higher frequencies get folded down into lower frequencies what would come out of

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the low-pass filter

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is the reflection of some higher frequencies into lower frequencies

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
as I suggested a minute ago that affect

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is referred to as alias saying and in order to

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
both understand that term better and two understand in fact the effect better

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it's useful to examine this a little more closely

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
for the specific example a sinusoidal signal

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
so let's concentrate on that and what we want to look at

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
is the effect or alias saying

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
when our input signal is a sinusoidal signal

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
now to do that what I wanna show shortly

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is a computer-generated movie

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
that we've made and let's first walk-through

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
a few frames a bit to give you our first of all

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to to set up our notation and to suggest what it is that we're trying to

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
demonstrate

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
well what we have is an input signal

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
is a sinusoidal signal and

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the spectrum or for a transformer that

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
is an impulse in the frequency domain at

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the frequency the sinusoid we then

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
have samples love that and when we sample that in for this particular

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
example its sample the 10 killer hurts

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
this spectrum is then replicated

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
at multiples all the sampling frequency

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and I haven't shown negative frequencies here but the contribution do

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to the negative frequency

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
is at 10 killer hurts minus the input sinusoid

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we then carry out a reconstruction

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with an idea low-pass filter and the ideal ok pass filter is set at

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
half the sampling frequency or five kelleher its

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
so what we have then is

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the input signal accept T

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the impulse train exe PFT

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and then the reconstructed signal is

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the output from the low-pass filter

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which I denote as X a party

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
now as the input frequency X 50

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
increases this impulse moves up in frequency

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
but this impulse moves down in frequency

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and so let's just look at a few frames as the input frequency increases

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
so we have here a case

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
where the input frequency has move up

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
close to five killer hurts

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
as we continue further these two impossible's

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
will cross and what we'll end up with as i indicated

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is aliasing so here now is a case

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
where we have alias saying the

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
replication of the negative frequency has crossed into the passband if the

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
filter

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and the reconstructed sinusoid will now

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
be the frequency associated with this impulse

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
rather than the frequency Associated

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
with the original sinusoid and to dramatize that

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
even further here is

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the example where now the input frequency

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
has moved up close to 10 killer hurts

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
but what comes out of the low-pass filter

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
is a much lower frequency and in fact

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you can see that here is the reconstructed sinusoid

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
whereas here we have the input size

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
okay well now what I'm gonna wanna do is

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
demonstrate this as i indicated with a computer-generated movie

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and well we'll see is the effect

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
on the effect of reconstructing

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
from the samples using a low-pass filter

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
for an input which changes in frequency

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and with the sampling rate of 10 killer hurts

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and what we'll see in the first part of this movie is

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the input except the and the reconstructed signal

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
X a party without explicitly showing the samples

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and then at a later point will also show this and indicate

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that in fact the samples are those two are equal even though

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
they themselves are not

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
so at the top will have the input sinusoid without

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
showing the samples and its

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
for EA transform is an impulse in the frequency domain as we've indicated

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and if we sample it that imposed and gets replicated

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and so samples in particular

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
will have a Fourier transform not only with an impulse

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
at the input sinusoid sinusoidal frequency but also attend killer hurts

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
minus that frequency

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
now for the reconstruction we pass the samples through an idea low-pass filter

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I picked

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter at half the sampling frequency

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
namely 5 killer hurts

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and here we see is that the output

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
reconstructed signal in fact matches in frequency the input signal

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
now as we change the input frequency

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the reconstructed sinus so it is identical

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
until we get to an input frequency

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
which exceeds half the sampling frequency

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
at that point we have aliasing and while the input frequency is increasing

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the output frequency in fact is decreasing

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
because that's what's inside the passband the filter

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
now let's sweep it back and as the input frequency decreases the output frequency

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
increases

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
till there's no aliasing and now the output reconstructed

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
signal is equal to the input

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
so we sample the signal and then reconstructed

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the signal from the samples and keep in mind

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that given a set of samples there are lots of continuous curves that we can

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
thread through the set of samples

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the one that we picked up cores is the one consistent

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
with the assumption about the signal band with

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
in particular we've reconstructed the signal

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that who spectrum falls within the pass band at the filter

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
now what I'd like to show is the same

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
reconstruction and input as I showed before

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but now let's look at the samples and what we'll see is that

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
when there's alias saying even though

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
the output the reconstructed signal

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is not identical to the input in fact

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it's consistent with the input samples that is sampling the reconstructed

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
signal

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
gives a set of samples identical to the samples at the input

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and it's just that the interpolation in between those samples

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
is an interpolation consistent with you soon

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
fan with love the input based on the sampling there

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
so let's now look at that with

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the samples also shown along with the sinusoid

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
so at the top we have the input sinusoid together with its samples

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the bottom traces the Fourier transform of the sampled waveform

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the middle trace is the reconstructed

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
sinusoid together with its samples and notice of course that the samples are

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the input a reconstructed signal

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
are identical and also

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the input sinusoidal frequency

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and the output sinus or frequency are identical

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we now increase the frequency at the input

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
the reconstructed sinusoid tracks the input frequency

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and of course the samples are the two are identical

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the interpolation in between the samples is identical

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because the fact dead the input frequency is still

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
less than half the sampling frequency

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and so as long as the input is frequency is less than half the sampling frequency

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
not only will the samples be identical but also

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the reconstructed continuous waveform will match

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
the input way for

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
now when we get to hear the sampling frequency were just

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
on the verge Bailey is saying this isn't alias saying

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
quite yet but any increase in the input frequency

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
will now generate aliasing we now have a leasing

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the output frequency is lower than the input frequency but notice

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that the samples are identical now

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the low-pass filter is interpolating in between those samples

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
with a sinusoid that falls within the past Pandev the low-pass filter

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
which no longer matches the frequency of the input sinusoid but

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the important point is that even when we have alias saying

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the samples are the reconstructed waveform

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
are identical to the samples

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
of the original way for and notice that as the input frequency increases

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
in fact the interpolated output the reconstructed output

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
has decreased in frequency now as the input frequency begins to get closer to

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
10 killer hurts in fact you're all I

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
tends to also interpolate between the samples

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
with a frequency that is lower

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
day and the input frequency NS particularly evident

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
here notice that the input samples in fact

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
look like they would be associated

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
with a much lower frequency sinusoid then in fact

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
was the sinusoid the generated a lower frequency sinusoid

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
in fact corresponds to the reconstructed one now as we sit back down

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the aliasing eventually disappears and the output sinus or tracks the input

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
sinusoid in frequency

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
so we've seen the

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
effective aliasing for sinusoidal signals and turns away forms

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
now let's hear how it sounds now

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
what we have for this demonstration is

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
an oscillator and

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
a sampler and the output of the sampler

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
goes into a low-pass filter so the

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
input for from the oscillator goes into the sampler

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and the output the sampler

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
goes into the low-pass filter the

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
sampler frequency is 10 killer hurts

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and so the low-pass filter

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
has a cutoff frequency as i indicate here

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
all five killer hurts and

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
what will listened to is the

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
reconstructed output as the

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
oscillator input frequency berries

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and recall there what should happen is that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
when the oscillator input frequency gets past half the sampling frequency

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
we should hear aliasing so we'll start the oscillator it to kill her ex

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and keep in mind that what you see on the dial

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
is the input frequency which you here is the output frequency

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
as long as the input frequency is less than half the sampling frequency in

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
other words 5 killer hurts

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
the reconstructed signal sounds identical to the input

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
now at five still hurts were right

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
on the verge of aliasing and when we increase the input frequency past five

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
killer hurts

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the reconstructed frequency in fact will decrease

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
so as we move for example from 5 killer hurts

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
up to let's say 6 killer hurts

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
sick still hurts in fact yes alias

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
down to what gets alias down to

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
4 killer us so

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
6 go over to the input is for killer hurts

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
at the output now if we move up even further

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
7 kilohertz at the end pushed its alias down

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to three killer hurts at the outpost

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so bad dan is a audio demonstration and aliasing

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so to summarize

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
if we sample signal and then reconstruct

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
from the samples using a low-pass filter as long as the sampling frequency is

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
we reconstruct exactly if on the other hand

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
the sampling frequency is too low less than twice the highest frequency

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
then we get alias saying in other words

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
higher frequencies get folded or reflected

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
down into lower frequencies as they come through the low-pass filter

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
now wanted the

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
common applications love the whole concept of sampling

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is the use sampling to convert a continuous-time signal into a

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
discrete-time signal to carry out

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
what's often referred to as discreet I processing

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
of continuous-time signals and this in fact is something that will be talking

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
about

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
in a fair amount of detail beginning with the next lecture

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but and let me indicate that for

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that kinda processing essentially what happens

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
is dead we begin with a continuous-time signal

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and convert it to a discrete-time signal

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
carry out the discrete-time processing and then

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
convert back to continuous-time and

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the conversion from a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
signal in fact is done

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
by exploiting sampling specifically

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
by sampling the continuous-time signal

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
with an impulse train and then

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
converting the impulse train into

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
a sequence in a manner that all talk about in more detail

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
next time now in doing that

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of course as you can imagine it's important since we want

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
an accurate representation of the original continuous-time signal

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to choose the sampling frequency to very carefully avoid aliasing

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and so in fact in that context

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and in many other contexts alias saying is something

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that we're very eager to avoid however

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
it's also important to understand that alias saying

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
isn't all bad and there are some very specific contexts in which

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
alias saying is very useful and very heavily exploited

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
one example love

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
a very useful context valia saying is when

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
you want to look at things that happen at frequencies

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
that you can't look at for one reason or another and sampling in a leasing is

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
used to map those into lower frequencies

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
one very common example of that is the use of the stroboscopic

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
which was invented by doctor how their chechen

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
at MIT and sometime earlier in fact we had

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
the opportunity to visit doctor Richard ins laboratory at MIT

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and see some examples of this so I'd like to

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
at as a conclusion to this lecture take you

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
on visit to the stroke where and MIT

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in the lecture in discussing aliasing we've stressed

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the fact that in most situations it's something that would like to avoid

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
however right now we're at MIT and stroll Valley

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
as it's called on the way to visit the laboratory

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Mike MIT colleague Professor are alleged

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
where in fact a leasing is an everyday occurrence

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
basically the idea is to follow dead

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
it in fact you wanna make measurements

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
at frequencies that for one reason or another

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
you can't measure their sampling and consequently aliasing

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
can be used to bring those frequencies down into a frequency range that you can

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
measure

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
well professor edgerton alias

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
da kitchen invented the strokes call

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
for exactly that reason and kinda the idea is the fall

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the I essentially is a low pass filter and so there are things that happen

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
at frequencies boat which

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
your I contract and by

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
sampling with light poles sampling in time

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
what in effect you're able to do is sample in such a way

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
that higher frequencies get alias

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
down to lower frequencies then factor I contract

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
so let's take the look inside the where

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and in fact see no aspiration or

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
the scroll and some its effects

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
will be here introduce you to my mighty colleague I kitchen

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
in also by the way he this is a great place for kids of all ages

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and so my daughter just insisted on coming along to

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
also helped out stock need you we could begin with you

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
just saying a little bit about what the strobe is in with some history is

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
steroids ring resemble an increase in a min ly

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
misses them losing on Lampson

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
prices litter control rate planning on

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
school is not a good strategy is going to turn and we're going to look at.

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
motor striving on balance weight

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to set up some rhinos lesions in the spring

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
want to know more bring on the throne

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
by

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
by

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you writer and

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
throbs but just in the frequency the way

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
but corresponds to North influencer little more elusive

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
for the facts thought maybe we could the turn the stroller

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
for a minute noon the but let me

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
point out the by the way there the fact that

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
when looking at this without the strong mind always say essentially

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
our frequencies that are I can attract so you can see the motor

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
turning and

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we can really see other than then with the were we can see the movie the spring

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and so I get your point is that when we put the strobe on

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
who were essentially sampling this and no

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
you brought this stand with a frequency that there the

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Riza with the track in fact

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the I guess if we turn the

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
incandescent light of loon

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the able to really bring out

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
are the alias frequency so now we're what we're looking at in fact are the

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the earliest frequencies the street courses moving a lot faster than we see

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
it in their ranks

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you know that's going on arena

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
30 times second Bruins are

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
thirties and second occurs through the survivors include

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
next move Rohingya figure 8a. saying you don't see that

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
yeah friend

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
well we'll be seeing now is essentially second harmonic that

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
someone okay

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and just do you think you can make this spring dance around a little bit

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
find taking this slow frequency soon as all around

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
okay it's really neat let's turn the lights back on

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
weekend this is Charles president with anything 3 I'm

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
yeah has the third what's interesting now if we look at this and

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
seeking a fifth just rolled off again

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
earth okay noticed just think we look at the spring man although we can see is a

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
blur

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and really can't see because you're right here tracking

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
can see things happening station but he said

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
by the way this was written demonstrated at the World's Fair

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the thickness

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
world because glasses

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
for their Wow a loses all dressed up

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
element using

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
break bring bruises

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
fine but failed I stick with the miners stresses

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
runners or have break

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
bum they work on automobiles

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
their own thoughts on the vibrate but let's

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
earth buy levitra run this for a lot more than half an hour or a liberal

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
name is continues

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
terms

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
thing me maybe we can look at the

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
a couple other things have a about the fam

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
brand the classic buzzed

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that's a good idea makes too much noise

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
ok is to remove that over here that's just an ordinary like the fam

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
has a mark on one plate surgeon

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
identify you can get up to speed

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
know that this looks like a phantom was also demonstrated in the

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
world's fair few years ago yeah kinda been

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
been does a movie

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
quicken awake practicing in to and it was very fan

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
well one like it happened if the reform do

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
MGM and the Peters B Smith

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
wanted he said he won miss royale up

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
custard pie into it not don't know I'm a serious scientists for

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
sizes compromise on a I

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
so we dropped an egg into it in the news UCI's B-movie

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
dropping 0 not known struggle there there was with the

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
high-speed great remove yeah it's okay so

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
so again I guess without this true when we look at its

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
what we're looking at our frequencies it are

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
much higher than the I think following now with the stroke blindness

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
you can see both the alias frequency and you can also see the original frequency

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
because we have the

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
investment line sweats I'm let's

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
turned down the the background lighting and

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
stand then really all that were able to see or the aliasing

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
frequencies stand I guess

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I guess when we see more than one market means that the

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
stay were actually running its and

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
or guns is more and more things the the using

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
lower radiation steroids because the plans aren't exactly the same

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
actually this gives me a chance illustrating other important correlated

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
to the lecture

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll that they could bring them to frequency

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
so that re only get one more scorched

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
missus begins to move this is just one way there now

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
okay so so the way we have now we've essentially alias the fan speed and so

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
is just a little higher than the seeds and now

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
on right at the sea and now if I could and just a little further in fact that

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
looks like the fans turning back hurts

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and if you think that this into context the leasing

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
its it's like this to impulses in the frequency domain

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
crossover in with you get an effective you and was mathematically

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you get a phase reversed in

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
no wasn't so I E I first understood have a leasing

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
with Doc understood why stand with the western movies

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
a everyone's Ryan see the wagon wheels through November go backwards train and

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
there's there the

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
wagon wheels in western movie going backwards yes stressed

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and just see what you see is %um too much weaker on straight up so you get to

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
just see greater frequency of so that's

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
you get to marched

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
u-turn and Justin's governor and you think tourist

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you impressed

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
schoolroom its regular spirits

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
all rights pictures in your honor older adults

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and I rising price revolution I guess another thing is that this demonstrates

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
something that is

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and I heard a long time ago which is its should never use a power so with the

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
fluorescent lights the is arrest like is a little bit of a stroke affecting

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
you could actually can misuse of that standing still make mistakes a

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
strength that you think everything we are doing is a good friend of

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
no I don't think I want to try it out how are you this do you think that's

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
any sores and wounds she knows it's going

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
sproule undergoing closest friends okay let's

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm actually we turn the lights back on again what's

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
their latest see once again is that we can see both the alias frequencies going

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
to you that's

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and we we can also see the higher frequencies because the

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
incandescent lighting its okay maybe we can be no

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
is parents take a look at some other

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
on things and when I guess I'm curious about is the distance you have over

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
their kids

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
doc maybe you can tell us what we have here

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
churros the this to show

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
how you can get motion pictures on a Susan still pictures

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the circle is repeated 12 times

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
why does outer part over mmm on this site

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in part on the other quiet place one time for a revolution on this

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you see the exactly as it is if I skip one picture each time

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
when you get there relative motions

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
mall the object is to show the ball rotating

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
is this where that one depending on mood straw was going faster or slower

00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and the other Uzan this way motion pictures went well

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
100 years school long for photography drew pictures of people

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
different animated features like the run yes great

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is actually the title kinda busy aliasing can be fun conservatism

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
sterling if the speeds

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
or away if you get a lot of different things sorted veterans

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
go through ruin currently reaches speeds

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
reserve a room in the rules it sounds

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
ok and the background blur basically the high frequencies the I can't follow

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and and then we're going to propose and then again we can see

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
frequencies it really is down the nets

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
rookie I ends right now I am one place for revolution sleep

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
see the corner the move is consuming records

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
exactly the reasons there are an increasing frequency

00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
of risk if 100 one server or early get the illusion that diamonds

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
room in fact let's a let's really enhanced solution

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Western the incandescent lights off

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and now now are we seeing really you're the alias frequencies

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
or or do you think this just adds

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
looks like reading recognized through was doing rejoining licensing

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
of is the same rules now lower watching is something also

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
might point out of a for the

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm the lecture for the course is that actually there

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
there really are two sampling frequencies receiving one is this road

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
which is the stroke that you're running the other is the inherent

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Creamery for the TV that's running at 30 frames a second

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and that's won the reasons by the way in dead people watching this

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
on the video worst are in fact seeing

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Flickr or a feeding or modulation between

00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the two on synchronize frame rates runner grievances

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
grow up so we get to of to a room credits

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
of to

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
roaming two runs on each other of

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
of

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you know it senator Reid's learning this

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
soon living room when all your friends

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think would be a good terrific homered problem getting video Kors

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
they have them all sit down and analyze all the frequencies that they're seeing

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and what they're being alias through the evening event

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
it's a good view run the teacher I love you

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
who is great yeah remember these dudes list

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think that a chase a few people away from the courses good

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
cracks and you get you get involved in these offerings

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
rule ruler and what you can do for a KMS roots

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
let's bring you the incandescent lights back again

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
just to remind everybody that in back row this or

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
some some frequencies that are a lot higher than the ones that

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
we begin to get the impression that we're watching just the

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
motor running Frances Bean pattern on

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
long Dhaka have to

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I have to say that there are many people I know they have as much fun in the work

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
as you do

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
home like a man arm quote would but I'd like to

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
do now baby is take a look at one last experiment sure did

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and what I'd like to do is a.m. is go take a look at the

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I guess what sometimes is called the home

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
well not the water graphics for men with thin air the minute dole pillar

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
hydraulic everything that's the 1i was thinking and let's take a look over

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
there

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
okay one just in this Go internal war so

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
your doc this is the what did you got DP

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
HHM bird double peddler hydraulic

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
happening machine Gary okay then it's a.m. so please

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
it looks like continues dream up it is not its

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
pump over there something sixty post second so those owners

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
coming out in spurts %uh so actually again it's

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
it's the the sixty boss is the second year I can follow

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
your eyes so is exactly basically looks like a blur

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ruseler it is a blur writers you learn output stroll on

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
okay grace start so again

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I guess we have this a essentially alias then in

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and again with the incandescent light you can see both sky high frequency

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and the alias frequency its and

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
but see I guess that's with the frequency close to the sea and we can

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
adjusted so that is stop stop bothering me going to go out and then we can

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
actually make it go up

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
scored anybody who is this South

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
yeah effect movie have just just again due to stress this point to the

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
class the the kind of the idea here the face reversal of course

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
you can see it in the time domain Chynoweth you just think about when the

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
flashes of light

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
come but if you think I love kind of these

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
impulses that we have in the frequency domain

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and we're aliasing as we change the sampling frequency what happens is that

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
these impulses crossover

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and what that means is that we get a phase reversal the pending

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
on which faces are associated with

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
which side up the sea so that's kind of the idea the phase reversal

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
okay let's the let's turn the

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
against because it is important thing in between those who got

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
yeah let's let's turn the incandescent light of first and

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
think one thing your so 103 know through this thing you think you can do to get

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
on the other side you're on hand so we can see with

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
when for the UN intervening sleuths

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
water there all the time well on a nosedive it seems to me if we can't we

00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
just the justices

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the that's just go through to next year staff the dots can do it just seeing how

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
come you think your finger in the air

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
fun to try once more its

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I get snyder et that's one thing we can do this

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
well as bring the lights back up and its

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
again just to go stress the point scary RTC

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
there we are at a frequency that it's just a little above the sea

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and we can go back there and in the sea and we can actually get a phase reversal

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and I guess if we do this long enough we get at the at the whole ocean and put it

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
back in

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
we're ever comes from is there in cars in newsrooms gonna run is not running

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
too long by the Rev trailer get here yet to be careful as well as the Moody Blues

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
V

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
surface well I don't know about them but I guess I believe you back its

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
up a little more pressure on three gods monarchy

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Adams girlfriends or service teams

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
going things together Ste

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
we have these machines are all over the place lot of fun

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but that this this is really terrific I i think that

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
the this whole idea of the

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and abusing aliens saying in stroz and

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the kinds of things that did you do with the murder just fantastic in that we

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
really appreciate the chance to

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
come in here and see the demonstration Rose Bowl game ruth's

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
hope you will use it for years the bar over many years to come

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
so is I emphasized that the beginning

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
in what situations aliasing can in fact be very useful

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
also with this demonstrates is that particularly when you have a colleague

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
like da kitchen

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
a leasing and for that matter science in general can be an awful lot of fun

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
by gonna thanks a lot that again and thank you just the name

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
well I have to say that that visit was an awful lot of fun for me and

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
for Justin in fact to for the whole camera crew that was

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
there and hopefully you all have used at some point will also have a chance to

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
visited stroll Valley well

00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
hopefully what we've gone through today gives you

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
a good feeling for the concepts love sampling an alias saying

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and both why it might be useful and why we might want to avoid

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
in the next lecture will continue on

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the discussion of sampling any particular

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
what all be talking about is the interpretation

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
love the reconstruction process not in the frequency domain

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but in a time-domain interpretation specifically associated

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
with the concept %uh interpolating between the samples

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
well then proceed from there too a discussion as i've alluded to

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
in several lectures love what i've referred to as

00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
very heavily exploiting the concept and issues associated with sample

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,000
thank you
