are in

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,690 
for in discussing the sampling theorem

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:60,720 
we saw date for a ban limited signal
which is sampled

17
00:00:60,720 --> 00:01:05,220 
at a frequency that that is at least
twice the highest frequency

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,430 
we can implement exact reconstruction

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,290 
of the original signal by low-pass
filtering

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,960 
an impulse train whose areas are
identical to the sample values

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960 
well essentially this low pass filtering

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,280 
operation provides for us and
interpolation

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,729 
in between the sample values in other
words the output to the low-pass filter

24
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:31,479 
in fact

25
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,520 
is a continuous curve which

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,320 
fits between a sample values some
continuous function

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,210 
now I'm sure that many have you are
familiar with other kinds of

28
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,830 
interpolation that we could potentially
provide

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,790 
in between sample values and in fact in
today's lecture

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,659 
why I would like to do is first the ball

31
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,009 
develop the interpretation

32
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,540 
all the reconstruction as an
interpolation process

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,590 
and then also see how this

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,840 
exact interpolation using a low-pass
filter

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,970 
relates to other kinds of interpolation

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,840 
such as linear interpolation that you
may already be familiar with

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,730 
well to begin let's again review

38
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,299 
what the overall system is for exact
reconstruction

39
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,110 
sampling and reconstruction and so let
me remind you that

40
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,880 
the overall system for sampling and D
sampling a reconstruction is as i

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,030 
indicate here

42
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,310 
the sampling process consists love

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,160 
multiplying by an impulse train and then
the reconstruction process

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,900 
corresponds the processing that impulse
train with

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,410 
a low-pass filter so if the

46
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,590 
spectrum of the original signal

47
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,090 
is what I indicate in this diagram

48
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,580 
then after sampling with an impulse
train

49
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,910 
that spectrum is replicated and

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,900 
this replicated spectrum for
reconstruction

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,290 
is then processed through a low-pass
filter

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,800 
and so in fact if this frequency
response

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,760 
is an idea low-pass filter as i
indicated on the diagram below

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,400 
then multiplying the

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,950 
spectrum of the sample signal by this
extracts 4s

56
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,989 
just the portion all

57
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,010 
the spectrum centered around the origin

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,040 
and what we're left with then is the

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,879 
spectrum finally of the reconstructed
signal

60
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,120 
which for the case of an idea low-pass
filter

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,140 
is exactly equal to the spectrum of the
original signal

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,250 
now that is the

63
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,420 
frequency domain picture

64
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,769 
all the sampling and reconstruction
let's also look at

65
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,530 
basically the same process but let's
examine it now

66
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,560 
in the time domain well in the time
domain

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,970 
what we have is are original signal

68
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,920 
multiply it by an impulse train and

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,970 
this then is the sampled

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,659 
signal or the impulse train whose areas
are equal to the sample values

71
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:27,250 
and because it the fact that this is an
impulse train

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,479 
in fact we can take this term

73
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,620 
inside the summation

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,870 
and of course what counts about except
Ian this expression

75
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,390 
is just as bad use at the sampling
instants

76
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,950 
which are displaced in time by capital T
and so

77
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,330 
to what we can to quietly right is the

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,979 
expression for the impulse train samples
or

79
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,010 
imposed strain of samples as i've
indicated here

80
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,409 
simply an imposed strain whose areas are
the sample bad

81
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:07,029 
now in the reconstruction we process

82
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:12,500 
that impulse train with a low-pass
filter that's the basic notion of the

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,870 
reconstruction

84
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,360 
and so in the time domain be
reconstructed signal

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,270 
is related to the imposed strain of
samples

86
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,279 
through a convolution with the filter
impulse response

87
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,969 
and carrying out this convolution since

88
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:36,839 
this is just the train of pulses in
effect what happens in this convolution

89
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,630 
is dead this impulse response gets

90
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,130 
reproduced at each of the locations 0

91
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,789 
the impulses index a PFD with the
appropriate area

92
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,710 
and finally then in the time domain the
reconstructed signal

93
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,580 
is simply a linear combination

94
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,800 
love shifted versions of the impulse
response

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,089 
with amplitudes Witcher the sample
values

96
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:09,399 
and so this expression in fact and is
our basic

97
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,849 
reconstruction expression in the time
domain

98
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,029 
well in terms of a diagram

99
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,110 
we can think of the original waveform

100
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,140 
as I've shown here and

101
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,339 
the red arrows denote be

102
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,630 
sampled waveform or the train

103
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,979 
love impulses whose amplitude are

104
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,570 
the sample values up the original

105
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,279 
continuous-time signal and

106
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,320 
then I've shown here it what might be a
typical impulse response

107
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,940 
particularly typical in the case where
we're talking about reconstruction with

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,279 
an ideal 0 pass filter

109
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,719 
now what happens in the reconstruction

110
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,930 
is that the convolution love these

111
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,130 
impulses with this impulse response

112
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,500 
means that in the reconstruction

113
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,789 
we superimpose wanted these impulse
responses whatever the filter IPO's

114
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,820 
response happens to be

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,360 
at each of these time instants and in
doing that

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,669 
then those are added up and that gives
us the total reconstructed signal

117
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,719 
of course for the case in which the
filter is an ideal

118
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,880 
low-pass filter then what we know is
that in that case

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,099 
the impulse response is on the form of a
sync function

120
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:43,349 
but generally we may want to consider
other kinds of impulse responses and so

121
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:44,370 
in fact

122
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,380 
the interpolating impulse response

123
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,649 
may have and will have is this
discussion goes along some different

124
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,810 
shapes

125
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,640 
now what I'd like to do is illustrator
demonstrate this process

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,010 
love all affectively doing the
interpolation

127
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,380 
by replacing each of the impulses

128
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,270 
by an appropriate interpolating impulse
response and adding the stop

129
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,709 
and I'd like to do this with a computer
movie that we generated

130
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,839 
and what you're seeing the computer
movie is

131
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,860 
essentially original way for which is a
continuous curve

132
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,430 
and then below that in the movie

133
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,000 
is a train samples

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,659 
and then below that will be the
reconstructed signal and the

135
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,620 
reconstruction

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,599 
will be carried out by showing the
location of the impulse response as it

137
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,959 
moves along in the way form

138
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,440 
and then the reconstructed kurt is
simply the summation of those is that

139
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,380 
impulse response moves along

140
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,640 
so what you'll see then is an impulse
response like this for the particular

141
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,420 
case

142
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,720 
love and idea low-pass filter for the
reconstruction

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,860 
an impulse response like this place

144
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,880 
successively at the locations love

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,410 
these impulses and that is the
convolution process

146
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,459 
and below that then will be the
summation if these

147
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,750 
and the summation up those will then be
the reconstructed signal

148
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,250 
so let's take a look at first of all
that reconstruction

149
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,800 
where the impulse response corresponds
to the impulse response

150
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,960 
have an idea low-pass filter shown here
first

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,480 
is the continuous-time signal which

152
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640 
we want to sample and then reconstruct
using

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,870 
fan limited interpolation or
equivalently

154
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,120 
idea low-pass filtering on the set of
samples

155
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,910 
so the first step then is the sample
this continuous time signal

156
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,840 
and we see here now the set of samples

157
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,570 
and superimposed on the samples are the
original continuous 5 signal

158
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,410 
to focus on the fact that those are
samples are the top curve

159
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,530 
let's now remove the continuous-time

160
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,210 
envelope with the samples and it's this
set of samples that we then want to use

161
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,480 
for the reconstruction

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,890 
the reconstruction process interpreted
as interpolation

163
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,960 
consists of replacing each sample with a
sin x over X function

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,720 
and so let's first consider the sample

165
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,310 
at equal 0 and here is the

166
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,960 
interpolating sin x over X function
Associated

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,050 
with that sample now the more general

168
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,330 
process then is to

169
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,880 
place a sin x over expulsion at the time
location of each sample and superimpose

170
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,930 
those

171
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,720 
let's begin that process at the
left-hand and

172
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,540 
the set of samples and in the bottom
curve

173
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,850 
will build up the reconstruction as
those sin x over X functions

174
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,320 
are added together so we begin with the
left hand sample and we see their the

175
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,890 
sin x over X function

176
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,890 
on the bottom curve then is the first
step in the reconstruction

177
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,980 
we now have the sin x over X function
associated with the second sample

178
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,880 
let's add that in now we move on

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,990 
to the third sample and that sin x over
X function

180
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,990 
is added in

181
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,220 
continuing on the next

182
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,830 
sample generates a sin x over X function

183
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,210 
which is superimposed on the result that
we've accumulated

184
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,400 
so far and now let's just

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,520 
speed up the process will move on to the
fifth sample

186
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,720 
add that in the sect sample add that in

187
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,320 
and continue on through the set of
samples and

188
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,840 
keep in mind the fact that basically
what we're doing explicitly here

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,240 
is the convolution up the impulse train
with a sin x over X function

190
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,540 
and because the set of samples that we
started with

191
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,690 
where samples haven't exactly been
limited function

192
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,050 
what we are reconstructing exactly

193
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,440 
is the original continuous-time signal

194
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,440 
that we have on the top trace

195
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,610 
okay so that then

196
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,070 
kinda gives you the picture above doing

197
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,460 
interpolation by replacing the impulses
by a continuous curve and that's the way

198
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,280 
we're fitting

199
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,680 
a continuous curve to the original

200
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,260 
impulse train and let me stress

201
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,640 
that this reconstruction process

202
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,840 
by putting the impulses through

203
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,070 
a filter the reconstruction process

204
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,520 
follows this relationship whether or not

205
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,380 
this impulse response in fact
corresponds to an ideal ok pass filter

206
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,080 
what this expression always says is dead
reconstructing this way

207
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,550 
corresponds to replacing the impulses

208
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,750 
by a shift in impulse response with an
effort to

209
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,750 
dead is an amplitude corresponding to
the sample value now

210
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,690 
be kinda reconstruction dead we've just
talked about and the ideal

211
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,860 
reconstruction

212
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,060 
is often referred to as band limited

213
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,410 
interpolation because for interpolating
in between the samples

214
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,720 
by making the assumption that the
signals ban limited

215
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,140 
and using the impulse response for an
idea low-pass filter

216
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,250 
which has a cutoff frequency consistent
with

217
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,410 
the soon band with for the signal so if
we look

218
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,020 
here for example at the impulse train

219
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,860 
then in the demonstration that you just
saw

220
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,360 
we built up the reconstructed curve by
replacing each of these impulses

221
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,630 
with the sync function and the some of
those

222
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,140 
built up the reconstruct the curve well

223
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,480 
there are lots of other kinds of
interpolation

224
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,830 
dead are perhaps maybe not as exact

225
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,680 
by often easier to implement and what
I'd like to do is focus our attention on

226
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,640 
to appease

227
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,470 
one of these the first that I want to
mention is what's referred to as a

228
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,860 
zero-order hold

229
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,930 
where in effect we do the interpolation
in between these

230
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,950 
sample values by simply holding the
sample value

231
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,200 
until the next sampling instant and the
reconstruction

232
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,280 
that we end up with in that that case
will look something like this:

233
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,840 
it's a staircase or boxcar kinda
function

234
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,520 
where we've simply held the sample value

235
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,400 
until the next sampling instant and then
replaced by that value held until the

236
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,970 
next sampling instant et cetera

237
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,310 
now that's one kinda interpolation

238
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,740 
another kinda very common interpolation
is

239
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,760 
what's referred to as linear
interpolation we simply fit

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,130 
a straight line between the sample
values and in that case

241
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,660 
the cut be type reconstruction that we
would get

242
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,300 
would look something like I indicate
here where we take a sample value

243
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,860 
and the following sample value and
simply fit interpolated curve between

244
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,610 
them

245
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,060 
which is a straight line now

246
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,340 
interestingly in fact both the
zero-order hold

247
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,780 
and the linear interpolation which is

248
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,890 
often referred to as a first-order hold
can also

249
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,030 
be either implemented or interpreted
both implemented interpreted

250
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,510 
in the context of the equation that we
just develop

251
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,580 
in particular the processing I'll the

252
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,140 
imposed strain of samples by

253
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,600 
a linear time-invariant filter
specifically

254
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,050 
if we consider a

255
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,550 
system where the impulse response

256
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,450 
is a rectangular function

257
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,530 
then in fact if

258
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,000 
we processed the train if samples

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,220 
through a filter with this impulse
response exactly

260
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,410 
the reconstruction that we would get is
what I've shown here

261
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,670 
alternatively if we chose an impulse
response

262
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,820 
which was a triangular

263
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,430 
impulse response then

264
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,470 
what in effect happens is that each of
these impulses

265
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,690 
activates this triangle

266
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,010 
and when we add up those triangles at
successive locations in fact

267
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,710 
what we generate is this linear
interpolation

268
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,430 
so what this says in fact is dead

269
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,520 
either a zero-order hold

270
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,670 
which holds the value or linear
interpolation

271
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,380 
can likewise be interpreted as a process

272
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,100 
love convolved thing the impulse trainer
samples

273
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,370 
with inappropriate filter impulse
response

274
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,470 
well what I'd like to do is demonstrate

275
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,870 
as we did with the ban limit
interpolation or

276
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,100 
these sink interpolation is sometimes
called interplay with a sin x over axe

277
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,330 
let me now show the process first the
ball

278
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,670 
where we have a zero-order hold

279
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,280 
as corresponding to this impulse
response

280
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,770 
in which case we'll see basically the
same process as we saw your

281
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,370 
in the computer-generated movie
previously

282
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,800 
but now rather than a sync function
replacing

283
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,770 
each of these impulses will have a
rectangular function

284
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,100 
that will generate then are
approximation which is a zero-order hold

285
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,480 
and following that will do exactly the
same thing with the same way form

286
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,990 
using a first-order hold or a triangular
impulse response

287
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,070 
in which case well we'll see again is
that as the triangle moves along here

288
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,440 
and we build up the running some or the
convolution

289
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,880 
then will in fact fit the original curve

290
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,580 
with a linear curve soul now let's

291
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,970 
again look at that remembering that at
the top will see

292
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,800 
the original continuous curve exactly
the one that we had before

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,070 
below it the set of samples together
with

294
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,220 
the impulse response moving along and
then finally below that

295
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,320 
the accumulation of those impulse
responses work with only

296
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,070 
the convolution or equivalent Lee the
reconstruction

297
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,680 
so we have the same continuous-time
signal that we use previously with

298
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,810 
ban limited interpolation and in this
case

299
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,040 
now we want to sample and then
interpolate first for the zero-order

300
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,190 
hold

301
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,530 
and then with the first-order whole so
the first step then

302
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,180 
is the sample the continuous-time signal

303
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,360 
and we show here at the set of samples
once again

304
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,350 
superimposed on which we have the
continuous-time signal

305
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,510 
which of course is exactly the same
curve as

306
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,600 
we have in the top well let's

307
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,750 
remove that envelope so that we focus
attention

308
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,800 
on the samples that were using to
interpolate

309
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,830 
any interpolation process consists love
replacing each sample

310
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,370 
by a rectangular signal

311
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,570 
whose amplitude is equal to the sample
size

312
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,490 
so let's put one first of all at equal 0
Associated

313
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,550 
with that sample

314
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,360 
and that then would be the interpolating
rectangle associated with the sample at

315
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360 
equal 0

316
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,690 
now to build up the interpolation what
will have is one of those that each

317
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,230 
sample time and those are

318
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,270 
added together will start that process
as we did before

319
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,610 
at the left hand and that the set of
samples

320
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,250 
and build the interpolating signal on
the bottom so

321
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,700 
with the left hand sample we have first

322
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,490 
the rectangle associated with that that
shown

323
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,020 
now on the bottom curve we now

324
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,330 
have a senator plating rectangle with
the second

325
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,200 
sample that gets headed into the bottom
curve

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,910 
similarly and interpolating rectangle
for the zero-order hold

327
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,450 
with the third sample we had bad in to
the bottom curve

328
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,930 
and as we proceed we're building a
staircase approximation

329
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,630 
on to the next sample that gets added in

330
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,750 
as we see the air and now lets speed up
the process

331
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,840 
and we'll see the staircase
approximation

332
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,429 
building up and notice in this case

333
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,480 
as in the previous case that what we're
basically watching dynamically

334
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,400 
is the convolution love the imposed
strain of samples

335
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,900 
with the impulse response the
interpolating filter

336
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,820 
which in this particular case is just a
rectangular Paul's

337
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,320 
and so this staircase approximation that
we're generating

338
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,510 
is the zero-order hold interpolation

339
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,740 
between the samples I love the

340
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,740 
ban limited signal which is at the top

341
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,580 
now let's do the same thing with the
first-order whole so in this case

342
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,060 
we want to interpolate using a
triangular impulse response

343
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,520 
rather than the sin x over X or
rectangular impulse responses that we

344
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,980 
showed previously

345
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,380 
so first let's say with the sample it
equals 0

346
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,290 
we would replace that with a triangular

347
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,670 
interpolating function and more
generally

348
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,540 
each in polls or sample is replaced with
a triangular

349
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,560 
interpolating function of the height
equal to the sample height

350
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,670 
and these are superposed to generate the
linear interpolation

351
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,970 
will begin this process with the
leftmost

352
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,870 
sample and will build the superposition

353
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,040 
below and the bottom curve so here

354
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,390 
is the interpolating triangle for the

355
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,760 
leftmost sample and now it's reproduced
below

356
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,030 
with the second sample we have an
interpolating triangle which is added

357
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,179 
into the bottom

358
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,679 
curve and now on to the third sample

359
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,790 
and again that interpolating triangle
will be added onto

360
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,530 
the curve that we've developed so far

361
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,290 
and now on to the next sample

362
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,490 
we had that in there will speed up the
process

363
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,810 
and as we proceed through

364
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,210 
we are building basically a linear
interpolation

365
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,650 
in between the sample points

366
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,910 
a sexually corresponding to if one wants
to think of it this way connecting the

367
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,700 
dots

368
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,390 
and what you're watching once again is
essentially the convolution process

369
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,470 
involving the impulse train with the
impulse response

370
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,310 
the interpolating filter and what we're
generating then

371
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,720 
is a linear approximation

372
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,720 
to the fam limited continuous-time curve
at the top

373
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,980 
okay so what we have then is

374
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,280 
several other kinds of interpolation
which

375
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,929 
fit within the same context as

376
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,490 
exact ban limit interpolation one being

377
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,130 
interpolation in the time domain with an
impulse response which is a rectangle

378
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,890 
the second being interpolation in the
time domain

379
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,520 
with an impulse response which is a
triangle

380
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,690 
and in fact its interesting to also

381
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,679 
look at the relationship between at and
ban limit interpolation

382
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,250 
look at it specifically in the frequency
domain

383
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,450 
well in the frequency-domain

384
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,290 
what we know of course is dead for exact
interpolation

385
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,770 
what we want as our interpolating filter
is an ideal Lopez filter

386
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,390 
now keep in mind by the way that an idea
low-pass filter is an abstraction is a

387
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,820 
stress several times in the past an idea
low-pass filter

388
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,470 
is a9 causal filter and in fact infinite
extent which is

389
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,710 
one of the reasons why in any case we
would you some approximation to it

390
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,000 
but here what we have is the

391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,700 
exact interpolating filter

392
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,000 
and that corresponds to an ideal 0 pass
filter

393
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,020 
if instead we carried out the
interpolation

394
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,570 
using the zero-order hold the zero-order
hold has a

395
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,380 
rectangular impulse response and that
means in the frequency domain

396
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,880 
its frequency response is of the form
love

397
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,890 
a sync function or sin x over iraq's

398
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,890 
and so this in fact when we're doing the
reconstruction

399
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,210 
with a zero-order hold is The Associated
frequency response

400
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:46,060 
now notice that it does some approximate
Lopez filtering but of course

401
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,320 
it has significant it permits
significant energy

402
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,830 
outside the pass band at the filter

403
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,320 
well instead the zero-order hold if we
use the first-order hold corresponding

404
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,070 
to the triangular impulse response

405
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,050 
in that case then in the frequency
domain The Associated

406
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,070 
frequency response would be the forty a
transformer the triangle

407
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,190 
and the Fourier transform a triangle is
a sin squared

408
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,310 
X over X where'd kinda function

409
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,310 
and so in that case what we would have

410
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,850 
for the frequency response associated
with the first-order hold

411
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,730 
is a frequency response as I show here

412
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:33,300 
and the fact dead that there's somewhat
more attenuation

413
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,370 
outside the pass band at the ideal
filter

414
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,260 
is what suggests in fact dead the
first-order hold or linear interpolation

415
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,270 
gives us a somewhat smoother
approximation to the original

416
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,620 
signal then the zero-order hold does

417
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,950 
and so in fact just to compare these two

418
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,140 
we can see that here is

419
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,260 
the ideal filter here is

420
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,490 
the zero-order hold corresponding to

421
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,800 
generating a boxcar kinda reconstruction

422
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:12,480 
and here is the first order hold
corresponding to a linear interpolation

423
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,690 
now in fact in many sampling systems

424
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,600 
in any sampling system really we need to
use some approximation

425
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,490 
to the low-pass filter and very often in
fact

426
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,810 
what is done in many sampling systems is
the first to use

427
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,919 
just a zero-order hold and then follow
the zero-order hold

428
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,840 
with some additional 0 pass filtering

429
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,240 
well to illustrate some with these ideas

430
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,560 
and the notion love doing reconstruction

431
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,530 
with a zero-order hold a first-order
hold and then in fact

432
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,030 
are ending to that some additional 0
pass filtering

433
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,010 
what I'd like to do is is demonstrator
illustrate

434
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,250 
sampling and interpolation in the
context love some images

435
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,110 
image of course is a two-dimensional
signal the

436
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,610 
the independent variables are spatial
variables not time variables

437
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,990 
and of course we can sample in both or
the spatial dimensions both in X&Y

438
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,820 
and were chosen as so

439
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,910 
a possibly appropriate choice for

440
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:29,340 
an image is again our friend and
colleague JBJ 48

441
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,800 
so let's begin with the original image
which we then

442
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,660 
want to sample and reconstruct and a
sampling is done by

443
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,440 
effectively multiplying by appalls both
horizontally and vertically

444
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,560 
the sample picture is then the next one

445
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,179 
that I show and as you can see this
corresponds in effect

446
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,929 
to extracting small brightness elements
I did the original image in fact

447
00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:01,080 
let's look in a little closer and what
you can see essentially is that

448
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,419 
well we have of course tonight impulses
spatially but

449
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,650 
small spatial pillars dead

450
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,440 
implement the sampling for us okay now

451
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,310 
going back to the original sample
picture

452
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,460 
we know that a picture can be
reconstructed by low-pass filtering from

453
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,000 
the samples and in fact

454
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,490 
we can do that optically in this case by
simply d focusing the camera

455
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,040 
and when we do that what happens is that
we smear out the picture

456
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,639 
or affectively convolved the impulses
with the point spread function of the

457
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,630 
optical system

458
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,310 
an this then is not too bad a
reconstruction

459
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:46,409 
so thats a an approximate reconstruction
and focusing back now

460
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:53,409 
what we have again is the sample picture

461
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,240 
now these images are in fact a can often
of

462
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,260 
a computer display and a common
procedure in

463
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,320 
computer-generated are displayed image
is is in fact

464
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,560 
the use of a zero-order hold and if the
sampling rate is high enough

465
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,240 
then that actually works reasonably well
so now

466
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,600 
let's look at the result of applying a
zero-order hold

467
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,679 
to the sampled image that I

468
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,580 
just showed

469
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,149 
the zero-order hold corresponds to
replacing the impulses by

470
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:33,120 
rectangles and you can see that what
that generates

471
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,530 
is a mosaic affect as you would

472
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,929 
expect and in fact let's going a little
closer and

473
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,770 
emphasize the mosaic affect you can see
that essentially where they were

474
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,610 
impulses previously

475
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,860 
there are now rectangles with those
brightness values

476
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,710 
a very common procedure with
computer-generated images is the first

477
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,800 
20 order holders we've done here

478
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,179 
and then follow that with some
additional ok pass filtering and in fact

479
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,929 
we can do that low pass filtering now
again by D focusing the camera

480
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:11,060 
and you can't begin to see

481
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,260 
dead with the zero-order all plus the
low-pass filtering the reconstruction is

482
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,230 
not that bad

483
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,550 
well let's go back to the full

484
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,909 
image with the zero-order hold

485
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,020 
and again now the effective low pass
filter I will be

486
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,280 
somewhat better and let's tee focus
again year

487
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,550 
and you can begin to see that this is

488
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,720 
a reasonable reconstruction with the
mosaic

489
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,050 
in fact with this back in focus you can

490
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,139 
apply your own low-pass filtering to it
either by squinting

491
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:52,960 
or if you have the right or wrong kind
of my classes either taking them off for

492
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,790 
putting them on

493
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,540 
now in addition to the zero-order hold
weekend of course apply a first-order

494
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,210 
hold and that would

495
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,280 
correspond to replacing the impulses
instead of with rectangles as we have

496
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,120 
here

497
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,510 
replacing them with triangles an

498
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,860 
so now let's take a look at the result
all a first-order hold applied to the

499
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,399 
original samples

500
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,860 
and you can see now that the
reconstruction is somewhat smoother

501
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,720 
because the fact that we're using an
impulse response

502
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,870 
that somewhat smoother or a
corresponding frequency response that

503
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,320 
has a sharper cut off

504
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,139 
i emphasize again that this is a
somewhat low pass filtered version of

505
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,649 
the original because

506
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,700 
we have under sampled some what
spatially

507
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:46,700 
to bring out the point that I want to
illustrate

508
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,310 
okay to emphasize these effects

509
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,720 
even more what I'd like to do is go
through

510
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,899 
basically the same sequence again but in
this case what we'll do

511
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:02,649 
is double the sample spacing both
horizontal horizontally and vertically

512
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,020 
this of course means there will be even
more highly under sampled been

513
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,440 
in the ones that I preview show
previously showed and so the result of

514
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,030 
the reconstructions with some low pass
filtering

515
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,919 
will be a much more low-pass filtered
image

516
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,419 
so we now have the sample picture but
I've now under sampled considerably

517
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,120 
more and you can see the effect of the
sampling

518
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,649 
and if we now apply is zero-order hold

519
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:35,790 
to this picture we will again get a
mosaic and lets

520
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,030 
look at that and that mosaic of course
looks

521
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,860 
even block here than the original and
again emphasizes the fact that the

522
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,110 
zero-order hold

523
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,070 
simply corresponds to filling in squares
or replacing the impulses

524
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,540 
by squares with the corresponding
brightness

525
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,830 
values finally if we instead of a
zero-order hold

526
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,580 
use a first-order hold corresponding to
two-dimensional triangles in places

527
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,050 
in place at these original blocks what
we get is

528
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,810 
the next image and that again is a
smoother reconstruction consistent with

529
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,010 
the fact that the triangles are smoother
than the rectangles

530
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,210 
again i emphasize that this looks so
highly low-pass filtered

531
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,010 
because of the fact that we've under
sampled so severely

532
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:31,120 
to essentially emphasize the effect

533
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,220 
as I mentioned the images that we

534
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,370 
just looked at were taken from a
computer although

535
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,800 
because the original images were
continuous-time

536
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,210 
images or more specifically continuous
space that is the independent variable

537
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,830 
is a spatial variable

538
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,560 
now computer processing

539
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,860 
love signals pictures speech or whatever
the signals are

540
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,930 
is very important and useful because

541
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,200 
it offers a lot of flexibility and in
fact the kinds of things that I showed

542
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,420 
these pictures

543
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,920 
would have been very hard to do without

544
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,600 
in fact doing computer processing

545
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,860 
well in computer processing %uh any kind
of signal

546
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,800 
basically what's required is dead

547
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,060 
we do the processing in the context of
discrete-time signals and discrete-time

548
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,030 
processing

549
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,300 
because it the fact dead a computer is
run off the clock

550
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,670 
and essentially things happen in the
computer

551
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:39,430 
in a as a sequence of numbers and as a
sequence of events

552
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,430 
well it turns out dead the sampling
theorem in fact as i've indicated

553
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,850 
previously

554
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,250 
provides us with a very nice mechanism

555
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,140 
for converting are continuous-time
signals

556
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,530 
into discrete-time signals for example
for computer processing

557
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,180 
or in fact if it's not a computer for
some other kind of discrete-time or

558
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,870 
perhaps digital processing

559
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,970 
well the basic idea as i've indicated
previously

560
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,150 
is to carry out discreet I processing

561
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,610 
of continuous-time signals by

562
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,200 
first converting the continuous-time
signal

563
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,640 
to a discrete-time signal carry out

564
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,420 
the appropriate discrete-time processing

565
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,820 
love the discrete-time signal and then
after we're done with that process

566
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,510 
saying

567
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,030 
converting from the discrete-time
sequence

568
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,690 
back to a continuous-time signal

569
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:48,000 
corresponding to the output that we have
here

570
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,570 
well in the remainder this lecture what
I'd like to analyze

571
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,730 
is the first step in that process namely
the conversion

572
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,380 
from a continuous-time signal to a
discrete-time signal

573
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,720 
and understand how the

574
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,910 
to relate both in the time domain in the
frequency domain

575
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,350 
and in the next lecture will be
analyzing and demonstrating

576
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,490 
the overall system including some
intermediate processing

577
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,600 
so be first step in the process

578
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,520 
is the conversion from a continuous-time
signal

579
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,940 
to a discrete-time signal and that can
be thought of as a process that involves

580
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:33,050 
two steps although in practical terms it
may not be implemented specifically

581
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,650 
as these two steps the two steps are

582
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,090 
to first convert from the
continuous-time

583
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,350 
for continuous-time continuous signal

584
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:49,490 
to an impulse train through a sampling
process

585
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,880 
and then to convert

586
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,660 
that impulse train to a discrete-time
sequence

587
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,420 
and the discrete-time sequence exit then

588
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,700 
is simply then a sequence a bad news

589
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,460 
which are the samples all the
continuous-time signal

590
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,270 
and as we'll see as we walk through this
basically this step

591
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,940 
going from the impulse train to the
sequence

592
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,490 
corresponds principally to worry
labeling staff where

593
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,020 
we pic of the impulse bad news

594
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,870 
and use those as the sequence values

595
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,320 
up for the discrete-time signal so

596
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,210 
what I'd like to do as a first step in
understanding this process

597
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:42,580 
is to analyze it in particular with our
attention focused on trying to

598
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,880 
understand

599
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,930 
what the relationship is in the
frequency domain

600
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,120 
between the discrete-time Fourier
transform

601
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,970 
love the sequence discrete-time signal

602
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,380 
and the continuous-time 48 transform

603
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,520 
love the original on sampled and then

604
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,440 
the sampled signal so let's go through
that

605
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,690 
and in particular

606
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,330 
what we have is a process where the
continuous-time signal

607
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,980 
is of course modulator multiplied

608
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,410 
by an impulse train and that gives us
then

609
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,480 
another continuous-time signal we're
still in the continuous time domain

610
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,110 
it gives us another continuous-time
signal which is an impulse train

611
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,160 
and in fact we've gone through this
analysis

612
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,670 
previously and what we have is

613
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:39,120 
this multiplication or taking this term
inside

614
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,200 
the summation and recognizing that the
impulse train

615
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,920 
is is simply an impulse train

616
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,050 
with areas above the impulses which

617
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,520 
are the samples above the
continuous-time function

618
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,430 
we can then carry out the analysis in
the frequency domain

619
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,430 
now in the time domain we have a
multiplication process so in the

620
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,700 
frequency domain

621
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,040 
we have a convolution above the Fourier
transform

622
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,020 
love the continuous-time signal the
original signal

623
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,610 
and the Fourier transform of the impulse
train which is itself an impulse train

624
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,330 
so in the frequency domain then the 48
transform

625
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,100 
of the sampled signal which is an
impulse train

626
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,220 
is the convolution %uh the Fourier
transform up the sampling

627
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:36,330 
function PFT and the Fourier transform
of the sampled signal

628
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,260 
since the sampling signal is a periodic
imposed strain

629
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,420 
its Fourier transform is an impulse
train

630
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,060 
and consequently carrying out this
convolution

631
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,430 
in effect says that this for EA
transform

632
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:57,580 
simply gets replicated at each of the
locations of these impulses

633
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,619 
and finally what we end up with an

634
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,400 
is a 48 transform after

635
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,440 
the sampling process which is

636
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,100 
the original for EA transform love the
continuous

637
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,580 
signal but and it to itself

638
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,600 
shifted by integer multiples

639
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,900 
above the sampling frequency and so this
is the basic equation then

640
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,040 
that tells us in the frequency domain
what happens

641
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,490 
through the first part all this two-step
process

642
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,060 
now I emphasize that is a two-step
process the first process

643
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,510 
is sampling where we're still
essentially

644
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,290 
in the continuous-time world the next
step

645
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,740 
is essentially a relabeling process

646
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,650 
where we convert that impulse train
simply to a sequence

647
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,770 
so let's look at the next step

648
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,750 
the next step is to take the impulse
train and converted

649
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,710 
through a process to sequence

650
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,790 
and the sequence values are simply then

651
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,550 
samples 0 the original continuous signal

652
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,670 
and so now we

653
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,450 
can analyze this and what we want to
relate

654
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,720 
is the discrete-time Fourier transform

655
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,730 
love this and the continuous 540 a
transformer

656
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,570 
this or in fact that continues type for
a transformer affects up to you

657
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,950 
safety okay

658
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,440 
well we have the imposed strain

659
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,050 
and its Fourier transform we can

660
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,010 
get by simply evaluating for EA
transform

661
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,430 
and since the Fourier transform love
this

662
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:50,070 
since this corresponds to an impulse
train the 48 transformed by the time we

663
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,960 
change them something in it rolls

664
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,840 
will then have this in paul's replace

665
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,850 
524 e a transformer the shift in polls

666
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,810 
which is this exponential factor so this
expression

667
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,050 
is before a transformer the impulse
train

668
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,430 
the continuous time Fourier transform
and alternatively

669
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,730 
we can look at the Fourier transform all

670
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,790 
the sequence and this of course is

671
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,000 
a discrete-time Fourier transform

672
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,030 
so we have the continuous time Fourier
transform the imposed strain

673
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,369 
we have the discrete-time Fourier
transform the sequence

674
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:34,040 
and now we want to look at how those to
relate

675
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,970 
well it pretty much falls out of just
comparing these two summations

676
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,660 
in particular this term and this term

677
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,440 
are identical that's just the relabeling

678
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,070 
Nov all what the sequence values are

679
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,080 
and notice that when we compare these
exponential factors

680
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:02,140 
they're identical as long as we
associate capital Omega

681
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,490 
with little or may get times capital T
in other words

682
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,280 
if we were to replace here capital may
go by a little Omega

683
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,910 
times capital T and replace exhibition

684
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,200 
by excessive see a venti in this
expression

685
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,200 
would be identical to this expression

686
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,280 
so in fact these two are equal

687
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,510 
where a relabeling or with the
transformation between small Megan

688
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,960 
capital make

689
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,060 
and so in fact then the relationship
that we have

690
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,040 
is that the discrete-time Fourier
transform are

691
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,160 
the sequence of samples

692
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,060 
is equal to the continuous time Fourier
transform

693
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,360 
all the impulse strain of samples

694
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,890 
where we associate the continuous-time
frequency variable

695
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,500 
and the discrete-time pic script
frequency variable through

696
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,110 
a frequency scaling as i indicate here
or said another way

697
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:07,220 
the discrete-time spectrum is the
continuous I spectrum of the samples

698
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,880 
with capital mate with small Omega
replaced by capital Omega

699
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,990 
divided by capital T

700
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,630 
fight so we have then this two-step
process

701
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,980 
the first step is taking the
continuous-time signal

702
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,140 
sampling with it sampling it with an
impulse train

703
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,600 
in the frequency domain that corresponds
to

704
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,880 
replicating the four EA transform

705
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,550 
all the original continuous-time signals

706
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,920 
the second step is relabeling Matt

707
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,730 
in effect turning it into a sequence and
what that does in the frequency domain

708
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,590 
is provide us

709
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,820 
with a rescaling if the frequency axis
or as we'll see

710
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,960 
a frequency normalization which is
associated with the corresponding time

711
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,060 
normalization

712
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,600 
in the time domain well let's look at

713
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,350 
those statements a little more
specifically

714
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:09,760 
when I show here it is the original
continuous-time signal

715
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,869 
and then below it is

716
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,940 
the sampled signal and these two

717
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,750 
are signals in the continuous-time
domain

718
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,430 
now what is the conversion from this
impulse train

719
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,210 
to a sequence well it simply taking

720
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,150 
these in polls areas are bad news the
sample values

721
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,220 
and relabeling them in effect is a show
below

722
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:41,839 
relabeling them as sequence values

723
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,650 
and essentially I'm now replacing

724
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:50,680 
the impulse by the designation of a
sequence value

725
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,130 
that's one step but the other important
step to focus on

726
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,740 
is dead whereas in the impulse trainees
impulses are spaced

727
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,780 
by integer multiples of the sampling
period capital T

728
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,000 
in the sequence of course because if the
way that we

729
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,670 
label sequences these are always space
by

730
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,750 
simply integer multiples of 1

731
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,839 
so in effect you could say that the step
in going from here

732
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,220 
to hear corresponds to normalizing out
in the time domain

733
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,549 
the sampling period capital T

734
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:32,490 
to stress that another way if the
sampling period were doubled

735
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:38,260 
so there'd in this picture this spacing
stretched out by a factor of two

736
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,630 
nevertheless in the discrete-time

737
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,720 
for the discrete-time signal the spacing
would remain as one

738
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,170 
and essentially its the

739
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,349 
envelope of those sequence values

740
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:56,460 
that would then get contracts compressed
in time

741
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,880 
so you can think all the step in going
from the impulse train to the samples

742
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,710 
as a sexually a time normalization

743
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,059 
now let's look at this in the frequency
domain in the frequency domain

744
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:14,089 
what we have is the Fourier transform of
our original continuous

745
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:18,950 
signal after sampling with an impulse
train

746
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,380 
this spectrum retains its shape

747
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,430 
him but is replicated at integer
multiples of the sampling frequency to

748
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,180 
pry over capital T

749
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,359 
as i indicated here now

750
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,940 
we know that a discrete-time spectrum

751
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,559 
must be periodic and frequency with a
period of two pi

752
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,599 
here we have the periodicity but it's
not periodic with period have to pry

753
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,690 
its periodic with period which is equal
to the sampling frequency

754
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,150 
however in converting from the samples

755
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,619 
to the sequence values and we go through
another step

756
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,160 
what the other step the other step is a
time normalization

757
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,900 
where we take the impulses which your
space by the sampling period

758
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,540 
and we rescale at essentially in the
time domain

759
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,049 
to a space in which is unity so we're
dividing out

760
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:17,190 
in the time domain by a

761
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,559 
by a factor which is

762
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,599 
equal to the sampling period well

763
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,240 
dividing out in the time domain by

764
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,230 
capital T would correspond to

765
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:36,490 
multiplying in the frequency domain the
frequency axis by capital T and indeed

766
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,470 
what happens is dead in going from the
imposed strain

767
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,680 
to the sequence values we now rescale

768
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,339 
this axis so that in fact

769
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:51,579 
the axis gets stretched by capital T

770
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:56,410 
and the frequency which corresponded to
2pi over capital T

771
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,990 
now gets re normalized 22 part

772
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:05,730 
so just looking at this again and
perhaps with the overall picture

773
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,690 
in the time domain we've gone from a
continuous curve

774
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:15,790 
two samples relabel those and in effect
implemented a time normalization

775
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,150 
correspondingly in the frequency domain
we

776
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,609 
have replicated the spectrum through the
initial sampling process

777
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:27,170 
and then rescale the frequency axis

778
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,270 
so that in fact now this periodicity

779
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:34,380 
corresponds to a periodicity here which
is to Popeye

780
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,880 
and here which is the sampling frequency

781
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,030 
so very often in fact and will be doing
this next time

782
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,240 
very often when you think

783
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,460 
love continuous-time signals which have
been converted to discrete-time signals

784
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,530 
when you look at the discrete-time
frequency axis

785
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,869 
the frequency to pie is Associated

786
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,900 
with the sampling frequency

787
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,520 
as it will it was applied to the
original continuous-time signals

788
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,200 
now as i indicated what will want to go
on to from here

789
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,660 
is understanding I'll

790
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,950 
what happens when we take a
continuous-time signal

791
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,400 
converted to a discrete-time signal as I
just going through

792
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,970 
do some discreet I processing with the
linear time-invariant system

793
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,530 
and then carry that back into the
continuous-time world

794
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,430 
that is a procedure that will go through
and

795
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,750 
analyze and in fact illustrate in some
detail

796
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,170 
next time in preparation for that

797
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,230 
what I would be eager to encourage you
to do

798
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:47,569 
using the study guide and in reviewing
this lecture

799
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:51,760 
is to begin the next lecture

800
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,329 
with a careful and thorough
understanding love

801
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,650 
the arguments that I just going through
in particular

802
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:03,250 
understanding the process that's
involved in going from a continuous-time

803
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,180 
signal

804
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,359 
through sampling to a discrete-time
signal

805
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:12,319 
and what that means in the frequency
domain interns to taking the original

806
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,770 
spectrum

807
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,250 
replicating it because if the sampling
process

808
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,359 
and then sry scaling that so that

809
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:24,510 
the periodicity gets rescaled so that
its periodic

810
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,900 
with a period of two part so will
continue with that next time focusing

811
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,450 
now

812
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,660 
on the subsequent steps

813
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,869 
in the process thank you
