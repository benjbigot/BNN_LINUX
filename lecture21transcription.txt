040310~007000~the new the
053090~006469~last time we introduce the La Paz transform
059559~005170~as a generalization the Fourier transform and just as a reminder
064729~003911~the lacrosse transform expression as we developed it
068640~003690~is this integral very much
072330~003220~similar to the Fourier transform integral
075550~005170~except with more general complex variable and in fact we
080720~003370~developed and talked about the relationship between the apostrophe is
084090~001850~forming a 48 transform
085940~003510~in particular the apostrophe s form
089450~003110~where the Posterous for variable ass
092560~003820~purely imaginary in fact reduces
096380~003180~to the 48 transform or
099560~005140~more generally with the process for variable as a complex number
104700~003150~the a-plus transform is
107850~004390~the Fourier transform love the corresponding time
112240~003700~function with an exponential weighting and
115940~003140~also as you should recall the
119080~003539~exponential weighting introduce the notion that
122619~004301~the repost transform may converge for some bad use
126920~003089~Sigma and perhaps not for other values Sigma
130009~003631~so associated with the look lost transform
133640~004550~was what we refer to as the region of convergence
138190~003909~now just says
142099~003891~with the Fourier transform there are a number of properties
145990~003320~the applause transform that are extremely useful
149310~004370~in describing and analyzing signals and systems
153680~004029~for example one other properties
157709~004331~that we in fact took advantage out in our discussion last time
162040~003710~was the limit linearity property which says
165750~005180~in essence that they'll a-plus transform love the linear combination
170930~003510~up to time functions is the same
174440~003960~linear combination love the associated with boss transforms
178400~006350~also there is a very important and useful property which tells us
184750~003620~how the derivative overtime function
188370~003760~or rather the applause transformer the derivative
192130~003700~is related to the low-priced transform in particular
195830~005610~the a-plus transformer the derivative is the apostrophe is for affective T
201440~005430~multiplied by ass and as you can see by just sending a sequel to jail maker
206870~004480~in fact this reduces to the corresponding Fourier transform property
211350~002280~and
213630~003260~a third property that in fact will make frequent you so
216890~003220~is referred to as the convolution property
220110~005370~again a generalization of the convolution property for 48 transforms
225480~003280~here the convolution property says that
228760~003630~the applause transform the convolution a two-time functions
232390~003250~is the product love The Associated
235640~003600~the floss transforms now
239240~003040~its important at some point
242280~004170~to think carefully about the region of convergence
246450~003940~as we discuss these properties and let me just
250390~003050~draw your attention to the fact dead in
253440~003590~discussing properties fully and in detail
257030~003400~one has to pay attention not just to
260430~003880~how the algebraic expression changes
264310~004540~but also what the consequences are for the region of convergence
268850~004039~and thats discuss in somewhat more detail in the text and I won't do that
272889~000560~here
273449~004131~now the convolution property
277580~004869~leads to of course a very important and useful
282449~005161~mechanism for dealing with linear time-invariant systems
287610~003890~very much as the 48 transformed did in particular
291500~003160~the convolution property tells us that
294660~003460~if we have a linear time-invariant system
298120~003180~the output in the time domain of course is the convolution
301300~003109~of the input and the impulse response
304409~005301~in the applause transform domain the a-plus transformer the output
309710~003709~is the love plus transformer the impulse response
313419~003351~times the low-priced transformer the input
316770~003139~and again this of course is a generalization
319909~004320~love the corresponding property for 48 transports
324229~003240~in the case I'll the 48 transform
327469~003461~the Fourier transform the appalls response we refer to as the frequency
330930~001509~response
332439~003671~in the more general case with applause transforms
336110~004299~it's typical to refer to the apostrophe its former the impulse response
340409~003111~as the system function
343520~003220~now the
346740~003280~in talking about the system function
350020~005399~the issue some issues love the region of convergence and for that matter location
355419~002261~opposes the system function
357680~003859~are closely tied in and related
361539~004410~to issues of whether the system is stable and causal
365949~003460~and in fact there's some useful statements that can be made
369409~004241~that play an important role throughout the further discussion
373650~003759~for example we know from previous discussions
377409~004671~that the there's a condition for stability of a system which is absolute
382080~003290~integrability of the impulse response
385370~003019~and that in fact is the same condition
388389~004840~for convergence of the Fourier transform of the impulse response
393229~003921~what that says really is that
397150~004419~if a system is stable then the region of convergence
401569~005680~of the system function must include the che Omega axis which of course is where
407249~005151~the applause transform reduces to the Fourier transform
412400~004109~so that relates the regional convergence and stability
416509~003180~also you recall from last time
419689~003350~that we talked about the regional convergence associated with
423039~004440~right-sided time functions in particular for right-sided time function the reach
427479~001300~of convergence
428779~003540~must be to the right the rightmost poll
432319~003780~well if in fact we have a system that's causal
436099~003761~then the that causality
439860~003970~imposes the condition that the impulse response be right sided
443830~004880~its own fact for causality we would have a regional convergence
448710~003440~associated with the system function which is to the right to the right most
452150~001620~poll
453770~003190~now interestingly in very important is
456960~003280~the consequence if you put those two statements together
460240~003049~in particular your lead to the conclusion
463289~004511~that for stable causal system
467800~003829~all the polls must be in the left half
471629~003220~up the ass play what's the reason
474849~005020~the reason of course is that if the system is stable in causal
479869~003651~the regional convergence must be to the right of the rightmost poll
483520~003940~it must include DJ Omega axes obviously then
487460~003190~all the polls must be in the left after the S
490650~003329~and again that's an issue that is discussed
493979~004650~somewhat more carefully and in more detail in the text
498629~004530~now the properties that we're talking about here
503159~003460~are not the only properties there are many others
506619~003390~but these properties in particular provide
510009~003470~the mechanism as they did with Fourier transforms
513479~005321~for turning linear constant coefficient differential equations into algebraic
518800~001369~equations
520169~003891~and correspondingly lead to a mechanism
524060~004029~for dealing with solving when your constant coefficient differential
528089~000821~equations
528910~003330~and I'd like to illustrate that by looking
532240~003789~at both first-order and second-order differential equations
536029~003351~let's begin first evolve with the first-order
539380~004050~differential equation and in so what we're talking about
543430~003090~is a first order system
546520~003450~what I mean by that is a system that's
549970~004900~characterize by a first-order differential equation
554870~003640~and if we apply to this equation the
558510~003210~differentiation property then
561720~003110~the derivative the prosperous for the derivative
564830~003770~is s times the apostrophe s former the time function
568600~003970~the linearity property allows us to combine these two gether
572570~005080~and so consequently applying the law applies transformed to this equation
577650~004660~leads us to this algebraic equation and following that through
582310~003690~leads us to the statement that the a-plus trance for the output
586000~004670~is one over est plus a times the applause transformer the input
590670~004450~we know from the convolution property that in fact this full price transform
595120~001400~is the system function
596520~004510~times X evas and so one over est plus a a
601030~004270~is the system function or equivalently the applause transform of the impulse
605300~002150~response
607450~003840~so we can determine the impulse response
611290~003500~by taking the inverse Laplace transform
614790~006080~all HFS given by one over est plus a
620870~005210~well we can do that using the inspection method which is one way that we have
626080~004240~doing inverse Laplace transforms the question is then what time
630320~005320~function has a plus transform which is one over est plus a
635640~005290~the problem that we run into in fact is that there are two answers to that
640930~004120~one over est plus 80 is the applause transform
645050~004450~are an exponential for positive time
649500~004130~but one over est plus a is also the apostrophe s for
653630~003900~Aug an exponential for negative time
657530~003840~which one of these do we end up picking
661370~003210~well recall that the difference between the
664580~003360~is was in their region of convergence and in fact
667940~004490~in this case this corresponded to a region of convergence
672430~004330~which was the real part a vast greater than minus a
676760~004270~in this case this was the corresponding applause transform
681030~003090~provided at the real party bass is
684120~004620~less than mine is a so we have to decide
688740~003030~which region of convergence that we pick
691770~003990~and it's not the differential equation that will tell us that
695760~003870~its something else that has to give us that information
699630~004370~what could it be well what it might be is the additional
704000~005220~information that the system is either stable or causal
709220~003780~so for example if the system was causal we would know that the regional
713000~002800~convergence is to the right of the poll
715800~003490~and that would correspond and to this
719290~003380~being the impulse response
722670~003580~whereas with a negative
726250~003540~I'm sorry with a positive if we knew
729790~003060~that the system let's say was not causal
732850~003460~then we would associate with that this region convergence
736310~004310~and we know that we would know then that this is the impulse response
740620~003650~so a very important point is that
744270~005040~what we see is that the when your car is the coefficient differential equation
749310~003480~gives us the algebraic
752790~003640~expression for the system function
756430~003680~but does not tell us about the region of convergence we get the region of
760110~001050~convergence
761160~003740~from some auxiliary information what is that information
764900~003520~well it might for example the knowledge that
768420~003290~the system is perhaps table
771710~002890~which tells us that the regional convergence includes the jail making
774600~001010~axis
775610~003760~or perhaps causal which tells us that the region of convergence
779370~005270~is to the right to the right most poll so it's the auxiliary information
784640~003370~specifies 4s the region of convergence
788010~003900~very important point the differential equation by itself is not completely
791910~001440~specify
793350~004500~the system it only essentially tells us what the algebraic expression is for the
797850~002450~system function
800300~003640~alright that's a first order example let's now look at
803940~004700~a second-order system and the differential equation that I picked
808640~004460~in this case I've parameterized in a certain way which will see will be
813100~001090~useful
814190~003400~in particular it's the second order differential equation and I've chosen
817590~003010~just for simplicity to not include
820600~003440~a derivatives on the right hand side although we could have
824040~004720~in fact if we did that would insert zeros into the system function
828760~004220~as well as the polls inserted by the left hand side
832980~004870~we can determine the system function in exactly the same way namely apply the
837850~002980~applause transformed to this equation
840830~003280~that would convert this differential equation to
844110~004320~an algebraic equation and now on we solve
848430~003200~this algebraic equation for why a bass
851630~004640~in terms of x a badass it will come out in the former why evas
856270~003590~equal to H a vast times X a badass
859860~004420~and H invest in that case we would get simply by dividing out by this
864280~004170~polynomial an ass and so the system function and
868450~003680~is the expression that I have here
872130~003970~so this is the form for second-order system
876100~004660~where there are two pole since this is the second order polynomial
880760~003280~there are no zeros Associated
884040~003920~in with the fact that I had no derivative up the input on the right
887960~003150~hand side of the equation
891110~003010~well let's look at this example
894120~003080~namely the second-order system a little more detail
897200~004510~and what we want to look at is the location at the polls and some issues
901710~004020~such as for example the frequency response
905730~003680~so here again I have the algebraic
909410~003340~expression for the system function
912750~003880~in and as i indicated this is the second order polynomial
916630~004160~which means that we can factor it into two routes
920790~006490~and so c1 and c2 represent the polls have the system function
927280~003380~and in particular in relation to the two parameters
930660~004000~say to and Omega Sapan if we look at
934660~003480~what these routes are than what we get
938140~004520~are the to expressions that I have below
942660~004950~and notice incidently dead if data is
947610~003950~less than 1 than what's under the square root
951560~004500~is negative and so this in fact corresponds to an imaginary
956060~003370~part an imaginary term for Zeta less than 1
959430~003200~and so the two routes then have
962630~004660~a real part which is given by -8 Omega Sapan
967290~003950~and an imaginary part if I were to rewrite this
971240~004740~and then expressed in terms or Jr skirted -1
975980~003700~in looking below will have a real part
979680~005450~which is -8 Omega Sapan an imaginary part which is omega Sapan
985130~003330~times this square root thats reseda
988460~003730~less than 1 and for Zeta greater than one
992190~003170~the two routes of course will be real
995360~003919~part so let's examine this for the case where
999279~003431~data is less than 1 and
1002710~004890~what that corresponds to then are to polls in the complex
1007600~003440~plane and they have
1011040~003650~a real part and an imaginary part
1014690~004230~and you can exploit this is somewhat more detail on your own
1018920~004190~but essentially what happens is that as you keep the parameter
1023110~003219~Omega stuff and fixed and very
1026329~003590~data these polls trace out
1029919~003280~a circle and for example
1033199~003120~with say to equal to 0 the polls
1036319~003730~are on the jail may access at Omega Sapan
1040049~003640~for as as say to
1043689~003171~because once as a day
1046860~003410~increases and gets closer to one
1050270~003889~these the polls converge toward the real axis
1054159~003150~and any particular for
1057309~003000~say to greater than one what we end up with
1060309~004131~are to polls on the real axis
1064440~003650~well actually the case that we want to look at
1068090~003380~a little more carefully is when the polls are complex
1071470~004610~and what this becomes is a second-order system which has we'll see
1076080~003590~as the discussion goes on as an impulse response which
1079670~004270~oscillates with time correspondingly a frequency response
1083940~003930~that has a residence well let's examine
1087870~003400~the frequency response little more carefully
1091270~004120~and 1 I'm assuming in the discussion is that first of all
1095390~003980~the polls are in the left half plane corresponding
1099370~003290~to they don't make this a ban being positive
1102660~004210~and so this is minus that is negative and furthermore I'm assuming that the
1106870~002860~polls are complex
1109730~003860~and in that case the algebraic expression
1113590~005060~for the system function is omega cement squared in the numerator and two poles
1118650~004050~in the denominator which a complex conjugates
1122700~003330~now what we want to look at is
1126030~003700~the frequency response the system
1129730~003920~and that corresponds to looking at
1133650~003170~the 4e a transformer the impulse response
1136820~004000~which is the a-plus transform on the jail making access
1140820~003739~so we want to examine what HSC is as we move
1144559~004191~along the jail make axes and notice that to do that
1148750~003120~in this algebraic expression
1151870~003270~we want to set s equal to jail maker and then
1155140~004380~evaluate for example we want to look at the magnet to the frequency response
1159520~005220~evaluate the magnet to of the complex number
1164740~003520~well there's a very convenient way of doing that geometrically
1168260~005190~by recognizing dead in the complex plane
1173450~004130~this complex number minus back complex number represents a vector
1177580~004620~and essentially to look at the magnitude of this complex number
1182200~005170~corresponds to taking omega Steuben squared and dividing it
1187370~004350~by the product all the links of these factors
1191720~004920~so let's look for example at the vector ass minus C-one
1196640~004250~where s is on the Chi Omega axis
1200890~003200~and doing that here is
1204090~003590~the vector C-one
1207680~004940~and here is the vector ass which is jail make if we're looking let's say at this
1212620~001560~bad you frequency
1214180~003010~and this specter than is the vector
1217190~003500~which he is J Omega minus C-one
1220690~003110~so in fact it's the link that this vector
1223800~003540~that we want to observed as we change
1227340~003870~Omega namely as we move along the Chi Omega axis
1231210~003460~you want to take this specter and this specter
1234670~004050~take the lights at those factors multiply them together
1238720~003580~divide that it will make its offense where'd and that will give us
1242300~003150~the frequency response that's little heart
1245450~003910~to see at a frequency response will work out just looking at one point although
1249360~004090~notice that as we move along the jail make axes
1253450~004600~as we get closer to this poll this vector in fact gets shorter
1258050~003070~at so we might expect that
1261120~004000~the frequency response as a moving along the Chi Omega axis in the vicinity is
1265120~000820~that poll
1265940~003470~would start to pee well I think that all of this
1269410~004050~is much better seen dynamically on the computer display
1273460~003380~so let's go to the computer display and what we look at
1276840~004920~is a second-order system the frequency response a bit as we move
1281760~003590~along jail make acts
1285350~004010~so here we see the poll pair in the complex plane
1289360~003800~and to generate the frequency response
1293160~004530~we want to look at the behavior of the poll vectors as we move vertically
1297690~003500~along the chair make axis so we'll
1301190~003670~show the poll vectors and let's begin
1304860~005190~at Omega equal 0 so here we have the poll vectors from the polls to the point
1310050~006280~Omega equal to 0 and as we move vertically along the jail make axis will
1316330~003349~see how the those poll vectors
1319679~004581~change in length the magnitude of the frequency response is the reciprocal
1324260~003080~the product are the lights are those factors
1327340~003700~shown below is the frequency response
1331040~003720~where we've begun just that'll make equal to 0
1334760~004730~and as we move vertically
1339490~005520~along the jail make axis and the poll vector last change
1345010~004290~that will then influence what the frequency response looks like we've
1349300~004160~started here too move a little bit
1353460~003540~away from Omega equal to 0 and
1357000~004640~notice that in the upper half plane the poll vector has gotten shorter
1361640~004130~the poll vector for the pole in the lower half plane has gotten longer
1365770~003539~and now as omega increases further
1369309~004271~that process will continue and in particular
1373580~004070~the poll vector associated with the poll in the upper half plane
1377650~003730~will be as short as in the vicinity
1381380~003440~are in a freak at a frequency in the vicinity of that poll
1384820~004820~and so for that frequency than the frequency response will P
1389640~003850~and we see that here
1393490~004100~from this point as the frequency increases
1397590~004120~corresponding to moving further vertically along the chair maker axes
1401710~003550~both poll vectors will increase in laying
1405260~003510~and that means then dead the magnet to
1408770~004670~the frequency response will decrease for this specific example
1413440~003140~the magnitude of the frequency response will
1416580~003340~asymptotically go to zero
1419920~005420~so what we see here is there the frequency response has a resonance
1425340~004100~and as we see geometrically from the way
1429440~003960~defectors behave their residence in frequency
1433400~005240~is very clearly associated with the position at the polls
1438640~003710~and so in fact illustrate that further and
1442350~003880~dramatize it as long as we're focused on it let's now
1446230~003990~look at the frequency response for the second order example
1450220~005630~as we change the pole positions and first what we'll do
1455850~003480~is let the polls move vertically
1459330~003290~parallel to the Chi Omega axes and see how the frequency
1462620~003500~response changes and then we'll have the polls move
1466120~005840~horizontally parallel to the relaxes and see how the frequency response changes
1471960~004820~to display the behavior the frequency response is the polls move we've
1476780~003050~change the vertical scale on
1479830~003560~the frequency response somewhat and
1483390~003780~now what we want to do is move the polls
1487170~003879~first parallel to the jail make axis and then
1491049~003731~parallel to the real axis here we see the
1494780~003920~effect moving the polls parallel to the jail may axis
1498700~004190~and what we observe is that in fact the frequency
1502890~004280~location the residence shifts basically tracking
1507170~003360~the location at the pole
1510530~003700~if we now move the poll back
1514230~003220~down closer to the real axis then
1517450~005300~this residents will shift back toward its original location
1522750~007000~and so let's now see that
1539070~003989~and here we are back at the frequency that we started at
1543059~004750~now will move the polls even closer to the real axis
1547809~003661~the frequency location at the residence
1551470~003150~will continue to shift toward lower frequencies
1554620~003280~and also in the process incidently
1557900~003909~the height ove the resonant peak will increase
1561809~003081~because of course the lengths love
1564890~003190~the poll factors are getting shorter
1568080~005890~and so we see now the residence shifting down toward lower and lower frequency
1573970~003490~and finally what
1577460~003980~will now do is move the polls back to their
1581440~003830~original position and the resonant peak will
1585270~004320~of course shift back up and correspondingly
1589590~003290~the height or amplitude the residence
1592880~007000~will decrease and now we're back at the frequency response that
1602000~005580~we head generated previously next we'd like to look at the behavior as the
1607580~000680~polls
1608260~004810~move parallel to the real axis first closer to the J Omega axis and then
1613070~001040~further away
1614110~003040~as they move closer to the jail make access
1617150~004080~the residence sharpens because of the fact
1621230~004320~that the poll factor get shorter and responds
1625550~004520~or changes in like more quickly as we move past it
1630070~003900~moving along the jail make axis so
1633970~005730~here we see the effect a move in the polls closer to the jail make axis
1639700~004130~the residence has gotten narrower in frequency
1643830~005560~and higher in amplitude associated with the fact that the poll vector get
1649390~000680~shorter
1650070~003760~next
1653830~004360~as we move back to the original location
1658190~003489~the residents will broaden once again and the airport to
1661679~007000~will decrease
1674179~004261~and then if we continue to move the polls even further away
1678440~004040~from the real axis the residents will broaden
1682480~003620~even further and the ample to the peak will
1686100~007000~become even smaller and finally
1694799~003151~let's now just move the polls back to
1697950~003270~their original position and we'll see
1701220~007000~the Reds residence narrow again and become higher
1714559~003570~and so what we see then is that for
1718129~005400~a second-order system the behavior above the residents basically is associated
1723529~004640~with the Polo cations the frequency the residence associated with the vertical
1728169~001260~position in the polls
1729429~003561~and the sharpness at the residence
1732990~005100~Associated with the real party polls in other words there
1738090~003329~position closer or further away from the
1741419~004740~J Omega axis okay so
1746159~004311~for complex polls then into the second order
1750470~003549~system what we see is that we get
1754019~003630~a resident kind of behavior and
1757649~003171~in particular then that resident behavior
1760820~003429~tens to peak or get pic year
1764249~003890~as the value of data gets smaller
1768139~003540~and here just to remind you what you saw
1771679~003431~here is the frequency response with
1775110~005169~one particular choices values well this is normalized to make a span is one one
1780279~001671~particular choice for Zeta
1781950~003120~family .4 here is
1785070~003979~what we have with say to smaller
1789049~004330~and finally here is example
1793379~004451~where say that has gotten even smaller than that and what that corresponds to
1797830~003500~is the polls moving closer to the jail make axes
1801330~003380~the corresponding frequency response getting PQ
1804710~003439~now in the
1808149~003480~time-domain what happens is that
1811629~003140~we have of course these complex roots
1814769~003681~which I indicated previously where
1818450~003709~this represents the imaginary part because data is less than one
1822159~003051~and in the time domain we will have
1825210~003250~a form for the behavior which is a
1828460~003839~e2 the C-one TV plus a conjugate
1832299~003720~eat so the C-one conjugate
1836019~003691~see and so
1839710~006370~in fact as the polls get closer to the jail make axis cars fine to use a to
1846080~000979~getting smaller
1847059~003220~as the polls get closer to
1850279~003571~the chair maker axis in the frequency domain
1853850~003409~the residences get sharper in the time domain
1857259~003221~the real part all the polls has gotten smaller
1860480~003699~and that means in fact that in the time domain
1864179~003620~behavior will be more oscillatory and less than
1867799~003960~and so just looking at that again
1871759~004370~here is in the time domain
1876129~003150~what happens first IPL with
1879279~003311~and the parameter say to equal to
1882590~004069~.4 and isolates an exponentially
1886659~003150~dies out year
1889809~004131~is the second-order system
1893940~003359~where data is now point to is that a point for
1897299~003760~and finally the second-order system
1901059~003200~wears a to is .1
1904259~003951~and what we see as say to get smaller and smaller
1908210~004299~is dead the oscillations are basically the same but
1912509~003091~the exponential damping becomes
1915600~003620~less and less right now
1919220~004389~this is a somewhat more detailed look at second-order systems
1923609~005290~and second or two systems and for that matter first order systems are
1928899~004000~systems that are important in their own right but
1932899~004671~they also are important as basic building blocks
1937570~003770~for more general in particular for higher-order systems
1941340~003179~and the way in which that stone typically
1944519~003660~is by combining first- and second-order systems together
1948179~003250~in such a way that they implement higher-order systems
1951429~003171~and two very common connections are
1954600~003120~connections which are cascade connections
1957720~005970~and connections which are parallel connections in a cascade connection
1963690~003599~we would think love combining this system
1967289~004770~systems individual systems together as i indicated herein series
1972059~004750~and of course from the convolution property the overall system function
1976809~004480~is the product of the individual system functions
1981289~003041~so for example if these were all
1984330~005779~second-order systems and I A combined and have them together in cascade
1990109~003540~the overall system would be a system that would have
1993649~004541~2n polls in other words it would be a 2n order system
1998190~003489~that's one very common kind of connection another
2001679~003960~very common kind of connection for first- and second-order systems
2005639~003611~is a parallel connection where in that case
2009250~004750~we connect the systems together as they indicate here
2014000~005389~the overall system function is just simply the sum of these and that follows
2019389~002341~from the linearity property
2021730~003579~and so the overall system function would be as i indicate
2025309~003580~algebraically here and notice that
2028889~003420~if each of these are second-order systems
2032309~003450~and I had capital and have them in parallel
2035759~003681~when you think a putting the overall system function over one common
2039440~001199~denominator
2040639~003980~that common denominator in general is going to be
2044619~003361~all order to an so either
2047980~003389~the parallel connection or the Cascade connection
2051369~004980~can be used to implement higher-order systems
2056349~003800~one very common context in which second-order systems
2060149~003341~are combined together either in parallel
2063490~003379~or in cascade to form a
2066869~003841~more interesting system is in fact
2070710~003300~in speech synthesis and what I'd like to do is
2074010~004460~demonstrate a speech synthesizer which I have here
2078470~003070~which in fact is a parallel
2081540~003629~combination 04 second-order
2085169~004771~systems very much are the type that we've just talked about
2089940~004020~all returned to the synthesizer in a minute let me
2093960~004170~first just indicate with the basic idea is in speech synthesis
2098130~005150~of course what we're trying to represent a reply man is something dead
2103280~003250~corresponds to the vocal tract
2106530~004240~the vocal tract is characterized by said residences
2110770~003299~and we can think of representing you to those residences by a second-order
2114069~001101~system
2115170~003710~and then the higher-order system corresponding to the vocal tract
2118880~003410~is built by in this case a parallel combination
2122290~003400~the second-order systems and so
2125690~004450~for the synthesizer what we have connected together
2130140~003110~in parallel is 4
2133250~003520~second-order systems and
2136770~005220~a control on each one of them that controls the center frequency
2141990~003480~or the resonant frequency love each oath
2145470~003460~the second-order systems
2148930~003619~the exhortation is an exhortation
2152549~003711~that would represent the airflow through the vocal cords
2156260~003500~the vocal cords vibrate and their pop severe
2159760~004680~through the vocal cords as they open and close it so the exhortation
2164440~003250~for the synthesizer corresponds to
2167690~003919~a pulse train representing
2171609~004771~the airflow through the vocal cords the fundamental frequency if this
2176380~003330~representing the fundamental frequency love
2179710~004069~the synthesized voice so that's the basic
2183779~004060~structure the synthesizer and what we have in this
2187839~004171~analog synthesizer are separate controls
2192010~003599~on the individual center frequencies
2195609~004591~their is a control representing the center frequency of the third resonator
2200200~004379~and the fourth resonator and those are represented by these two knobs
2204579~003290~and then the first and second resonators
2207869~004200~are controlled by moving this joystick the first resonator
2212069~004221~by moving the joystick along this axis
2216290~004750~and the second resonator by moving the joystick along this axis
2221040~003440~and then in addition to controls on
2224480~003379~the for resonators we can control
2227859~003951~the fundamental frequency the exhortation and we do that
2231810~004120~with this not so let's first of all just listen
2235930~004000~to wanted the resonators and the resonator that
2239930~003169~I'll play is the fourth resonator and
2243099~003651~what you'll hear first is the output as a very
2246750~005000~the center frequency of that resonator stonewalling
2251750~003579~share
2255329~005471~and then free she's acts
2260800~004580~and then as I A indicated I can also control the fundamental frequency the
2265380~001060~exhortation
2266440~004730~by turning this knob Ste
2271170~004800~slowing the fundamentals she K
2275970~006000~he
2281970~003910~all right now if the four resonators in parallel
2285880~003980~are and implementation love the vocal cavity
2289860~003910~then presumably we can synthesize when we put them all in
2293770~003610~are Val sounds and let's do that
2297380~003300~on now switch in the other resonators
2300680~003090~when we do that then
2303770~003050~depending on
2306820~003720~what choice we have to the individual resonant frequencies
2310540~004210~we should be able to synthesize balanced sound so here for example is the Val
2314750~003630~E Ste here's
2318380~003760~of
2322140~002869~act and
2325009~002151~course we can
2327160~001120~generate
2328280~003110~lots of other Val sounds
2331390~007000~and change the fundamental frequency same time
2341609~002061~now if we want to synthesize speech
2343670~004050~it's not enough to just synthesized steady-state Balzac its
2347720~003250~boring after a while course what happens with
2350970~004010~the vocal cavity is that it moves as a function of time
2354980~003770~and that's what generates the the
2358750~003660~speech that we want to generate and so
2362410~003500~presumably man if we change these
2365910~003659~resonant frequencies as a function of time appropriately
2369569~004181~then we should be able to synthesize speech and so by
2373750~003490~moving these residences around weekend generate
2377240~003789~synthesized speech and can let's try it
2381029~003490~a with some phrases and I'll do that
2384519~003221~by simply adjusting the center frequencies appropriately
2387740~003650~now
2391390~007000~well hopefully you
2398559~004800~understood that is you can imagine I spend at least a few minutes before
2403359~003410~the lecture try to practice that's so that it would come out
2406769~003830~to be more less intelligible now
2410599~003381~the system as i've just demonstrated is
2413980~004829~of course a continuous-time system or an analyte speech synthesizer
2418809~003470~their are many versions of
2422279~004361~digital or discrete-time synthesizers one of the first in fact
2426640~003760~being a device that many view
2430400~003889~are very likely familiar with which is the Texas Instruments speak n spell
2434289~000881~which
2435170~003050~I show here and what's
2438220~003740~very interesting and rather dramatic about this device
2441960~004220~is the fact that it implements the speech synthesis in very much the same
2446180~001290~way as
2447470~003930~I've demonstrated with the analog synthesizer
2451400~004000~in this case it's five second-order filters
2455400~002919~in a configuration that slightly different than a parallel configuration
2458319~001800~but conceptually
2460119~003531~very closely related and let's take a look
2463650~003949~inside the box and what we see their
2467599~003510~with a slide that was kindly supplied by Texas Instruments
2471109~004190~is the fact that there really are only four chips in the air
2475299~004861~a controller chips and storage and the important point is the chip that's
2480160~000639~labeled
2480799~003310~as the speech synthesis chip in fact
2484109~003781~is what embodies our implements the five
2487890~003429~second order filters and in addition
2491319~004280~incorporate some other things a memory and also the
2495599~003510~D-day converters so in fact the
2499109~004150~implementation and the synthesizer is pretty much done on a single chip
2503259~003931~well that's a discrete-time
2507190~004040~system we've been talking for the last
2511230~005539~several lectures about continuous-time systems and no fuss transform
2516769~003961~hopefully what you've seen in this lecture in the previous lecture
2520730~004170~is the powerful tool
2524900~003179~dead the a poss transform affords us
2528079~003040~in analyzing and understanding
2531119~004531~system behavior in the next lecture
2535650~003659~what I'd like to do is parallel the discussion
2539309~003240~for discrete-time turn our attention to busy transform
2542549~004760~and as you can imagine simply by virtue of the fact that
2547309~003581~we I've kinda shown you a digital and analog
2550890~004050~version a very much the same kind of system the discussions
2554940~004020~how all themselves very strongly and dizzy transform
2558960~003510~will play very much the same role in discrete-time that
2562470~002879~the apostrophe is formed dozen continues thank you
