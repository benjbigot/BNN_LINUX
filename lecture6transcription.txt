020590~007000~ha
042000~003050~the norm
045050~007000~are
055810~003440~over the past several lectures we've developed the representation for linear
059250~001550~time-invariant systems
060800~003710~in a particularly important center systems
064510~004260~which are linear and time-invariant are those that are represented by linear
068770~003710~constant coefficient differential equations continuous-time
072480~003620~or when your constant coefficient difference equations
076100~005250~in discrete-time for example electrical circuits that are built let's say I dove
081350~003240~resistors inductors and capacitors perhaps with %ah pants
084590~004200~correspond to systems described by differential equations
088790~003750~mechanical systems with springs and dash pots likewise
092540~003620~are described by differential equations and in the discrete-time
096160~004090~case things such as moving average filters
100250~005030~digital filters and most simple kinda data smoothing
105280~003650~are all linear constant coefficient difference equations
108930~003120~now presumably
112050~004700~in a previous course you've had some exposure to
116750~004250~differential equations for continuous-time and
121000~004030~their solution using notions like particular solution and homogeneous
125030~002250~solution initial conditions center
127280~003640~later on in the course
130920~004690~when we've developed the concept to the 48 transforming after that the
135610~001420~apostrophe its form
137030~003910~will see some very efficient and useful ways
140940~003380~generating solutions both differential and difference equations
144320~003360~at this point however I'd like to
147680~003150~just introduce when your constant coefficient
150830~003860~differential equations and the discrete-time counterpart
154690~003170~and address among other things the issue
157860~004360~love when they do and don't correspond to linear time-invariant systems
162220~003510~well let's first consider
165730~003280~what I refer to as an nth order
169010~003580~linear constant coefficients differential equation as i've indicated
172590~001040~here
173630~004960~and what it consists of is a linear combination of derivatives up the system
178590~000790~output
179380~003420~y'at equal to a linear combination
182800~003130~of derivatives above the system input accept T
185930~003030~and is referred to
188960~004540~as a constant coefficients equation of course because the
193500~004720~coefficients are constant in other words not assume to be time-varying
198220~003060~and its referred to
201280~005270~as linear because it corresponds to a linear combination
206550~003770~love these derivatives not because
210320~003110~it corresponds to a linear system and in fact
213430~003450~as we'll see or as all indicate this
216880~003300~equation may or may not in fact correspond to
220180~004470~when your system in the discrete-time case
224650~005540~the corresponding equation is a linear constant coefficient difference equation
230190~003420~and that corresponds to again
233610~005190~a linear combination love the late versions of the output equal to
238800~003440~a linear combination love the late versions at the input
242240~003150~this equation is referred to as an nth order
245390~004670~difference equation the N referring to the number of the ladies
250060~004800~are the output involved just as an aunt order differential equation
254860~004149~the N for the order the equation refers to the number of derivatives
259009~003851~the output now let's first begin
262860~003760~with the near constant coefficient differential equations
266620~003970~and the basic
270590~003040~point or the solution for
273630~003450~the differential equations is the fact dead
277080~003080~if we've generated some solution
280160~004200~which I refer to here's why superiority some solution
284360~003460~to the equation for a given input then
287820~003140~in fact we can and to that solution
290960~003130~any other solution which
294090~003609~satisfies what's referred to as
297699~003621~the homogeneous equation so in fact
301320~003860~this differential equation by itself
305180~003019~is not a unique specification
308199~002130~the system
310329~003100~if I have any solution then I can
313429~005300~and to that solution any other solution which satisfies the homogeneous equation
318729~001430~and thus all those two
320159~004240~likewise be a solution and that's very straight forward to verify
324399~003920~by simply substituting into the differential equation
328319~005070~some love the particular a particular and the homogeneous solution
333389~004480~and what you see is that the homogeneous contribution
337869~003310~in fact goes to zero by definition
341179~004010~what we mean by the homogeneous equation now
345189~005650~the homogeneous solution for a when your constant coefficient differential
350839~000820~equation
351659~003510~is of the form that I
355169~003570~indicate at the bottom and
358739~003130~it typically consists love a
361869~004810~song or capital and complex exponentials
366679~003120~and the Constance
369799~003060~are on determined by the equation itself
372859~004230~and this form for the homogeneous solution
377089~005120~in essence drops out love examining
382209~004340~the homogeneous equation where
386549~003880~if we assume that the former the homogeneous solution
390429~003780~is a complex exponential with some
394209~004020~on specified amplitude and unspecified exponent
398229~004140~if we substitute this into are homogeneous equation
402369~003250~we end up with the equation that i've indicated
405619~004010~year the factor A&E the st. can in fact be
409629~003981~cancelled out and we find there that equation
413610~002570~is satisfied
416180~003120~for capital N values
419300~003560~love s and
422860~003550~that's true no matter what choices made for these
426410~004000~coefficients and the essential consequence
430410~003470~have all of that is that the homogeneous solution
433880~003770~is of the form that I indicated previously
437650~003240~namely it consists love some
440890~003930~love capital and complex exponentials
444820~003830~where the coefficients the capital and coefficients
448650~003120~attached to you to those complex exponentials
451770~003199~is undetermined Iran specified
454969~003240~so what this says is that in order to
458209~004420~obtain the solution for a win here comes the coefficient differential equation
462629~003090~we need some kind of auxiliary information
465719~004060~tells us how to obtain these capital and
469779~003940~undetermined Constance and there are a variety of ways
473719~003950~specifying this auxiliary information or auxiliary conditions
477669~004390~for example in addition to the differential equation
482059~003710~what I can tell you is the value
485769~003091~of the output and and -1 up there
488860~003449~and -1 if its derivatives at some
492309~003590~specified time t0 and
495899~003961~so the differential equations together
499860~003599~with the auxiliary information the initial conditions
503459~003401~van lets you determine the total solution
506860~004569~which namely lets you determine these previously unspecified
511429~003701~coefficients in the homogeneous solution
515130~005250~now depending on how the auxiliary information is stated or what auxiliary
520380~001599~information is available
521979~003771~the system a or may not correspond
525750~003930~to a linear system and may or may not correspond to a linear time-invariant
529680~003520~system one essential condition
533200~003449~for it to correspond to a linear system is that
536649~003690~the initial conditions must be zero
540339~003681~and one can see the reason for that
544020~005830~if we refer back to the previous lecture in which we saw that for a linear system
549850~003000~if we put 0n we get zero out
552850~004480~so if exit see the input is zero the output must be zero
557330~004629~and so that in essence tells us that at least for the system to be linear
561959~003000~these initial conditions must be zero
564959~003451~now beyond that if
568410~003100~we want the system to be
571510~004120~causal and linear time in and time-invariant
575630~003290~then what's required on the
578920~003680~initial conditions is that they be consistent with
582600~005359~what's referred to as initial rest initial arrest says
587959~003241~that the output must be
591200~003220~0 up until the time
594420~003770~that the input becomes 90 and we can see
598190~003350~of course that that's consistent with the notion of causality as
601540~003810~we talked about in the previous lecture and
605350~004239~its relatively straightforward to see
609589~004801~that if the system is causal and linear and time-invariant
614390~003160~that will require
617550~003820~initial rest it's somewhat more difficult see
621370~006050~that if we specify initial rest the NAT in fact is sufficient to
627420~003450~determine that the system is both causal in linear
630870~003550~and time very but the essential point then is that
634420~003330~requires initial rest for both linearity
637750~003520~and causality okay well
641270~003530~let's look at an example and
644800~004390~let's take the example love a first-order
649190~003280~differential equation as I've
652470~003040~indicated here so we have
655510~003490~a first-order differential equation the wife TTT
659000~003130~was a yote is the input exit
662130~003030~T and let's first
665160~003360~look at what the homogeneous solution this equation is
668520~003650~and so we can consider the homogeneous equation
672170~004840~namely the equation specify solutions
677010~004310~which would correspond to zero input
681320~003200~we in essence guess for impose
684520~004170~a solution love the form the homogeneous solution
688690~004410~is an amplitude factor times the complex exponential
693100~004220~substituting this into the homogeneous equation
697320~003270~we then get the equation that i've indicated here
700590~004340~what you can see is that this equates in this equation
704930~004910~I can cancel out the amplitude factor and this complex exponential
709840~006320~so let's just cancel those out on both sides of the equation
716160~004140~and what we're left with is an equation
720300~004210~that specifies what the complex exponent must be
724510~005110~in particular for the homogeneous solution s must be equal to minus a
729620~003160~and so finally are homogeneous solution
732780~005849~is as I've indicated year
738629~005380~okay now let's look at the solution for specific input let's consider for
744009~001220~example input
745229~003410~which is a scale units step and
748639~003570~although I won't work at the solution in detail and perhaps
752209~003820~using what you've worked on previously
756029~003550~you know how to carry out the solution for that the
759579~003090~a solution with step input
762669~005000~is what i've indicated here scaler one minus the next financial times unit
767669~004280~staff and you can verify that simply by substituting into the differential
771949~001860~equations now
773809~004090~we know that there's a family of solutions in other words
777899~003060~any solution with
780959~003770~a homogeneous solution added to it is again a solution
784729~004770~and so if we consider the solution I just indicated
789499~003670~we generate the entire family of solutions by
793169~003290~ending a homogeneous solution to it and so
796459~003920~this then corresponds to the entire family of solutions
800379~004280~where the constant a is unspecified
804659~006811~so far and needs to be specified through some type avoids avery conditions
811470~003079~now a class A auxiliary conditions
814549~003230~is the Commissioner initial rest which
817779~005970~as i indicated before is equivalent to the statement that the system
823749~003740~is causal and linear and time-invariant and
827489~003820~in that case for the initial rest condition
831309~003830~we would then require in this equation above
835139~003920~that this constant be equal to 0
839059~003370~and so finally the response
842429~003310~to scales step if the system
845739~003550~is the correspond to cause a linear time-invariant system
849289~003300~is then just this term namely
852589~003210~constant times one minus an exponential
855799~002821~times step
858620~003640~okay now if the system is a linear time-invariant system
862260~003550~it can as we know be described through its impulse response
865810~003310~and as you've worked out previously
869120~003279~in the video course manual for
872399~003741~a linear time-invariant system the impulse response
876140~004420~is the derivative love the step response adjusted quickly remind you
880560~004269~love where that result comes from in essence
884829~004641~we can consider to linear time-invariant systems and Cascade
889470~003790~wanna differentiator the other the system that we're talking about
893260~001360~described by
894620~004360~the differential equation and step in here
898980~003390~then generated in polls into our system
902370~003820~and out comes the impulse response well just using the fact that
906190~004350~these are both linear time-invariant systems and they can be cascaded in
910540~000880~either order
911420~004010~then means that if we have step response
915430~004390~to our system and that goes through differentiator
919820~004780~what must come out again is the impulse response
924600~004340~so differentiating the step response we get the impulse response
928940~003519~here again is the step response as we
932459~005000~just worked it out this time for you next step if we differentiate
937459~003310~we have then since the step response
940769~003891~is the product of two terms the derivative a product is the sum
944660~003830~the derivatives and carrying that algebra through
948490~003370~and using the fact that the derivative the step
951860~003310~is an impulse finally we come down
955170~003580~to this statement for the impulse response
958750~003149~and then recognizing that this is but I'm
961899~003050~function times and in polls and we know
964949~003711~that a time function times in polls takes on
968660~004380~the value at the time that the impulse occurs
973040~004320~then this term is simply 0
977360~003250~and the impulse response then
980610~003300~finally is an exponential this for
983910~004090~and this is the peking exponential for a positive
988000~004240~it's a growing exponentially for a negative and
992240~004469~recall that as we talked about previously
996709~003721~a system is a linear time-invariant system is stable
1000430~003880~if its impulse response is absolutely integral
1004310~004690~for this particular case this impulse response
1009000~003070~is absolutely integral provided that
1012070~003360~the exponential factor a
1015430~003530~is greater than 0
1018960~003170~okay so what we've seen then is the
1022130~005090~impulse response for system described by a linear constant coefficient
1027220~001380~differential equation
1028600~003210~where in addition we will impose causality
1031810~003950~when you're ready in time invariance essentially through the initial
1035760~000820~conditions
1036580~002959~love initial rest
1039539~003850~now pretty much the same kinds of things happen
1043389~003450~with difference equations as we've gone through
1046839~003891~with differential equations in particular
1050730~003120~again let me remind you love the form love
1053850~003470~and aunt order when your constant coefficient difference equation
1057320~004170~its as I indicate here and
1061490~005569~again a linear combination this time the late versions of the output equal to a
1067059~001171~linear combination
1068230~004329~up the late versions love the input once again
1072559~004211~the difference equation is not
1076770~004420~a complete specification the system because we can and to the response
1081190~003470~any homogeneous solution in other words
1084660~003680~any solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation
1088340~003660~in the summer those well also satisfy the original
1092000~005519~difference equation so if we have
1097519~003861~a particular response that satisfies
1101380~003909~the difference equation then ending to that
1105289~005750~any response there is a solution to the homogeneous equation
1111039~005591~will also be a solution to the total equation
1116630~004710~the homogeneous solution again is of the form
1121340~003850~of a linear combination of exponentials here
1125190~004000~we have the homogeneous equation as with
1129190~003459~differential equations we can
1132649~003171~guests or impose solutions for
1135820~003589~eight times an exponential when we substitute this
1139409~003301~into the homogeneous equation we then end up
1142710~004579~with equation that i've indicated here we recognize again
1147289~004510~there a the amplitude
1151799~003271~and seats at the end
1155070~003079~this exponential factor cancel out
1158149~004071~and so this equation is satisfied
1162220~003980~for any values love see
1166200~004800~that satisfy this equation and
1171000~003009~there are and roots C-one through Z and
1174009~003900~and so finally the form for the homogeneous solution
1177909~004531~is a linear combination love capital and
1182440~003680~exponentials capital and is the order the equation
1186120~004689~with each of those exponentials the ample to factor is undetermined
1190809~003671~and needs to be determined in some way through
1194480~003069~the imposition love appropriate
1197549~004461~initial conditions are boundary conditions
1202010~003040~so the general form then
1205050~003140~for the solution to the difference equation
1208190~003020~is
1211210~003689~some with the exponentials plus any particular solution
1214899~005681~its through auxiliary conditions that we determine
1220580~003030~these coefficients we have
1223610~003880~and undetermined coefficients and so
1227490~004419~we require capital and auxiliary conditions
1231909~003591~for example some set values
1235500~003139~of the output at and this thing instance
1238639~002581~time
1241220~000860~now this
1242080~003270~was the same as with differential equations in the case a differential
1245350~002240~equations we talked about specifying
1247590~003620~the value of the output and its derivatives and
1251210~003160~there we indicated dead for linearity
1254370~004300~what we required when the arity what we require
1258670~003410~is that the auxiliary conditions 30
1262080~003570~and the same thing applies here for the same reason
1265650~005260~namely if the system is to be linear and the response if there's no input must be
1270910~002550~equal to 0
1273460~002340~in addition what
1275800~002960~we may want to impose on the system is
1278760~003440~that it be causal and in addition to linear
1282200~003550~time-invariant and with that requires again
1285750~004950~is that it the auxiliary conditions be consistent with
1290700~003110~initial rest namely that if
1293810~003340~the input is zero prior to some time
1297150~005259~in the output is zero prior to the same time
1302409~003020~okay so we've seen a very direct parallel
1305429~003301~so far between differential equations
1308730~003500~and difference equations
1312230~003370~in fact one difference between them dead
1315600~003170~in some sense makes difference equations
1318770~003330~easier to deal with in some situations is dead
1322100~003930~in contrast to a differential equation a
1326030~003010~difference equation if we assume causality
1329040~003600~in fact is and explicit
1332640~003220~input-output relationship for the system now let me
1335860~002809~show you what I mean
1338669~004521~let's consider the n-th order difference equation as i've indicated here
1343190~003820~and let's assume that we're imposing causality
1347010~003669~so there'd the output can only depend
1350679~004321~on prior values at the input and therefore on fire values at the output
1355000~004020~well we can simply rearrange this equation
1359020~004620~solving for Y have an the leading term with cable 0
1363640~004860~taking all the other turns over to the right side of the equation
1368500~004159~and we then have a workers if equation
1372659~005371~namely that an equation expresses the output interns
1378030~003649~love prior values if the input which is this term
1381679~003981~and prior values at the output
1385660~003530~and so if in fact we have this equation running
1389190~003470~then once it started we know how to compute
1392660~004060~the output for the next time
1396720~001029~well
1397749~003310~how do we get started the way we get it started of course
1401059~003060~is through the appropriate said love
1404119~004430~initial conditions are boundary conditions and if for example
1408549~003580~we assume initial rest corresponding to a causal when you're time-invariant
1412129~001061~system
1413190~003389~then if the input is zero up until sometime
1416579~004330~the output must be zero up until that time and Matt in essence
1420909~004080~helps us get the equation started well let's look at this
1424989~003630~specifically in the context love a
1428619~003060~first-order difference equation so let's take
1431679~003120~a first-order difference equation
1434799~002781~as i've indicated here
1437580~004400~and so we have an equation that tells us that why I have and minus eight times
1441980~001520~wider than -1
1443500~003260~is equal to exit
1446760~003000~now if we want this to correspond to
1449760~003770~a causal linear time-invariant system we
1453530~003890~oppose initial impose initial rest on it we can
1457420~003740~rewrite the first-order difference equation by taking
1461160~003120~the term involving y ven -1
1464280~003950~over to the right hand side of the equation
1468230~003980~right now this gives us a workers if equation
1472210~005860~that expresses the output interns the input and past values at the output
1478070~004300~and since we've impose causality
1482370~003780~and if we're talking about a linear time-invariant system
1486150~004810~we can now inquire as to what the impulse responses and we know of course
1490960~001480~that the impulse response
1492440~004169~charles is everything that we need to know about the system
1496609~004700~okay so let's shoes and input which is
1501309~003400~an impulse so the impulse response
1504709~003390~is Beltre van corresponding
1508099~003690~to the exit and appear plus eighty Delta
1511789~003960~love this should be a chip N -1
1515749~004901~and let me just correct that this is a chip N -1
1520650~003400~so we have the impulse response as Delta van
1524050~004420~was eight times a Japan -1
1528470~003150~now from initial rest we know
1531620~005010~bad since the input namely an impulse is 0 for and less than zero
1536630~003510~the impulse response is likewise 0
1540140~003040~for and less 0 and now
1543180~004170~let's work out what 80 its well
1547350~003510~80 with an equal 0 is
1550860~003430~delta up zero plus eight times
1554290~003450~a chip N -1 HRN minus 10
1557740~007000~and so h0 is equal to 1
1565000~003370~okay now that we have a chance 0 we can figure at H
1568370~003380~one by running this recursive equations
1571750~003760~so 8 you've won is
1575510~003210~Delta love one which is zero
1578720~003590~plus eight times h0 which we just figured out as one
1582310~005500~so HR one is equal to a and if we carry this through
1587810~004220~will have a chip to equal to a squared and
1592030~004500~this will continue on and in fact we can recognize
1596530~003840~by looking at this and how we would expect these terms to build
1600370~003730~we would see that the impulse response a Japan
1604100~004060~in fact -ism form a to the end times
1608160~002499~you have an
1610659~003360~and we also can recognize then dead
1614019~004701~this corresponds to stable system
1618720~003080~if and only if the impulse response
1621800~004500~which is what we just figured out if and only if the impulse response
1626300~003800~is absolutely so noble and what that will require
1630100~006939~is that the magnitude a the less
1637039~004860~okay now we impose causality linear ready in time invariance
1641899~003311~and generated a solution recur simply
1645210~004380~and now of course if we want to generate the more general
1649590~003020~center solutions to this difference equation
1652610~003890~we can't do that by adding all of the
1656500~004029~homogeneous solutions namely all the solutions to satisfy the homogeneous
1660529~002811~equation so
1663340~003930~here we have the causal linear time-invariant
1667270~003000~impulse response in fact
1670270~005850~with an impulse input all of the possible solutions
1676120~003360~are that impulse response plus
1679480~005520~the homogeneous solutions the homogeneous solution is the solution
1685000~003270~that satisfies the homogeneous equation
1688270~003019~that will in general
1691289~003601~believe the form an amplitude factor
1694890~003240~times an exponential factor and
1698130~003000~if we substitute this into this equation
1701130~003019~then we see that the homogeneous
1704149~003431~equation is satisfied for any values have a
1707580~004020~in any values see that satisfy
1711600~004530~this equation again as we did with differential equations
1716130~007000~the factor Amy cancels out and also in fact I can cancel out is either the N
1723640~003440~there and seat to the end here
1727080~004719~and so what we're left with is a statement that tells us
1731799~003191~then dead the homogeneous
1734990~003090~solution is over for AC to the end
1738080~003940~for any ban you capital A and any value
1742020~003700~see it satisfies this equation and
1745720~003120~that values the in particular is the
1748840~003319~people today so the homogeneous solution then
1752159~004620~is any exponential this form with any amplitude factor
1756779~003890~and so the family of solutions with an impulse
1760669~003451~input is the solution
1764120~004460~corresponding to the system being cause a linear and time-invariant
1768580~003460~plus the homogeneous sir
1772040~000960~if
1773000~004000~we impose causality Lenny a ready in time invariance
1777000~003820~on the system then of course that additional
1780820~003690~exponential factor will be 0 in other words capital A
1784510~004069~is 0
1788579~004710~okay now in we seen the
1793289~002961~differential equations and difference equations interns
1796250~001720~love
1797970~003490~the fact there there are families have solutions
1801460~003630~and in order to get causality Lenny a ready in time
1805090~004420~variance requires imposing a particular set initial conditions namely
1809510~002960~imposing initial rest on the system
1812470~004569~let's now look at the difference equation
1817039~006161~and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagrams
1823200~003370~now p the difference equation at
1826570~003870~I just simply repeated here is why I have an
1830440~003260~is accident was a white van -1
1833700~003130~where I've taken that the late term
1836830~003810~over to the right hand side of the equation so in effect
1840640~003810~what on imposing on this system is causality
1844450~003000~I'm assuming that if I know the past history
1847450~003800~the input and the output I can determine
1851250~002710~the next value the out
1853960~003850~well we can in fact draw a block diagram
1857810~003690~represents that equation the equation says
1861500~003430~we take exit and for any given bad you
1864930~004460~a van say n0 whatever bad you were computing the output were
1869390~003480~we take the input at that time
1872870~003559~and and to it the factor a
1876429~005720~times the output value that we calculated last time so
1882149~004551~if we have excessive and which is our input
1886700~002980~and if we have why I have and which is our output
1889680~003960~we in fact can't get why I have an
1893640~003840~by taking the last value why event
1897480~003710~indicated here by putting why I have an
1901190~004260~threw it away multiplying Matt
1905450~003600~by the factor
1909050~002260~a
1911310~004770~and then Anning that result
1916080~001729~to
1917809~002151~the input
1919960~003240~and the result the doing that is
1923200~002260~why event
1925460~003040~so the way this block diagram
1928500~004559~might be interpreted for example as an algorithm is this a
1933059~004011~dead we take exit Van add to it
1937070~004960~eight times the previous value the output that some gives us
1942030~004350~the current value of the output which we then put out of the system
1946380~004060~and also put into a delay element or
1950440~004800~basically it was stored register to use on the next generation a recursion
1955240~004890~now how do we get this started well we know that the difference equation
1960130~001750~requires initial conditions
1961880~003049~and in fact the initial conditions
1964929~003551~correspond to what we store
1968480~003680~in that the late register when this block diagram
1972160~003160~equation initially starts up
1975320~003380~okay now let's look at
1978700~003620~this for the case %uh difference equations
1982320~004350~more generally
1986670~006610~so what we said is dead we can calculate the output by
1993280~003490~having previous values that the input
1996770~003670~previous values at the output and forming
2000440~004050~the appropriate linear combination so
2004490~003069~let's just build up the more general block diagram
2007559~004331~that would correspond to this
2011890~003840~and what it says is that we want to have a mechanism
2015730~005740~restoring past values the input in a mechanism for story past values at the
2021470~000520~output
2021990~003450~and i've indicated that on this figure
2025440~003190~so far by a chain love
2028630~003620~the layout its indicating
2032250~003140~that whatever what
2035390~003190~the output each delay is the input
2038580~003870~delayed by one time it's
2042450~003650~or or interval and so
2046100~004519~what we see down this chain of the ladies are the late replications
2050619~003581~love the input and what we see
2054200~003800~on the other chain is delayed
2058000~004940~replications love the output
2062940~004010~now the difference equation says that we want to take these
2066950~004219~and multiply them by the appropriate coefficients
2071169~003730~the coefficients in the difference equation and so we can do that
2074899~003571~as i've indicated here so
2078470~003540~now we have these delay elements each multiplied
2082010~004109~by the appropriate coefficients on the input and by
2086119~004970~appropriate coefficients on the output those are then
2091089~003490~songs together and
2094579~004571~so we now what's on these and what's on these
2099150~003610~after we've some these we want to add
2102760~004140~those together and there's a factor 1 over 80 that comes in
2106900~003250~and that and generates are out
2110150~003290~and so this in fact and
2113440~006139~represents a block diagram which is a general block diagram for implementing
2119579~003520~war representing near constant coefficient difference
2123099~001970~wage
2125069~004351~now if you think about what it means in terms of what's a computer algorithm or
2129420~001169~a piece of hardware
2130589~004101~in fact this block diagram is a recipe or algorithm for doing the
2134690~000990~implementation
2135680~003820~by it's important to
2139500~003540~recognize even at this point dad it's only one
2143040~004480~many possible algorithms or implementations for this difference
2147520~001480~wage
2149000~002369~just for example
2151369~005711~I can consider that equation
2157080~002270~core that block diagram
2159350~004710~and here I've redrawn at so
2164060~004110~here once again I have the same block diagram that we just saw
2168170~004570~and I can recognize for example
2172740~003620~that this in essence corresponds to
2176360~003210~to linear time-invariant systems
2179570~002640~in cascade
2182210~003210~now that assumes of course that my
2185420~004130~initial conditions are such dad I that the system is in fact
2189550~004660~when you're and that in turn requires that we're assuming initial rest namely
2194210~001870~before the input does anything
2196080~004610~other than 0 there are just zero value stored in the registers
2200690~004530~but assuming that it corresponds to a linear time-invariant system
2205220~005000~this is a cascade to linear time-invariant systems
2210220~003630~we know that two linear time-invariant systems can be cascaded
2213850~003640~in either order so in particular I can consider
2217490~003830~breaking this cascade here and moving this block
2221320~003570~over to the other side and so let's just
2224890~003770~do that
2228660~002380~and when I do
2231040~002069~I then have
2233109~003091~this combination systems
2236200~004010~and of course you can ask what advantage there is to do in at
2240210~003540~and the advantage arises because it the fact
2243750~003790~there'd in this form
2247540~004030~exactly what is stored in these delays
2251570~003210~is also stored in the still air registers
2254780~003510~in other words it's this intermediate variable
2258290~004350~whatever it is down this chain of delays and down this chain of the ladies
2262640~003940~and so in fact I can collapse those delays
2266580~003070~into a single chain of delays and
2269650~005330~the network that I'm left with is the network that I indicate
2274980~004280~I missed you graph where what I've done is to simply collapse that
2279260~003120~double chain of the ladies into a single chain
2282380~002240~the waves
2284620~004080~now want to ask well what's the advantage to doing that and the
2288700~000790~advantage
2289490~004800~one advantage simply stated is that when you think in terms of an implementation
2294290~001260~of a difference equation
2295550~003130~the lady corresponds to
2298680~003540~storage register a memory location and by this
2302220~003830~by simply using the fact that we can interchange the order in which linear
2306050~002130~time-invariant systems are cascaded
2308180~005260~we can reduce the amount of memory by a factor to
2313440~001890~okay now
2315330~005110~and essentially similar procedure can also be used for
2320440~004100~differential equations in terms of implementation
2324540~004120~using block diagrams for the interpretation implementations
2328660~003610~using like diagrams and let me first do that
2332270~003150~rather than in general let me first do it in the in
2335420~005500~the context love a specific example
2340920~001720~so
2342640~005610~let's consider a when your constant coefficient differential equation as
2348250~001240~i've indicated here
2349490~003830~and I have terms on the left side in terms on the right side
2353320~005090~and with the differential equation
2358410~003120~let's consider taking overturns
2361530~003259~over to the right side of the equation except
2364789~004861~for the highest the residue in the output next we
2369650~003159~integrate both sides of the equation are so that
2372809~003550~when we're done we end up with the on the left side of the equation
2376359~004760~with y ft on the right side of the equation with the appropriate number
2381119~003710~%uh integrations and so the InterPro equation
2384829~005141~that will get is for this example y ft the output is except the
2389970~003540~plus be the scale factor times the integral
2393510~004440~the input and -8 at scale factor times the integral
2397950~003020~the output so to
2400970~003450~form the output in a block diagram turns
2404420~003070~we form a linear combination of the input
2407490~003530~scaled in to grow the input and a scale
2411020~003099~integral love the output all of that and it together
2414119~003591~so we need in addition to
2417710~003589~the input we need the integral
2421299~003320~love the input and so this box indicates an integrator
2424619~003410~in addition to the output we need
2428029~003361~the integral the output and now
2431390~003560~to for why ft we
2434950~003079~multiply the integrated in play
2438029~004330~by the scale factor B and
2442359~004441~and back to exit C
2446800~004950~and retake the integrated output multiplied by Minas de
2451750~003530~and and to that
2455280~003320~the result are the previous addition
2458600~004340~and according to the integral equation then that forms
2462940~002280~the output
2465220~003310~so just as we did with the difference equation
2468530~003350~we've converted the differential equation to
2471880~004360~an integral equation and we have a block diagram for very similar
2476240~004500~to what we had in the case the difference equation now the initial
2480740~001310~conditions of course
2482050~003910~are tied up and again how these integrators
2485960~004670~are initialized assuming that we impose initial rest on the system
2490630~004480~weekend thinkers the overall system is a linear time-invariant system
2495110~004560~and it's a cascade one linear time-invariant system with the second
2499670~003400~so we can in fact
2503070~002580~break this
2505650~005470~and consider interchanging the order in which these two systems a cascade
2511120~003990~and so i've indicated that down below here
2515110~003560~I've simply taken the top block diagram
2518670~003820~interchange the order in which the to
2522490~003670~systems are cascaded and
2526160~003380~here again we can ask what the advantages to this
2529540~003770~as opposed to the previous one and what you can see
2533310~003310~just as we saw with the difference equation is that
2536620~003210~now the integrators both integrators
2539830~003040~are integrating the same thing in particular
2542870~004270~the input to this integrator and the input
2547140~004280~to this integrator are identical so in fact
2551420~003700~rather than using this one we can simply tap of
2555120~004550~from here we can in fact remove this integrator
2559670~002870~break this connection
2562540~003950~and happy and at this point and so
2566490~004220~what we've done and by interchange in the order in which the systems are
2570710~001000~cascaded
2571710~004400~is reduced the implementation to the implementation
2576110~003510~with a single integrated very much similar to
2579620~003330~what we talked about in the case the difference wage
2582950~003450~now let's just again with the integral equation
2586400~003920~way the differential equation looked at
2590320~003530~this somewhat more generally again
2593850~005080~if we take the differential equation the general differential equation
2598930~004400~integrated a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation
2603330~004240~we would then have this cascaded systems
2607570~004590~and again if we assume initial rest
2612160~003110~so that these are both linear time-invariant systems
2615270~003060~we can interchange the order in which they are cascaded
2618330~003980~namely take the second system and
2622310~002499~move it
2624809~003451~to proceed the first system
2628260~003720~and then we recognize is that the input to this change
2631980~004379~integrators and this change integrators is exactly the same
2636359~003521~and so in fact we can collapse these together
2639880~003800~using only one change integrators and the system
2643680~003730~there we're left with then is system
2647410~003300~that looks as i've indicated here so we have
2650710~003710~now just a single chain integrators
2654420~004070~is that a the two sets in
2658490~004570~so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case the
2663060~001170~difference equation
2664230~003920~again why do we want to cut the number integrators in half
2668150~005390~well one reason is because integrators in effect represent hardware
2673540~004170~and if we use half as much if we have half as many integrators
2677710~004080~then using half as much hard
2681790~003900~okay well let me just conclude by summarizing
2685690~003560~a number of points I indicated at the beginning
2689250~003980~that linear constant coefficient differential equations a difference
2693230~000890~equations
2694120~004650~will play an important role as linear time-invariant systems
2698770~004290~throughout this coursing throughout the center lectures
2703060~003050~I also stress
2706110~004250~the fact that differential or difference equations
2710360~003890~by themselves are not a complete specification
2714250~003670~the system because of the fact that we can and
2717920~004230~to any solution a homogeneous
2722150~003450~I do we specify the appropriate initial conditions
2725600~005040~to ensure how do we specify the appropriate initial conditions to ensure
2730640~001330~that the system
2731970~003030~is linear and time-invariant well
2735000~005670~the auxiliary information namely the initial conditions
2740670~003020~dissociated with the system
2743690~003350~be causal linear and time-invariant
2747040~003010~are the conditions of initial rest
2750050~003230~and in fact for most of the cores
2753280~004090~what will be interested in systems that are in fact cause a linear and
2757370~000960~time-invariant
2758330~005480~and so we will in fact be assuming initial rest conditions
2763810~002240~now
2766050~003020~as I also indicated their are
2769070~003420~a variety of efficient procedures for solving differential
2772490~004410~and difference equations that we haven't yet address and
2776900~003459~beginning with the next set of lectures will be talking about
2780359~003081~for EA transform and much later in the course
2783440~004270~what's referred to as the apostrophe its form for continuous-time
2787710~003609~and sea transport for discrete-time and what we'll see
2791319~005061~is that with the Fourier transform in later with the apostasy transform
2796380~004290~will have a number love efficient and very useful ways
2800670~004300~%uh generating the solution for
2804970~003960~differential and difference equations this under the assumption that the
2808930~001349~system is causal
2810279~002381~when you're in time very
2812660~004660~also will see in addition to the block diagram implementations
2817320~003170~the systems that we talked about so far
2820490~003830~we'll see another a number of other useful
2824320~004720~implementations that exploit a variety of properties associated with
2829040~002260~Korean past thank you
