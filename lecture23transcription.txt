033610~006409~the in
040019~007000~the new the
052780~005360~last time we began the discussion
058140~003089~love z transform and
061229~003661~as with the La Paz transforming continuous time we developed it
064890~004519~as a generalization of the Fourier transform the
069409~003551~expression that we got to dizzy transform is
072960~003909~the some that I indicate here and
076869~003881~we also briefly talked about and in Bercy transform
080750~003399~integral and some other informal methods
084149~003881~love computing the inverse eat transform but
088030~005470~we focused in particular on the relationship between busy transform
093500~003030~and the Fourier transform pointing out
096530~003460~first the ball dead busy transform
099990~003290~when we choose the magnitude is the
103280~003390~equal to 1 so the magnitude is the the for
106670~003970~you to the jail maker just simply reduces
110640~003219~to the 4e a transformer the sequence
113859~003561~then in addition we
117420~004420~explored busy transform foresee more general complex number
121840~003449~and in a discrete-time z transform case
125289~003601~we expressed that complex number in polar form
128890~003920~as our you DJ Omega and
132810~003820~recognized dead busy transform expression
136630~004750~in fact corresponds to the four EA transform
141380~004060~love the sequence exponentially weighted and
145440~003650~because I love the exponential weighting the
149090~003459~see transform converges for some
152549~003871~values of our corresponding to some exponential weighting
156420~003280~and perhaps not for others and that
159700~004259~led to a notion which corresponded to
163959~004741~the regional convergence associated with dizzy transform
168700~003819~and we talked some about properties in the region of convergence
172519~003580~particularly in relation to the poll 0
176099~004601~banner now the sea transform has
180700~004619~a number all important and useful properties just as the apostrophe s form
185319~000581~does
185900~004160~and as one part of this lecture what will want to do in fact
190060~005690~is exploit some of these properties in the context of systems described by with
195750~002299~your constant coefficient difference equations
198049~003631~the spur ticular properties said
201680~004919~play an important role in that context so the properties that I indicate year
206599~003401~and in particular their is as
210000~004189~with continuous time a linearity property that tells us
214189~004671~dead the busy transform a linear combination of sequences
218860~004230~in fact is the same linear combination of busy transforms
223090~003459~a shifting property that
226549~003071~indicates dead dizzy transform
229620~004030~Aug exit then shifted is busy transform
233650~004750~all exit then multiplied by a factor Z the -10 0
238400~003789~and then the convolution property
242189~003190~for which the z transform
245379~003401~all a convolution sequences is
248780~003709~the product all the associated see transforms
252489~003541~and with all of these properties
256030~004360~of course there is again the issue love what the Associated region of
260390~001140~convergence is
261530~003650~in comparison with the regional convergence the original sequences
265180~003470~and that is an issue this address
268650~003139~somewhat more in the text and let's not going to adhere
271789~003370~with the
275159~003621~convolution property the
278780~003439~convolution property as in continuous-time
282219~003771~course provides a mechanism for dealing
285990~003919~with linear time-invariant systems in particular
289909~003371~in the time domain a linear time-invariant system
293280~003530~is described through convolution namely
296810~003630~the output is the convolution love the input
300440~003630~and the impulse response because of the
304070~004700~convolution property associated with busy transform
308770~004910~z transform up the output is busy transformer the input
313680~003460~times the sea transform up the impulse response
317140~003019~and again very much the same as
320159~004430~what we had in continuous-time and also what we had
324589~004830~in the context that the discussion with the Fourier transform
329419~005831~in fact because if the relationship between busy transform the 48 transform
335250~004430~busy transform all the impulse response
339680~004900~evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude is equal to 1
344580~005470~in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system
350050~003080~more generally when we talk about this the transform
353130~004269~are the impulse response we will refer to it as
357399~005711~the system function associated with the system
363110~004010~now the convolution property in these other properties as i indicated
367120~004690~we will find useful in talking about systems which are described
371810~004330~by linear constant coefficient difference equations and in fact
376140~004000~will do that shortly but first what I'd like to do
380140~003139~is to continue
383279~003531~to focus on the system function
386810~003890~for linear time-invariant systems and make a couple comments
390700~004899~that tie back to some things that we said in the last lecture
395599~003731~relating to the relationship between
399330~003470~the region of convergence a system or
402800~004270~I'll I'm sorry the regional convergence a busy transform
407070~003969~and the issue of how that
411039~005271~where that is in relation to the holes a busy transport
416310~003359~now in particular we can draw some conclusions
419669~003601~flying back to that discussion about the
423270~004040~polo cations 0 the system function
427310~003630~in relation to weathered the system is
430940~004580~stable and whether the system is causal
435520~005370~in particular recall from one of the early lectures way back when
440890~003300~dead stability for a system
444190~004339~corresponded to the statement that the impulse response
448529~003861~is absolutely some local furthermore
452390~003230~when we talked about the Fourier transform
455620~003680~the Fourier transform all a sequence
459300~005190~converges if the sequence is absolutely some mobile
464490~003250~so in fact the condition for stability
467740~004270~and others I'll a system and the conditions for convergence in the
472010~002980~Fourier transform ovitz impulse response
474990~003299~in fact are the same condition namely
478289~003071~absolute some ability now
481360~003320~what does this mean what it means is dead
484680~003200~if the Fourier transform converges
487880~005730~that means that the z transform converges on the unit circle
493610~003059~consequently if the system is stable
496669~005071~then the system function z transform the impulse response
501740~003489~Moss also converge on the unit circle
505229~004300~in other words the impulse response must have a 48 transform
509529~003971~that converges soul for stable system
513500~004550~then the region of convergence the system function
518050~004549~must include the unit circle in the seaplane
522599~003561~so we see how stability relates
526160~003109~to the location all
529269~004721~the region of convergence and we can also relate causality
533990~003710~to the region of convergence in particular we know
537700~003440~dead if system is causal
541140~004889~than the impulse response is right sided
546029~003051~for sequences right-sided the regional convergence
549080~006009~love it see transform must be outside the outermost poll
555089~004370~so for causality the regional convergence services to function must be
559459~002250~outside the outermost poll
561709~005000~for stability the regional convergence must include the unit circle
566709~004471~and in fact we can also then draw from at the conclusion
571180~003659~dead if we have a system its causal unstable
574839~004000~than all polls must be inside the unit circle
578839~004021~because of the fact that the polls must because the fact that the region of
582860~001529~convergence must be
584389~005521~outside the outermost poll and has to also include the unit circle
589910~003219~soul for example if we had
593129~004390~let's say system with a system function
597519~006451~as I indicate here
603970~003960~with the algebraic expression for the system function
607930~005630~being the expression that I indicate here with a pole at sequels a third
613560~004750~and another poll as equals to an 8-0 at the origin
618310~003129~if in fact the system
621439~005140~was causal corresponding to an impulse response that's right sided
626579~004771~this then would be the region of convergence
631350~003859~the system function alternatively
635209~003870~if I knew that the system was stable then I know that
639079~003731~the region of convergence must include the unit circle and so
642810~003839~this would be then the region of convergence
646649~004680~and what you might now want to ask yourselves
651329~003791~is if instead the region of convergence
655120~003560~for the system function is this there and
658680~004009~is the system causal first question
662689~003640~second question is is the system stable
666329~004050~remembering that for causality the regional convergence must be outside the
670379~001380~outermost poll
671759~004390~and for stability must include the unit circle
676149~003651~all right now what I'd like to do is
679800~003469~look at the properties
683269~003101~love the z transform
686370~005089~and in particular exploit these properties in the context systems
691459~005120~that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations
696579~004740~and the three basic properties that play a key role in that discussion
701319~003091~are the linearity property
704410~004339~shifting property and the convolution property
708749~003690~and and so the stand are the properties
712439~003541~dead I want to exploit so
715980~003180~let's do that by first looking at a
719160~004010~first-order difference equation and in the case
723170~003099~love a first-order difference equation which
726269~005260~I've written as i indicate year no turns on the right hand side but we could have
731529~002091~terms of course in general
733620~003969~so why am i sayi van -1 equals x seven
737589~004990~and we can use the linearity property
742579~005120~so that if we take this the transformer both sides have this expression
747699~005791~that will then be busy transformer this term plus the transformer this term
753490~003170~and so using those properties
756660~004690~and together with the shifting property
761350~003229~the property that tells us that the Z transform I'll
764579~005870~y ven -1 is see to the -1 times the transformer y ven
770449~004921~we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression
775370~003500~and we can solve this outbreak expression for
778870~003629~busy transform up the output in terms of
782499~003560~busy transformer the input
786059~004450~now what we know from the convolution property
790509~005861~is that for system the the chance for the output is the system function times
796370~002019~the transformer the input
798389~003200~so this factor that we have then
801589~003081~must correspond to the
804670~003339~system function or equivalent Lee
808009~004171~busy transform of the impulse response the system
812180~004540~and in fact then if we have this the transform we could figure out
816720~003270~what the impulse response that the system is
819990~005199~by computing or determining what the inverse the transformants
825189~004031~except for the fact that that expression
829220~003369~is an algebraic expression and
832589~004131~doesn't yet totally specified dizzy transform because we don't yet know what
836720~003500~the region of convergence is
840220~004510~how do we get the regional convergence well we have the same issue here as we
844730~002219~have with the apostrophe in swarm
846949~004521~namely the point dead difference equation
851470~005299~tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is
856769~005290~for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence
862059~003690~that is specified by either explicitly
865749~004351~because it's one way or another we know with the impulse responses
870100~004729~or implicitly because we know certain properties in the system
874829~004670~such as causality and/or stability
879499~003070~so if on a
882569~005101~let's say a imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation
887670~007000~the condition all causality
894779~003670~then what that requires is dead the impulse
898449~003070~response the right-sided or
901519~003641~the region of convergence be outside the outermost poll
905160~003429~and so for this example that would require then
908589~003500~that the region of convergence correspond to
912089~006160~the magnitude is Z greater than the magnitude a
918249~004650~what you might think about is whether I would get the same condition
922899~004120~if I required instead that the system
927019~004461~be stable and furthermore you could think about the question of whether I
931480~000930~could
932410~004659~specify or impose on this system that if the boat stable in causal
937069~003560~the real issue let me just kind of point to it is dead
940629~003120~the answer to those questions relate to
943749~004390~whether the magnitude a vase less than 1 with a magnitude is greater than one
948139~003901~if the magnitude have a is less than one and I specify causality
952040~003320~that will also mean
955360~003139~that the system is stable in any case
958499~003661~given this region of convergence then the
962160~005149~impulse response is the inverse transformer that see transform which is
967309~003921~a to the end times you there
971230~006229~right now let's look at second order equation is a very similar strategy
977459~003320~for the second-order equation the one that I picked is
980779~003100~love this particular form and I've written
983879~004351~the coefficients parametrically as i indicate here for a specific reason
988230~004310~which will see shortly again I can apply this the transform
992540~003799~to this expression and I've skipped
996339~004021~an algebraic stepper to hear when I do this then
1000360~004219~again you I use the when you're ready property and a shifting property
1004579~003320~and I end up with this algebraic expression
1007899~004310~if I now solve that to express why if the
1012209~003690~in terms of exits the and a function of Z
1015899~005141~then this is what I get for the system function
1021040~003180~and in so this is now
1024220~004800~a second-order system function and will have 20 that the origin
1029020~003919~and it will have two poles
1032939~003351~again and there's the question 0
1036290~004090~what we assume about the regional convergence I haven't specified date yet
1040380~003130~but if we let's say assume that
1043510~004210~the reach dead the system is causal which I will tend to do
1047720~002900~then that means that the region of convergence is outside the outermost
1050620~002200~poll
1052820~003590~now where the polls well let me just kinda vindicate
1056410~004800~dad if and you can verify this algebraically
1061210~003190~I actually Jer dead
1064400~003340~if the cosine beta term
1067740~003350~is less than 1
1071090~003380~then the roots of this polynomial
1074470~003510~will be complex and in fact the polls
1077980~004620~are at are eat a plus or minus J theta
1082600~003390~soul for Cosi pay to less than 1% then
1085990~003680~the polls are complex and
1089670~003580~the complex polls at an angle theta and
1093250~004420~with a distance from the origin equal to the parameter are
1097670~003020~so in fact let's just look at that
1100690~003290~and what I show here is the
1103980~003660~poll 0 pattern
1107640~004110~assuming that are is less than one
1111750~003960~and that cosine data is less than one
1115710~003970~and we have a complex poll pair shown here
1119680~003660~and now if we we assume that the system was causal
1123340~004170~that means that the region of convergence is outside these polls
1127510~003130~and that would then include the unit circle
1130640~003420~which means that the system is also stable
1134060~004350~and in fact as long as the region of convergence includes the unit circle
1138410~003300~we can also talk about the
1141710~004240~frequency response of the system namely we can evaluate the system function
1145950~004080~on the unit circle and we in fact evaluated
1150030~003960~the forty a transform associated with this
1153990~004050~polls 0 pattern last time and recalled that
1158040~003740~the frequency response then is one that has
1161780~003930~a resident character with the resonant peak
1165710~003360~being roughly in the the sanity love
1169070~003540~the angle of the Polo cation
1172610~003870~and as the parameter are very slight Cesar get smaller
1176480~003110~this peak 10's to broaden as our
1179590~007000~gets closer to one the residence tends to get sharp
1187930~003190~alright well this is now
1191120~005580~can a job look at busy transform and we see very strong parallels to the
1196700~002310~low-cost rents form
1199010~003360~in fact throughout the course
1202370~003230~I tried to emphasize and it just naturally happens
1205600~003360~that there are very strong relationships
1208960~004920~and parallels between continuous-time and discrete-time
1213880~003500~and in fact at one point we
1217380~005410~specifically map from continuous I discrete time when we talked about
1222790~004260~discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals
1227050~003870~and what I'd like to do now is turn our attention
1230920~004270~to another very important reason
1235190~004220~for mapping from continuous-time to discrete-time
1239410~003960~and in the process of doing this what will need to do is exploit
1243370~004150~fairly heavily the insight into wishin
1247520~003340~and procedures that we've developed for
1250860~004280~the La Paz transform and easy transport
1255140~004390~specifically what I would like to begin is a discussion
1259530~004190~relating to mapping continuous-time
1263720~004660~filters to discrete-time filters
1268380~003440~or continuous-time system functions to
1271820~003160~discrete-time system functions now
1274980~003290~why would we want to do that well their
1278270~004070~are at least several reasons for wanting to Mac continuous-time
1282340~005420~filters to discrete-time filters one of course is the fact that
1287760~003460~in some situations what we're interested in
1291220~003750~doing is processing continuous-time signals
1294970~004030~with discrete-time systems or
1299000~004100~said another way simulate continuous-time
1303100~003450~systems with discrete-time systems
1306550~004440~and so would be natural in a setting like that to think a mapping the
1310990~003250~the desired continuous I filter to a discrete-time
1314240~004250~told so that's one very important context
1318490~003250~is another very important context in which
1321740~003160~this is done and then is in the con- it
1324900~003370~or in the in the context or
1328270~003270~for the purpose all exploiting
1331540~004610~establish design procedures for continuous five filters
1336150~003620~the point is the following: we may or may not
1339770~003590~be processing it a sample continuous-time signal with our
1343360~003420~discrete-time salter maybe just be discrete-time signals that we're working
1346780~000650~with
1347430~004260~but in that situation
1351690~006590~still we need to design the appropriate discreet I filter
1358280~003820~historically their is a very
1362100~003180~rich history
1365280~004350~associated with design a continuous-time filters
1369630~003350~and in many cases it's possible
1372980~003660~and very worthwhile and efficient to
1376640~003260~take those designs and map dome
1379900~004980~to discrete-time designs to use them as discrete time filters
1384880~004960~so another very important reason for talking about the kinds mappings there
1389840~001990~we will be going into
1391830~004780~is this simply take advantage I love what has been done historically
1396610~005010~in the continuous-time case
1401620~003060~all right now if we want to map
1404680~004080~continuous I filters to discrete-time filters
1408760~004910~then in continuous-time we're talking about a system function
1413670~003600~and an associated differential equation
1417270~004300~and indiscreet I'm there is the corresponding
1421570~003850~system function and the corresponding
1425420~003560~difference equation and
1428980~003380~basically what we want to do is generate
1432360~003650~from a continuous-time system
1436010~003600~in some way a discrete-time system that
1439610~006020~meets in dissociated set ok desired specifications
1445630~003540~now there's certain constraints that its
1449170~003480~reasonable an important to impose on
1452650~003190~whatever kinds mappings we use
1455840~005040~obviously wanna mapping that will take are continuous-time system function
1460880~004480~and map it to a discrete-time system function correspondingly in the time
1465360~000800~domain
1466160~004120~their is a continuous-time impulse response
1470280~005330~that maps to the Associated discrete-time impulse response
1475610~004120~these are more less natural the two that are important and
1479730~005740~sometimes easy to lose sight of are the two that I indicate here
1485470~004580~in particular if we r mapping
1490050~004610~a continuous-time filter with let's say a desire desirable
1494660~003150~frequency response to a discrete-time
1497810~005240~filter and we would like to preserve the good qualities that frequency response
1503050~005000~as we look at the discrete-time frequency response
1508050~003200~then it's important that
1511250~004800~what happens in the ass plane for the continues type filter along the jail
1516050~001810~make axis
1517860~003010~relate in a nice way to what happens
1520870~003120~in the seaplane around the unit circle
1523990~003810~because it's this over here
1527800~003450~that represents the frequency response in continuous-time
1531250~004190~and this contour over here that represents the frequency response
1535440~003150~in discrete-time so that's an important property we want
1538590~003350~have the J Omega axis to map
1541940~003240~to the unit circle another
1545180~003430~more less natural condition to impose
1548610~003160~is a condition that if we
1551770~004640~are assured in some way that our continuous type filter is stable
1556410~005560~then we would like to concentrate on design procedures that
1561970~005580~more or less preserved at and will give us stable digital filters
1567550~005450~so these are are reasonable conditions to impose on the procedure
1573000~004370~and what I'd like to do in the remainder this lecture is look at
1577370~006040~to common procedures for mapping continuous-time filters to discrete-time
1583410~003010~filters the first one that I
1586420~004870~want to talk about is one that in fact is very frequently use
1591290~003170~and also one
1594460~003320~that as we'll see for a variety of reasons is
1597780~004050~highly undesirable the second
1601830~003930~is one that is also frequently used and as we'll see
1605760~004040~is arm in certain situations very desirable
1609800~003020~the first one i wanna talk about is
1612820~003040~the more less intuitive simple
1615860~003770~procedure 0 mapping a difference equation at
1619630~003680~differential equation to a difference equation by
1623310~003530~simply replacing derivatives by
1626840~004300~differences and kinda the idea is that it
1631140~003750~a derivative is more or less a difference and there's some dummy
1634890~002780~parameter capital T that I've thrown in here which
1637670~004720~I won't focus too much on but in any case
1642390~004720~this seems to have some plausibility if we take the differential equation and do
1647110~001670~this with all the derivatives
1648780~003240~on both in terms of wife tnx ft
1652020~004530~what we'll end up with is a difference equation
1656550~003680~now what we can use are the properties
1660230~004240~love the boss transforming dizzy transform
1664470~004490~to see what this means in terms of a mapping a particular
1668960~003430~using a different ciation property from a plus transforms
1672390~004050~in the a-plus transform domain we would have this
1676440~003590~using the properties for
1680030~004530~busy transform busy transformer this expression would be this
1684560~003140~and so in effect what it says
1687700~003040~is dead every place in the system function
1690740~003720~or the differential equation that we would be multiplying by S
1694460~003530~when we'll pass transformed in the difference equation we would be
1697990~002210~multiplying by this factor
1700200~004000~so in fact what this means is that
1704200~004750~the mapping from continuous time to discrete-time
1708950~004650~corresponds to taking the system function
1713600~003790~and replacing s wherever we see it
1717390~004260~by one minus the to the -1 over capital T
1721650~004790~and so if we have a system function in continuous-time
1726440~003110~and we map it to a discrete-time system function
1729550~003510~this way by replacing derivatives by differences
1733060~004210~then that corresponds to replacing asked by
1737270~004110~$1 -2 -1 over capital T
1741380~003970~now we'll see shortly what this mapping
1745350~004230~actually means more specifically in relating yes plane to the seaplane
1749580~003070~let me just quickly because I want to refer to this
1752650~005160~also point to another procedure very much like backward differences
1757810~003830~which corresponds to replacing derivatives not by the backward
1761640~001510~difference is that I just showed
1763150~003550~but by former differences and in that case
1766700~004670~then the mapping corresponds replacing asked by
1771370~004420~Zeta minus one over capital T
1775790~003480~looks very similar to the previous case and
1779270~004100~so there the relationship between the system functions
1783370~003370~is what I indicate here
1786740~003750~alright well let's just take a look at
1790490~005230~what that those mappings correspond to when we look at this specifically
1795720~003560~in the S plane and in the seaplane brown
1799280~003630~what I show here is the s plane
1802910~005340~and chorus its things in the left after the S plane posing left after the s plan
1808250~001590~that would guarantee stability
1809840~006720~its the chair make axis that tells us about the frequency response
1816560~003280~and in the seaplane its
1819840~004220~the unit circle that tells us about the frequency response
1824060~003920~and things inside the unit circle or poles inside the unit circle to
1827980~002170~guarantee stability
1830150~005190~now the mapping from yes point to the sea plane corresponding
1835340~003980~to replacing derivatives by backward differences
1839320~003690~in fact can be shown to correspond
1843010~003910~to mapping DJ Omega axis
1846920~003390~not to the unit circle but
1850310~004930~to the little circle that I show here which is inside the unit circle
1855240~005210~the left half oath the S plane maps to the insider that circle
1860450~003020~what does that mean that means they had if we have
1863470~003010~a really good frequency response
1866480~003020~characteristic along this contour
1869500~003790~in the S plane will see that same frequency response
1873290~003690~along this little circle that's not the one we want though
1876980~004750~we would like to see that same frequency response around the unit circle
1881730~005240~to emphasize this point even more suppose for example
1886970~003440~that we had appear polls
1890410~005590~in our continuous-time system function that look like this
1896000~003260~then where they're likely to end up
1899260~003350~in busy plane is
1902610~003890~inside the unit circle of course by if
1906500~003370~the polls here are close to the jail make axis
1909870~004070~that means that these polls will be close to this circle
1913940~003420~but in fact might be very far away from the unit circle
1917360~003220~so what would happen then is dead
1920580~005130~if we saw in the continuous-time filter very sharp residence
1925710~003690~the discrete-time filter in fact might very well have that residents broadened
1929400~001010~considerably
1930410~004090~because the polls is so far away from the unit circle
1934500~003370~now 1 plus
1937870~003090~with this method and it's about the only one
1940960~003630~is the fact that the left after the S plane
1944590~005950~maps inside the unit circle in fact inside the circle inside the unit circle
1950540~003330~and so stability is always guarantee
1953870~002980~let me just quickly mention and you'll have a chance to look at this a little
1956850~001380~more carefully in the
1958230~003370~video course manual dead for
1961600~003400~forward difference is that a backward differences
1965000~004060~this contour and yes plane
1969060~004020~maps to a line in the seaplane
1973080~004800~which is online tangent to the unit circle
1977880~003220~and in fact is the line that I show their
1981100~003790~so not only are for differences
1984890~003730~equally bad and turns at the issue whether they mapped from the chair may
1988620~002220~get access to the unit circle
1990840~004320~but they have further difficulty associated with them
1995160~003020~which is the difficulty dead
1998180~006630~they may not and generally don't guarantee stability
2004810~003580~right now that's one method and
2008390~004010~I'll one as i indicated that so often use partly
2012400~004910~I am a because it seems so intuitively plausible
2017310~004480~and what you can see is that by understand it carefully the issues and
2021790~002330~the techniques of apostasy transforms
2024120~003740~you can begin to see what some of the difficulties with that method
2027860~003550~for those methods are the next method
2031410~004320~dad I'd like to talk about is a method that in fact is very
2035730~003480~commonly used and it's a very important useful method
2039210~005350~which Chynoweth can be motivated by thinking along the lines of both
2044560~003490~mapping the continuous-time filter to
2048050~004349~a discrete-time sold their in such a way
2052399~004230~dead the shape up the impulse response is preserved
2056629~004131~and in fact more specifically so that
2060760~003730~the discrete-time impulse response corresponds to
2064490~004490~samples love the continuous-time impulse response
2068980~003060~and this is a method that's referred to as
2072040~003230~in polls invariance
2075270~004099~so what imposing variance corresponds to
2079369~003250~is designing the filter in such a way
2082619~003470~that the discrete-time filter
2086089~003160~impulse response is simply
2089249~005080~sample version love the continuous type filter impulse response
2094329~006071~with a sampling period which I do know here's capital T
2100400~004419~and that will turn into a slightly confusing parameter
2104819~003210~shortly and perhaps carried over into the next lecture
2108029~003161~and hopefully we'll get that straightened out though
2111190~003629~within those two lectures now remembering
2114819~003871~the issues of sampling the discrete-time
2118690~004589~frequency response then since the frequency response is the forty a
2123279~002500~transformer the impulse response
2125779~005961~is related to the continuous-time impulse responses I indicate here
2131740~004839~and what this says is that it is
2136579~003040~the superposition
2139619~006970~all replications love the continuous high frequency response
2146589~003811~linearly scaled in frequency and
2150400~004270~shifted and added to each other it's the same old
2154670~003560~are so shifting ending a really is saying issued the same sampling issues
2158230~002809~that we've addressed before
2161039~004111~well this equation will help us understand what the frequency response
2165150~001179~looks like
2166329~003311~but in terms of an analytical procedure
2169640~004060~for mapping the continuous-time system function
2173700~003299~to a discrete-time system function we can see
2176999~005211~dat and develop it in the following way:
2182210~003940~let's consider the continuous-time system function
2186150~004090~expanded in a partial fraction expansion
2190240~004190~and just for convenience on picking first-order polls this can be
2194430~004909~general generalized or rather single polls this can be generalized
2199339~004020~to on multiple order polls
2203359~004841~and we won't do that here the same basic strategy applies
2208200~004450~if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion
2212650~004230~and we look at the impulse response associated with this
2216880~003090~we know how to take the inverse Laplace transform with this
2219970~005520~where I'm just naturally assume because our the throughout the discussion
2225490~003079~the continuous-time impulse response then is
2228569~004210~someone exponentials with these amplitudes
2232779~005121~and at these complex exponential frequencies
2237900~003689~now impulse in various corresponds to sampling this
2241589~003940~and so the discrete-time impulse response
2245529~003470~is simply a sample version of this and
2248999~003760~in the AC cave course carries down
2252759~006451~and we have the exponential were sampling at Eagles and capital T and so
2259210~003599~we've replaced that here and then the unit step
2262809~003240~to truncate things for negative time
2266049~003351~right well let's manipulate this further and
2269400~003909~eventually what we want to get is relationship mapping
2273309~003700~from the continuous-time to the discrete-time filter
2277009~004600~so we had this staff that we can rewrite that
2281609~003740~now as I show here just
2285349~003980~simply taking this and outside we have EDS
2289329~003901~k capital T so now this is %uh the for
2293230~003129~the summer terms like a suitcase me
2296359~005710~times fated to the N we can compute is a transformer this
2302069~003871~and busy transform the week at I show
2305940~003500~here it's simply a sieve K over one minus
2309440~003319~in the s2k capital T see the -1
2312759~003490~simply carrying this term or this
2316249~003481~this parameter down
2319730~004970~so we started with a continuous-time system function which was the sole turns
2324700~005000~like a sieve K over s minus SFK the polls were tested K
2329700~004020~we now have the day that discrete I filter in this form
2333720~004730~and consequently then this procedure in Polson variance
2338450~003549~corresponds to
2341999~003661~mapping the continuous I filter to discrete-time filter
2345660~004409~by mapping the polls in the continuous I filter
2350069~004081~according to this mapping
2354150~006379~the continuous part filter poll and SFK gets map topo edited the s2k capital T
2360529~003330~and the coefficients a suitcase
2363859~003210~a are preserve
2367069~004621~and that an algebraically is what the procedure of impulse and variance
2371690~001889~corresponds to
2373579~003690~okay well let's look at
2377269~004421~how we interpret summer this in the frequency domain
2381690~003169~and in particular
2384859~004920~we have the expression that tells us how the
2389779~003421~discrete-time frequency response
2393200~004270~is related to the continuous-time frequency response
2397470~004079~this is the expression that we had previously
2401549~003790~when we have talked about issues of sampling
2405339~004051~so that means that we would form the discrete I frequency response
2409390~003500~by taking the continuous-time one scaling it
2412890~004070~in frequency according to this parameter capital T
2416960~004230~and then Anne replications that together
2421190~003899~so if this is the continuous-time
2425089~004831~frequency response just simply an idea low-pass filter with the cutoff
2429920~001270~frequency of omega-6
2431190~003240~see van the its
2434430~004649~frequency scaling operation would keep the same basic shape
2439079~005631~but but linearly scale the frequency axis so that we now have Omega sexy
2444710~002220~times capital T
2446930~004629~and then the discrete-time frequency response
2451559~003710~would be a superposition at these and it together
2455269~004470~at multiples of 2 pie indiscreet time-frequency
2459739~003580~and so that's what we have here
2463319~004851~so this is the discreet I frequency response
2468170~004270~so this looks very nice it looks like in Polson variance will
2472440~003609~take the continuous I frequency response just simply
2476049~005151~linearly scale the frequency axis and incidently periodically repeated
2481200~005510~we know that for an idea low-pass filter that looks just fine and in fact
2486710~004559~for a ban limited frequency response that looks just fine
2491269~004500~but we know also that anytime that were sampling
2495769~003881~here with sampling the impulse response we have
2499650~004270~in effect in the frequency domain where the potential for a second effect
2503920~003810~dead we refer to as alias so in fact
2507730~003889~if instead of the ideal low-pass filter
2511619~005720~we had taken a filter that was an approximation to a low pass filter
2517339~004000~then the corresponding frequency scale version
2521339~005770~would look as I've shown here and now as we add these together
2527109~003811~then what we will have is some potential
2530920~003250~for distortion corresponding to the fact that
2534170~003109~these replications overlap and
2537279~005040~what that will lead to is aliasing
2542319~003980~so some things that we can say about imposing variance
2546299~003581~is there yet we have an algebraic procedure at all
2549880~004419~illustrate with another example shortly for taking a continuous I've system
2554299~001871~function mapping it to a discrete-time
2556170~005819~system function it has a very nice property in terms of both
2561989~003290~a %uh mapping the mapping from
2565279~003631~the frequency axis in continuous-time the to the
2568910~003280~unit circle namely
2572190~003530~to a first approximation as long as there's no aliasing
2575720~005399~the mapping is just simply a linear scaling the frequency axis although
2581119~003890~there may be some alias saying that means of course that this method can
2585009~001631~only be used
2586640~004979~if the frequency response that's being mapped work the system is being mad
2591619~004180~has a frequency response that's approximately low-pass had asked to be
2595799~002851~approximately ban limit
2598650~003189~and then what we have is some
2601839~004690~pop potential distortion which comes about because bailey's
2606529~004101~also because if the mapping the fact that polls at soka
2610630~005209~get map to polls at you to the s2k capital T
2615839~003321~if the analog a continuous-time filter is
2619160~003899~stable meaning that the real party Vesta case is negative
2623059~004200~then the discrete types author is guaranteed to be stable
2627259~003090~in other words the magnitude as the suitcase a
2630349~005150~will be guaranteed to be less than 1 I'm assuming of course that discussion
2635499~005550~we're are always imposing causality and systems
2641049~004480~Bardwell to just look at the algebraic mapping
2645529~004121~a little more carefully let's take a simple example
2649650~003589~here is an example all
2653239~003491~a system a continuous-time system where
2656730~003650~I simply have a resident poll pair
2660380~003449~with a real with an imaginary part along the
2663829~003881~Majuri accessible make it so far a real part of mine a South
2667710~005039~for and so The Associated system function and
2672749~004280~is just the expression which incorporates
2677029~005830~the two poles and I put in a scale factor to Omega so far
2682859~003240~and now to design the discrete-time
2686099~003920~filter using in Polson variance you carry out a partial fraction expansion
2690019~001671~of this
2691690~004299~and that partial fraction expansion is shown below
2695989~004270~we have a pole at minus South a-minus J Omega are and at minus alpha plus Chi
2700259~001860~Omega are
2702119~003140~and to determine the
2705259~003211~discrete-time filter based on imposing variance
2708470~003990~we would map the polls and preserves the coefficients a Sat K
2712460~003609~referred to as the residues and so the
2716069~004480~discrete-time filter that we would end up with
2720549~003780~as system function which I indicate
2724329~003381~here and we have is a
2727710~003039~said preserve the residue and
2730749~003320~the poll is now at either minus out the TE
2734069~004391~you the vice chair makes a party that's one term
2738460~005159~and the other term in Assam has a pole at the complex conjugate
2743619~003650~location if we were to add these to
2747269~003361~factors together then what we would get
2750630~003300~is both polls and
2753930~003460~0 at the origin and
2757390~004949~in fact then the poll is defined by
2762339~003071~its angle and this angle
2765410~003250~is is
2768660~003329~eat see the J Omega so far
2771989~004181~capital see and by its radius
2776170~003460~and this radius is eat to the minors
2779630~004129~alpha capital T
2783759~003790~all right now we can look at the frequency response
2787549~004151~associated with that and and let's just do that
2791700~003109~for the original
2794809~005161~continuous-time frequency response
2799970~004210~what we have is simply a resident character is a show
2804180~004010~as shown here and if we
2808190~003770~map this using your post in various which we just did
2811960~003020~the resulting frequency response
2814980~004710~that we get is the frequency response which I indicate
2819690~003069~we see that that's basically identical
2822759~004080~to the continuous-time frequency response
2826839~005291~except for by a linear scaling the frequency axis if you just compare
2832130~004879~the the dimensions along which the frequency axis is shown
2837009~004181~and for one except for one minor
2841190~003730~issue which we switch is particularly highlighted
2844920~005270~when we look at the frequency response at higher frequencies
2850190~003690~what's the reason why those two curves
2853880~005090~don't quite follow each other at higher frequencies
2858970~004099~well the reason is aliasing other words what's happened
2863069~003371~is dead the in the process I'll
2866440~003409~applying in polls and variance the
2869849~003640~frequency response the original continuous-time filter
2873489~004070~is approximately preserved except for some distortion
2877559~003821~thats ocean correspondent aliasing
2881380~004270~well just for comparison let's look at what
2885650~004209~would happen if we took the same example and when I can work it through here
2889859~000740~carefully
2890599~004520~waco work through it all not even accurately
2895119~003370~if we took the same example and mapped it
2898489~006110~to a discrete-time filter by replacing the rivet is by backward differences
2904599~003561~what happens in that case is dead we get
2908160~003329~frequency response that I indicate
2911489~003721~here and notice dat the resonance
2915210~003220~in the original continuous-time filter is
2918430~003659~totally lost in fact
2922089~003150~basically the character love the continuous-time
2925239~003201~frequency responses los what's the reason
2928440~003339~well the reason goes back to the picture that I drew before
2931779~003470~the continuous-time filter had a
2935249~005540~pair love resident polls close to the jail may axis
2940789~003730~when those get mapped using back with differences they end up close to this
2944519~003290~little circle that's inside the unit circle
2947809~006631~but in fact for this example are far away from the unit circle
2954440~003730~alright so so far we have
2958170~004210~one useful technique for mapping continuous I filters to discrete-time
2962380~005879~filters and apart to highlights are the issues I focused attention also
2968259~003490~on some not so useful methods
2971749~005870~namely mapping derivatives to forward or backward differences
2977619~003650~next time what I would like to do
2981269~003191~is look at impulse invariance
2984460~003720~for another example namely the design
2988180~003179~0 a Butterworth filter and all
2991359~003571~talk more specifically about what butterworth filters or
2994930~003879~at the beginning that lecture and then in addition
2998809~004141~what will introduce is another very useful technique
3002950~004710~which has some difficulties which imposed and variance doesn't have
3007660~003629~but avoids the principal
3011289~003651~difficulty that impulse in various does have namely aliasing
3014940~004359~admitted is referred to as the violin you transformation
3019299~003341~which we will to find and
3022640~001699~utilize next time thank you
