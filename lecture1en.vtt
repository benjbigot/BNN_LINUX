00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ha the the

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the norm

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
well

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the I'm out oppenheim

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and I'd like to welcome you to this video tape course on signals and systems

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
signals at least

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
as an informal definition are functions

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
one or more independent variables that

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
typically carry some type information systems in

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
are setting with typically be used the process signals

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
one very common example of a signal

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
might be let's say speech signal and you might think

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
love the air pressure as a function of time

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or perhaps the electrical signal effort goes through the microphone

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
transducer is a function of time as representing the speech signal

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and we might see a typical speech signal

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
looking something like i've indicated here

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
its a function time

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in this particular case and the independent variable

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
being time is in fact continuous

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and so a signal like this we will typically be referring to

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as a continuous-time signals now

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it also for this particular example is a function

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
one independent variable and

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that will be referred to as

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the one dimensional signal

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
corresponding to the fact that there's only

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
one independent variable several independent variables

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so the speech signal is an example

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
a continuous-time one-dimensional signal

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
now signals can of course

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
be multi-dimensional and they may not have as their independent variables time

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
variables

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
one very common example are

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the examples represented by images images

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
as signals we might think I'll as

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
representing brightness as it varies

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
in a horizontal and vertical

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
direction and so the brightness as a function

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
these two spatial variables is then

00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a two-dimensional signal and

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it the independent variables

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
would typically be continuous but of course they're not time variables

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and incidently it's worth

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
just commenting very often simply for convenience

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
will have a tendency to refer to the independent variables when we talk about

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
signals

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
as time variables whether or not the really represent time

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
well let me illustrate

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
one example all image and

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
this is a picture jpg for EA

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
who perhaps more than anyone else

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
is responsible for the elegance and beauty

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
a lot of the concepts we'll be talking about throughout this course

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and when you look at this in addition to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
c4a himself you should recognize that what you're looking at

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is basically a signal which is brightness as a function

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the horizontal and vertical spatial variables

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
as another example

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
an image as a signal let's look at an aerial photograph

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
this is an aerial photograph taken

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
over a setter roads which

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you can more less recognized in the picture and

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
wanted the difficulties with this signal is that it

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the road system is somewhat obscured by cloud cover

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and well wanna show later

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
as an example what a system

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
might do to such as signal in terms of processing is an attempt to

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
at least compensate some way for the

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
cloud cover represented in the photograph following terms a

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the detailed analysis we go through during the course are

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
focus of attention is pretty much restricted to

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
one-dimensional signals in fact we will be using

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
two-dimensional signals more specifically images

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
very often to illustrate a variety

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
concepts now

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
speech in images are examples

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
what we refer to as continuous-time signals

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
in that they are functions

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
continuous variables equally

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
important classes signals will be concentrating on

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in the cores are signals are

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
discrete-time signals

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
where by discrete-time we mean

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is that the signal is

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
a function integer variable

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and so specifically only takes on values

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
at in nature values the argument

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so here is a graphical illustration

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the discrete-time signal and discrete-time signals arise

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in a variety of ways one very common example

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
it seems fairly often is discrete-time signals in the context

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
economic time series and for example stock market analysis

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
so what I show here is one

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
very commonly occurring example the discrete-time signal

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it represents the weekly stock market index

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the independent variable in this case is

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the week number and we see what the

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
stock market is doing over this particular period

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
as a function or the number of the week and

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
course along the vertical axis is the

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
weekly index incidently

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
this particular period was not chosen

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
random in fact captures very interesting aspect

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
stock market history namely the

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
stock market crash in 1929

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
which in fact is represented by behavior

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
this discrete time signal or sequence

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in this particular area so this dramatic dip in fact

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
is the stock market crash 1929

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
well the dow jones weekly average is an example

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
all a one-dimensional discrete-time signal

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and just as with continuous time

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
we had not just one-dimensional multi-dimensional signals

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
likewise we have multi-dimensional signals

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in the discrete-time case where

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
in that case then the discrete-time signal that we're talking about a

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
sequence

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is a function love to integer variables

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and is one example this might let's say represent a spatial

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
antenna array where this is

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
array number in let's say the horizontal

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
direction and this is array number in the vertical direction

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
both classes signals continuous-time and discrete-time

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
as i've indicated are very important and it should be emphasized

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
dead the importance I'll discrete-time signals associated processing

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
continues to grow in large part because

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll the current and emerging technologies

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that permit basically the processing

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or continuous-time signals by

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
first converting to discrete-time signals

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and processing them with discrete time systems

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and that in fact is a topic that we will

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
discuss in a fair manner detail later on in the course

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
let's now turn our attention to systems

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and as they indicated a system

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
basically processes signals

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and they have of course inputs

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and outputs and depending on

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
whether we're talking about continuous-time for discrete-time

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the system maybe a continuous-time system

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or a discrete-time system so in the continuous-time

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
case I indicate here in input: accept T

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and an output y ft if we were talking

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
about discrete-time system I would represent

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
the the input in terms a discrete-time

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
variable and of course the output interns a

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
discrete-time variable also

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
now in very general terms systems are hard to deal with

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
because is they are defined very broadly a very generally

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and in dealing with systems and analyzing

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
what we will do is attempt to exploit

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
some very specific and as we'll see

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
very useful system properties

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to indicate what I mean and how things might be split up

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
we could talk about systems and we'll talk about systems

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that are linear and we could

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
divide systems basically into systems that are either linear

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
or nonlinear and we will

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
or and also devices turns into systems that are

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
what we refer to as time-invariant

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
or time-varying systems and these aren't turns that

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
we've defined yet of course but we will be defining

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in the course very shortly and while

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in some sense this division represents all systems and this those two

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the focus of the course is really going to be principally

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
on linear time-invariant systems

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so in its basically the system's

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that we will be focusing on and

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
will be referring to those systems as linear

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
time-invariant systems

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
well as a free clip said some other kinds of things that systems can do

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
let me illustrate first in

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I a one-dimensional continuous-time

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
context and then later with a discrete-time example

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
one example I'll some processing

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll signals with an appropriate system

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the particular example that I want to illustrate

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
relates to the restoration or old recordings

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and missus some work that was done by Professor Thomas stocker who

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is at the University Utah and work that he had done a number of years ago

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
relating to the fact day in all recordings

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for example in caruso recordings

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the recording was done through mechanical morning

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and the characteristics love the horn tended to vary from day to day

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and because if the characteristics of the horn

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the recording tended to have a muffled quality something like

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
yes sorta the sense that you would get

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
if you were speaking through a megaphone

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what professor stock and it was developed a system

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
to process these old recordings

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
in such a way dead a lot or

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the characteristics and distortion do

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to that recording system was removed so I'd like to

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
illustrate that as one example some signal processing with an appropriate

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
continuous-time system and what you'll hear

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is a to track recording

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
on the first track is the original on restored

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
caruso recording and on the second track

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
is the result of the restoration and so as I switch back and forth

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
from channel one to channel two will be switching from

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the original to the restored will begin the tape

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
by playing the original and

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
day and as it proceeds will switch

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
so we begin on channel one

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
low pS The Regent

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
switch now process middle

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
him home

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
his back 0 hit

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
back to the original p

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I read

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
back to the restoration

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
mine yard

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
home

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and once again back to the rigid

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
mid

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and presumably and hopefully what you heard

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
was dead in the restoration in fact a lot of the muffled

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
characteristics the original recording

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
were compensated for or remove now

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
one of the interesting things that happened in fact in the work that

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
lesser Stockham did is that in the process of the restoration and perhaps

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you've heard this

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
in the process of the restoration in fact some other background noise on the

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
recording

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
was emphasize and so he processed

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
this the signal further in an attempt to

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
remove that background noise and with that particular processing the

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
processing

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
was very highly nonlinear a very interesting thing happened

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
which was that not only in at processing

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
was the background noise removal but somewhat surprisingly

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
also the orchestra was and let me just plain bad

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
now as an example love some very sophisticated processing

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
with the nonlinear system what you'll hear on channel one

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
0 is the restoration as

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
we just plated when I switch to chat

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to will the Hampton

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
processing him home

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and acted one now

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
0 would im

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
hell

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
now inside

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
back

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
why did

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
well

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
him

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
finally once again world

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
okay so

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that's an example love processing Ave

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
continuous-time signal with a corresponding continuous-time

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
system now I'd like to illustrate an example

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
some processing discrete-time signal and I'd like to do that in the context that

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the example

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
ratio before a discrete-time signal which was

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the dow jones industrial weekly stock market index

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I head shown it before as

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've shown it here again over a period

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
of slightly more than a year where this

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
is the number of weeks and this is the

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
weekly index and to illustrate

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
some of the processing what I'd like to do

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is show the stock market index

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
weekly index over a much longer time period a particular

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
the weekly index over a ten year period

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and that's what I show here so

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what this covers is roughly 1927

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to 1937 and

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in this case although this is still a discrete-time signal

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
just simply for the purposes display what we've done

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is to essentially connect the dots and

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
draw continuous curve through the points so that this picture isn't filled up

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
with a lot of vertical lines

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
so this is the discrete-time sequence

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
represents the weekly Dow Jones

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Dow Jones index over a 10-year period and

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
here by the way again is the crash of

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it's interesting to note by the way day

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
actually the disaster in the stock market wasn't so much the 1929 crash

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but the long downward trend that follow that and you can see that here

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
by kinda filtering through by I

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the rapid variations in the index and what you see is this

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
smooth downward trend followed

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
eventually by upward trend now

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
this issue love looking at something like this looking at a sequence

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and following the smoother parts if it namely

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the long-term trends is in fact something

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that is done quite typically with economic time series like this

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and in particular what's done is to smooth it

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
or average over some time period

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to emphasize the slow variations and de-emphasize the rapid variations

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and that in fact is processing that is done

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
with discrete-time system solos when you hear referred to let's say

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
in stock market reports fifty one day moving average

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that in fact is processing the stock market index

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
with a particular discrete-time system the result

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
up doing that on this particular example

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
generates a smooth version the curve which I overly here

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and the overlay

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
than is really attempting to track the

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
smoother variations and deemphasized

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
more rapid variations let me just

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
slightly offset that so that the different stands out a little more

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and so here you see what is

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the original weekly index and

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
this is the result processing that sequence

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
with inappropriate system

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to apply smoothing and in fact

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
what it is is a moving average and so here again

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
you can see the in the smooth occurred

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
this general downward trend

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
up until this time period followed by eventually

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
recovery I well we've seen

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
example with a continuous-time signals

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
caruso recording an example with the discrete-time signal

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
this stock market index and what I'd also like to show

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is 30 example which is

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
the result some processing on an image in particular

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the image that we talked about before which was the aerial photographs

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that had the problem some cloud cover

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
so once again what we see here

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is the original aerial photograph

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
with the cloud cover and

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
some processing was applied to this using a system

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
which in fact was both nonlinear

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and quote time-varying or in the case

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
these independent variables would refer to it as spatially varying

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and the result applying that processing

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is shown in the joining

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
picture and what we see the air is

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
hopefully a reasonable attempt

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to compensate for the cloud cover and

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
this by the way was some work was done by Professor

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
them MIT and has been

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
very successful type processing were

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
aerial photographs I should say also

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that this particular example is one where although the original signal

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
was a signal dead is continuous time that is

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the independent variables are continuous as they are in a spatial

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
aerial photograph in fact for the processing

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that picture was first converted to a sequence

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
through a process called sampling which will be talking about later

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and then the processing in fact was done on a digital computer

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
okay well these then are some examples

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
all the use I'll some

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
systems to process

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
some signals both in continuous-time

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
in discrete-time for one-dimensional signals

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and for multi-dimensional signals

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and as I kinda refer to systems we've

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
thought of them as kinda one big block with appropriate

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or associated input and output and

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
as will be getting into in the first part of the course

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
very often systems are interconnected together

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
for a variety of reasons some other kinds of interconnections that will talk

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
about

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
are connecting systems

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
in what are called series are cascaded connections

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
parallel interconnections feedback

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
interconnections and feedback interconnections

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in fact are very interesting very important

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
for useful and will be major topic

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
toward the end of the course feedback

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
as you may or may not know

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
comes into play in a variety of situations

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
for example an amplifier design is we'll talk about

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the black feedback plays an important role

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in a situation where you have

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
a basically unstable system feedback is often used to stabilize the system

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and feedback interconnections systems in that sense

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
are very often used in high-performance aircraft

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
which are inherently unstable and are stabilized

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
this kind in action

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
just two give you a little sense this

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
without going into any of the details

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
what i'd like to show you is and excerpt

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
from a lecture day

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
we'll be seeing toward the end of the course relating to

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
feedback analysis a feedback systems and uses a feedback

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and this is in the context what's referred to

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
as the inverted pendulum which is

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
system that's basically unstable feedback

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
interconnections are used to stabilize the idea

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
as you'll see in this brief clip is that

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
there is a cart that's moving on a track

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
with a ride its pivoted at the base

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and so that system in the absence anything

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is unstable in that the ride attend for

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and as we going to in detail in the lecture

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
later use feedback to

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
position the card under the pendulum to balance it

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and in fact that balancing can be done even

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
when we modify the system in a variety of ways

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
as you'll see in this clip so let's take a look at that

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
remembering that this is just a brief excerpt

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
from a longer discussion I can change the

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
overall system even further by

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
let's say for example pouring a liquid

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and now let me also comment that

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
change the physics of a little bit because the

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the liquid can slash around a little bit comes a little more complicated

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
system but as you can see it still

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
remains balance

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
as you'll see when we get to it by the way that demonstration was a lot of fun

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
to do

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
now in talking about signals and systems as we go through the course

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
their are several domains to in particular

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that we will find convenient for

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the analysis and representation signals and systems

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
one is the time-domain

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
which is what we tend to think

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and which we have kind of been focusing on

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
in the discussion so far in this lecture

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
by equally important is what's referred to

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
as the frequency-domain

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
as representation for signals

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and as a means for analysis for systems

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and in the context or the frequency-domain representation

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
some old the kinds a ideas on topics that will be exploring

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
are the Fourier transform and

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the le plus transform and

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
a discrete-time counterpart the apostrophe is for which is the sea

00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
transport

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the Fourier transform discussion will get into fairly early in the course

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and the La Paz transforming z transform

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
represent extensions the 48 transform and will be getting into

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that later in the course just kinda initially

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to think about the time domain and frequency domain

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
you might think for example over No being played

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and the time-domain representation would be

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
how let's say the

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
sound pressure as a function of time would change

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and the frequency domain representation would

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
correspond to representation the frequency content

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
the No and in fact what I'd like to do is

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
illustrate that and those two domain simultaneously

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
by playing a glockenspiel

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
no which'll here is the No

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
repeated several times over and at the same time

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you'll see to displays one on the left

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
representing the time domain display a representation

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
the signal and the one on the right representing the frequency

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
me so let's look at that and

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
you'll hear the note and simultaneously see these two displays

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
there's the No on the left time

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
ways and on the right what we see

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is frequency content in particular

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
indicating the fact dead there are several harmonics

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
lines tell

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
okay well what I've gone thru

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
in this lecture represents a brief overview

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
signals and systems and beginning with the next lecture we will be

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
much more specific and precise first

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
discussing some basic signals and then

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
talking about systems and system properties and how to exploit

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
as one final comment that I'd

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
like to making this lecture I'd like to

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
emphasizes at the out said

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
dead the taped lectures

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
represent only one com- ponent the cores

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and equally important will be

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
both the textbook and the video course manual in particular

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
it's important not only to reviewing the tapes

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but simultaneously or in conjunction with that

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
doing the appropriate reading in the textbook and

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
also working through the problems carefully

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
in the video course manual in a course like this

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
you basically only get out a bit as much as you put into it

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the hope is dead if you put the

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
right amount of time and effort into it you'll find the course to be

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
educational and interesting and I certainly hope that will be the case

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
thank you
