13
00:00:60,230 --> 00:01:03,360 
in the last lecture we discussed
sinusoidal

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,830 
and real in complex exponential signals
both

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,240 
for continuous-time and discrete-time no
signals will form very

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,760 
important building blocks when we

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,740 
return to the discussion love Fourier
analysis and later lectured

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,840 
in today's lecture I'd like to introduce

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840 
some additional basic signals
specifically

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,790 
the unit step and unit impulse signal
let's begin

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,190 
with discrete-time and the discrete-time
units that

22
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,479 
in unit in polls the discrete-time unit
step

23
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,800 
is a sequence is a indicated here
specifically

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,580 
a sequence which is zero for

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,920 
negative values if its argument and
equal to 1

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,710 
for positive values up its argument and
0

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,910 
so mathematically

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,630 
the unit step sequence is one

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,000 
for in greater than or equal to 0 and 0

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,239 
for and less than zero the unit impulse
sequence

31
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,000 
likewise is defined in a straightforward
way

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,430 
the union Paul sequence is a sequence
which

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,230 
is 0 for all values if its argument

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,860 
except for an equal 0 so

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,790 
the unit step in unit impulse sequence
are defined in a straightforward way

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,000 
mathematically and in fact in they are
also related

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200 
to each other in a straightforward way
mathematically

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,480 
specifically the unit in paul's

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,660 
can be related to the unit step

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,160 
through the relationship that i've
indicated here

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,870 
Beltre van the unit impulse

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,140 
equal to units that minus the unit
stepped away

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,709 
so mathematically the relationship

44
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,760 
is what is referred to as a first

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,200 
difference

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,880 
and to see the validity love this
expression

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,570 
we can simply looking at the unit step

48
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,990 
and it's the late version so

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,640 
here we show the unit step you then

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,230 
here we show the unit step delayed

51
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,330 
by one so it 0 for and less than or
equal to 0

52
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,030 
and clearly if we subtract that the late
step

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,200 
from the original unit step everything
subtract out except at

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,700 
an equal 0 which at which point the
difference is equal to 1

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,540 
and so the difference between you have
an

56
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,260 
and you then -1 is simply the unit

57
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,000 
impulse sometimes incidently also
referred to as the unit sample

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,090 
now

59
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,340 
in a similar way we can

60
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,710 
express the unit step in terms of the
unit impulse and there are several ways

61
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,750 
of doing this

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,530 
one-way is through a relationship
referred to as a running start

63
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,720 
what I mean by that is

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,130 
the following expression: if we

65
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,160 
think love morning

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080 
some from minus infinity

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,100 
up to some bad UN

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,290 
all a unit in paul's

69
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,300 
our unit sample then this running some

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,780 
in fact is equal to the unit step

71
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,810 
and we can see that in a

72
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,670 
fairly straightforward way by simply
observing

73
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,290 
dead in this expression when and is less
than 0

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,730 
is nothing accumulated in the some

75
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,280 
and we can see that graphically as
they've shown here

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,830 
so for and less than zero we accumulate
no turns into some

77
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,870 
whereas for an greater than

78
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,560 
0 we cumulate one non-zero value in the
some

79
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,300 
namely the value of the unit sample at
an equal 0

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,680 
so we have then

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,760 
one expression for the relationship
between the unit step in the unit sample

82
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,400 
we can also develop another relationship

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,640 
by observing

84
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,540 
in essence there if we look at the unit
step sequence

85
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,190 
as I've returned to hear weekend

86
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,760 
in effect think the unit step sequence

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,160 
as a six-session love unit

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,080 
impulses one following another so

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,950 
if we consider

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,140 
forming Assam

91
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,390 
all the lady impulses as i indicate
mathematically here

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,419 
and as i indicate graphically down below

93
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,160 
we have an impulse here at an equal 0

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,450 
and an impulse here and any calls one

95
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,560 
and impose here at any cost to et cetera

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,360 
and when we continue to add these up

97
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,970 
then what they add up to is the

98
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,570 
unit step sequence and so mathematically
then

99
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,729 
that would correspond to and im polls
that an equal 0

100
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,260 
plus an impulse to 10 equals 1 was an
impulse

101
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,050 
at any calls to et cetera now in this

102
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,220 
in continuous-time we have a very

103
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,860 
more or less similar situation we

104
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,919 
will find it equally useful to talk
about a

105
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,380 
unit step continuous-time signal and

106
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,440 
the unit impulse continues time signal
let's begin

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,150 
with the continuous-time unit step be

108
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,190 
continuous-time unit step function is
graphically

109
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,310 
indicated as I've shown here it's a time
function

110
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,280 
which is 0 party less than zero

111
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,000 
and it's one for T greater than 0

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,540 
and so mathematically what it
corresponds to

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,040 
is you if he defined as

114
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,690 
a time function which is zero for T less
than zero

115
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,240 
one pretty greater than 0

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,640 
now an obvious question is what happens

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,520 
at Evil zero and the difficulty here
which is not a difficulty that arises in

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,420 
the discrete-time

119
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,490 
case is that act equal 0

120
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,910 
the unit step function is in fact
discontinuous

121
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,470 
which generates a variety mathematical
problems

122
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,830 
and one can define the units that

123
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,400 
at equal zero in a variety ways

124
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,020 
but the essential point is that the unit
step function

125
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,450 
is discontinuous so in effect

126
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,270 
what we need to do is think if the unit
step function

127
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,960 
as the limit all a continuous function

128
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,579 
and so we can define a function which I
specify here

129
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,490 
as use a delta see

130
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,030 
and used to build the T is a time
function

131
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,780 
which is 0:40 less than zero

132
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,620 
linearly increases to time Delta

133
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,250 
which would correspond to this
breakpoint and then

134
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,610 
one following that and so

135
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,870 
we can think then love the discontinuous
units step

136
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,470 
as the limiting form use a delta at:

137
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,350 
as Delta goes to zero

138
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,760 
now we also wanted to find a

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,750 
unit impulse function and it had a
fairly straightforward definition

140
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,000 
in discrete-time in continuous time
things get

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,400 
slightly more difficult and to motivate
the definition

142
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,520 
let me return to the discrete-time
definition

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,270 
all or the rather the discrete-time
relationship between

144
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,010 
the unit step and the unit impulse
function

145
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,339 
in discrete-time we saw

146
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,890 
dead the unit impulse function

147
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,200 
is the first difference all

148
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800 
the unit step function

149
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,690 
well similarly in continuous-time

150
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,060 
we can talk about and impulse function

151
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,650 
which is the first derivative love

152
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,030 
a unit step function

153
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,630 
so the unit impulse as we wanted to find
it

154
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,890 
is the derivative of the units that

155
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,530 
course we just finished discussing the
fact that

156
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,699 
the unit step function is in fact
discontinuous it equals 0

157
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,970 
but we can't think love its derivative
as related

158
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,839 
to this approximation to the units there

159
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,060 
and specifically we will think love

160
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,400 
the continuous-time in polls as

161
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,100 
the derivative %uh use a belt 50

162
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,250 
as Delta goes to zero so

163
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,240 
to define the unit in polls we think
I've the derivative

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,579 
love this approximation to the unit step

165
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,390 
and then observe what happens as Delta
goes to zero

166
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,040 
we have then the definition love

167
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,260 
the unit impulse function

168
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,449 
more or less formally to find as

169
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,030 
the first derivative of the units step

170
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,910 
or thought I love as the limiting form

171
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,120 
love the derivative love

172
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,370 
the approximation to the unit step

173
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,010 
in the limit as Delta the

174
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,510 
the duration love the discontinuity goes
to zero

175
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,590 
well let's look at that if we

176
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,860 
think about the derivative love

177
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,250 
used to build the T the derivative of
course is 0 for T less than zero

178
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,700 
its equal to a constant during this
linear slow

179
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,980 
and then it 0 pretty greater than Delta
so

180
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,450 
the derivative abusive Delta 50 will
then

181
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,740 
be as i've indicated here and

182
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,300 
is simply a rectangle with a height

183
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,000 
which is one over Delta and with which
is equal to Delta and observed that no

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280 
matter what the value of Delta is

185
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,450 
the area is always equal to 1

186
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,190 
now as we let Delta go to zero

187
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,070 
what happens is that the width of the
rectangle get smaller

188
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,590 
the height of the rectangle gets bigger
the area still remains one

189
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,030 
as Delta goes to zero of course the with
goes to zero

190
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,070 
and the height goes to infinity

191
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,070 
and graphically we choose to depict that

192
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,450 
as an arrow where

193
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,330 
the arrow indicates the fact dead we
have

194
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,980 
and im polls occurring at equal 0 and

195
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,920 
and the height of the in polls is used
to represent

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,350 
what the area above the impulses and in
this case

197
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,850 
since we took the derivative of the
units that the

198
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,320 
quite is people to want

199
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,230 
so the impulse has 0 with

200
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,000 
infinite hi area one its

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,700 
mathematically not terribly comfortable
because

202
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,680 
what we've done is taking the derivative
of the unit step which has a

203
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,550 
discontinuity at the origin

204
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,390 
and there's a mathematical difficulties
with doing that

205
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,970 
well in fact return to another
interpretation

206
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,140 
%uh the in polls later up

207
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,840 
can't emphasize sum up the sir
discomfort with the impulse

208
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,910 
I remember something that Sam Mason

209
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,640 
used to say that a student said about
the unit impulse which was

210
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,800 
his definition was unit impulse is
something that's so small everyplace I

211
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,710 
can't see it

212
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,040 
except that one point where it's so big
I can see it in other words I can see it

213
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,560 
at all

214
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,960 
well except some informality

215
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,670 
with the unit impulse function in the
continuous-time

216
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,180 
K's and generally we'll see

217
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,870 
that we won't get into particular
difficulty okay now

218
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,970 
the impose is the derivative the step we
saw

219
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,150 
in the discrete-time case that step

220
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,150 
could be recovered from the in polls
through a running some

221
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,160 
in continuous time with the impulse is
the derivative overstep we would

222
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,370 
moralist reasonably expect that this
step

223
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,850 
would be like an integral the in polls
and indeed that's true

224
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,910 
in fact mathematically the relationship
is

225
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,740 
that the unit step

226
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,200 
function in continuous-time

227
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,550 
is the running integral although

228
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,020 
the unit impulse function and

229
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,030 
so is the integral from minus infinity
up to time TV

230
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,540 
weighty is the argument at which

231
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,750 
were examining you ft and so

232
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,570 
just as with the discrete-time case if

233
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,380 
we are looking at T less than zero

234
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,510 
is no area accumulated in the integral

235
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,270 
if we're looking at T greater than 0
then we accumulate the area

236
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,750 
under the impulse

237
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,700 
okay now will shortly

238
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,730 
be returning to a

239
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,770 
further discussion in use love

240
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,060 
impulses and step functions

241
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,080 
and in particular what we'll see is that

242
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,530 
they provide a very convenient and
powerful mechanism

243
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,710 
for describing a particular class two
systems referred to

244
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,880 
as linear time-invariant systems to lead
up to that discussion which will

245
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,990 
be the principal focus of the next
lecture

246
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,330 
let's for the remainder this lecture
talk about systems in general

247
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,500 
and then some properties have systems
and

248
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,670 
as the lecture proceeds the

249
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,980 
specific properties that I want to get
to our properties

250
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,680 
when the arity and time very so let's
first talk about

251
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,150 
systems in general and a system

252
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,270 
in general in its most general
definition

253
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,600 
it simply a transformation

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,850 
from an input signal to an output say so
in a continuous-time case

255
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,120 
we would have a continuous-time system

256
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,490 
the input exit the

257
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,050 
and the output why if the and the box

258
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,760 
in essence is used to denote a
transformation from

259
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,350 
except the to white T and sometimes will
also use a shorthand notation

260
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,140 
along the lines of indicating that the
input except the

261
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,720 
is transformed to the output y'at

262
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,160 
now we have exactly the same

263
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,070 
kinda definition in the discrete-time
case in the discrete-time case

264
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,240 
of course the inputs are sequences

265
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,740 
and the outputs are sequences and our
shorthand notation

266
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,120 
is simple often we talk about systems

267
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,420 
will want to talk about interconnections
systems

268
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,570 
and will see you again in later lectures
that interconnections become very

269
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,320 
important and powerful

270
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,370 
and in in the way of introducing

271
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,410 
terminology let me introduce the
terminology for a few basic important

272
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,470 
interconnections systems the first

273
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,300 
is what's referred to as a cascade

274
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,690 
systems or sometimes as the series

275
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,790 
interconnection systems and

276
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,380 
putting two systems in cascade as i've
indicated here

277
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,820 
means taking the output have one system

278
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,080 
let's say system one and using Matt as
the input

279
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,290 
to the second system which are denoted
as system to

280
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,550 
so in this cascade with

281
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,970 
system one first and system to second

282
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,220 
we have the output system one going into
the input

283
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,340 
system to now

284
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,380 
we could've course take those two
systems

285
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,330 
and cascade them in the reverse order

286
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,160 
namely take the output system to and put
it into

287
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,160 
the input of system one and

288
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,080 
i've indicated that here and we have
system to first in the Cascade

289
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,220 
followed by system one it's important to
keep in mind

290
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,370 
dead in general for general systems

291
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,350 
in the order in which you can SCADA
systems is very important

292
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,420 
and in fact the

293
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,000 
overall system transformation will be
different depending on which system came

294
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,810 
first and which system came second for
example

295
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,430 
its system one was let's say in a system
for which the output doubles the input

296
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,580 
is double the input and system to

297
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,210 
the output is the square root of the
input clearly

298
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,770 
doubling first and then taking the
square root is different

299
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,820 
then taking the square root first and
then double

300
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,140 
now kinda amazingly

301
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,390 
what we'll see again when we get

302
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,140 
to this issue linearity and
time-invariant switcher class of systems

303
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,280 
that will focus in on

304
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,960 
somewhat amazingly it turns out that for
that

305
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,520 
specific classes systems the SIS

306
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,660 
overall system transformation is
independent of the order in which

307
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,250 
the system's are cascade and we'll see
that of course in more detail later on

308
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,000 
alright well that's a cascade or series
interconnection

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,120 
let's look at another interconnection
which is a parallel

310
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,420 
interconnection systems and

311
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,680 
here what's meant by the interconnection

312
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,880 
is that the input

313
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,160 
is fitted simultaneously into system one

314
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,260 
and into system to

315
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,540 
and then the outputs these two systems

316
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,870 
are added to give the overall system
output

317
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,760 
now in this particular case

318
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,340 
in contrast to a cascade no matter

319
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,970 
what the systems are it turns out

320
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,460 
that a parallel combination the order in
which

321
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,540 
their put in parallel

322
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,670 
is the out the overall transformation is
independent up the order

323
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,470 
and of course that follows from the fact
that we simply adding up outputs

324
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,920 
and the outputs can be added in any
order because the fact that addition

325
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,720 
doesn't care

326
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,830 
in which order you're heading things up

327
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,110 
okay so that's the parallel
interconnection and let's look at

328
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,600 
one more interconnection which is what's
referred to

329
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,960 
as a feedback interconnection and

330
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,480 
this again is a interconnection that
will

331
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,350 
become a very important topic much later
in the course

332
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,930 
but let me just indicate at this point
what I mean by it

333
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,980 
but a feedback interconnection means is
that

334
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,610 
we have one system

335
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,670 
system one

336
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,090 
with an input in an output

337
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,720 
the output a system one is the output of
the overall system

338
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,880 
and that output is fayed

339
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,130 
into system to

340
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,710 
the output of system to is then handed

341
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,860 
to the input to the overall system

342
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,770 
so in essence what happens in a feedback
interconnection

343
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,850 
we have one system the output in that
system

344
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,160 
is fed back through system to

345
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,400 
added to the overall input and then that
some

346
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,060 
is what forms the input the system one
and will see that there are

347
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,110 
lots of uses for feedback and of course
also lots of ways the feedback getting

348
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,810 
the gets in the way

349
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,360 
in fact probably some love you are
already familiar with all the issues &

350
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,550 
feedback

351
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,070 
for example in audio systems or whatever
but this will be

352
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,050 
a topic that will devote considerable
amount of time to

353
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,330 
later in the course and then

354
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,140 
of course there are lots of other
interconnections

355
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,130 
love systems and as the course
progresses we'll see

356
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,450 
lots of ways in which systems get
interconnected both in series and

357
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,700 
parallel and feedback interconnections
et cetera

358
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,040 
to achieve a wide variety of things

359
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,820 
now what I said so far relates to

360
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,930 
systems in general and you can't say
much

361
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,480 
about systems when you try to treat them
in the most general form

362
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,670 
so it's useful and important to focus in

363
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,170 
on properties that system may or may not
have

364
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,530 
so what I'd like to do now is turn our
attention

365
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,440 
to system properties and will define

366
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,230 
a number of them some of them will want
to impose on a system

367
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,480 
some love the movie we may not want to
impose on a system

368
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,640 
but as things progress will

369
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,810 
tend to find it useful to an ass

370
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,200 
weather is system does or doesn't have a
certain property

371
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,070 
well let's begin with the property which
I A

372
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,690 
refer to here and

373
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,220 
is memoryless and what I mean by

374
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,220 
system being memoryless is dead

375
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,260 
the output at any

376
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,760 
given time t0 depends

377
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,330 
only on the input at the same time and
so

378
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,120 
know what I'm suggesting is that a
memoryless system

379
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,090 
is one for which the output at a
specific time

380
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,050 
depends only on the input at that time

381
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,060 
and that statement is true or that
definition

382
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,650 
applies both for continuous-time

383
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,760 
as i've indicated it here and also

384
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,090 
for discrete-time as i've indicated here
and so

385
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,100 
we have similar definition in
discrete-time

386
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,730 
that the system is memoryless

387
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,380 
if the output at any given time

388
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,130 
depends only on the input at that time
well

389
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,000 
in I have a number of examples here
let's look at

390
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,150 
the first example which in which the
output is the square if the input

391
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:39,060 
and that is a possible system either in
continuous-time

392
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,530 
for discrete-time and that system as

393
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,520 
you would expect is commonly referred to
as

394
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,980 
square insists the square

395
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,560 
up a signal and anytime depends only on

396
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,170 
the value the signal at that time
clearly

397
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,850 
square is a memoryless system so

398
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,820 
in fact weekend indicate here and this
system

399
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,860 
is members

400
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,980 
another important system is

401
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,310 
what is referred to as an integrator its

402
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,390 
the the output is equal to

403
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,020 
the integral love the input

404
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,180 
here as i've indicated it

405
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,470 
its a not just integrating except TV but
its integrating the square affect safety

406
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,770 
and whether we square

407
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,730 
before we had a great or not the
essential point

408
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,120 
is there since we're integrating the
input

409
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,940 
the value of the output anytime

410
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,340 
is an accumulation a past history the
input well

411
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,120 
accumulation a past history in essence
implies memory

412
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,330 
to get the output at a given time

413
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,580 
requires the input

414
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,080 
over an interval specifically for longer
than that time so

415
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:16,080 
this system in fact is not memory loss

416
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,330 
and now I have a

417
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,090 
third system the fine here the third
system

418
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,390 
is a system the discrete-time system

419
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,550 
in which the output is equal to

420
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:36,880 
the input but not quite the output at
some time let's say for example that an

421
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,980 
equal 0

422
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,310 
is equal to the input at one

423
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,550 
time sample or instant or value with the
index

424
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,630 
before that and so this in fact

425
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:56,340 
is a system for which the output is
simply the input the lady or shifted

426
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,680 
by one sample so this system is referred
to as

427
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,970 
unit delay

428
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,570 
and now the question

429
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,680 
the question is is that system
memoryless

430
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,680 
well the output depends only on the
input the output at any instant depends

431
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,670 
only

432
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,580 
on the input at one instant but

433
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,630 
since it depends on an instant

434
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,160 
prior to the time in which were looking
we're different than the time at which

435
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,010 
were looking

436
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,160 
it violates the definition a memoryless

437
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,290 
that we introduce and so in fact the
unit the LEI

438
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,160 
is a system that has memory and so

439
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,850 
let's indicate that year so this is not
a memoryless

440
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,560 
system because of the fact that there is
one unit at the lay

441
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,869 
and in essence the lady requires memory

442
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,469 
okay so bats the issue memory and

443
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:06,519 
and a memoryless systems let's now turn
to another

444
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,629 
property which a system

445
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,749 
may or may not have the property
referred to as

446
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:17,269 
invertia billet now

447
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:20,379 
essentially would inverted bility means
is dead

448
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,769 
given the output above the system

449
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:26,859 
you can figure out uniquely with the
input was

450
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:30,279 
thats one definition for infertility

451
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,139 
said another way convertibility means
that

452
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,119 
given the output there's only one input
that could have caused it

453
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:41,729 
that's another common so definition for
portability

454
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:45,710 
another way of looking at it is in fact

455
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,619 
to look at it in the context love a
cascade

456
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:53,529 
love systems so

457
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,729 
let's consider a system and here

458
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:00,950 
is a system which are referred to as
system a

459
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,820 
and this could be continuous-time and
discrete-time

460
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,869 
it has an input x1

461
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,080 
TV or an depending on whether it's
continuous-time and discrete-time that

462
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,129 
we're talking about

463
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,799 
and an associated output

464
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,679 
and here we had

465
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,309 
go system be with

466
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:30,259 
its associated input an output and

467
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,119 
now let's put these two systems in
cascade

468
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,779 
so will take the output system one and
feed it

469
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,490 
into the input love system

470
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,600 
to or system be so

471
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,909 
the output system a goes into the input
a system be

472
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:54,129 
and if system is invertible

473
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:58,119 
and system be is its in burgers

474
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,379 
then the consequence

475
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:05,419 
is that the output subsystem be

476
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:09,230 
is equal to the input of system a

477
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,950 
now I know there there a lotta

478
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,039 
inputs and outputs and inverse is in the
air

479
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,179 
by essentially what we mean by what I
just said

480
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,320 
is that if we have system a

481
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,710 
and is invertible and if

482
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,570 
we cascaded with its infers

483
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,580 
system be then

484
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,080 
the overall cascade these two systems

485
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,490 
is simply what's referred to as

486
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:48,200 
the identity system

487
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,640 
and the identity system is simply a
system

488
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,710 
which if you put a signal into it you
get the same signal

489
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,970 
out a bit in other words the overall
system is

490
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,260 
no transformation at all clearly course

491
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:09,260 
for a system to be able to be cascaded
with another system

492
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,800 
to generate the identity system requires

493
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,520 
that the first system system a be
invertible

494
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,680 
so let's a

495
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,700 
look at some examples if we had

496
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,370 
system a as i've indicated here

497
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,610 
where now the output is

498
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,810 
the running integral love

499
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,850 
the input and remember that we saw the
running into role when we talked about

500
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,310 
the relationship between

501
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,860 
steps and impulses if this happened to
be in in polls

502
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,610 
then the output would be a step this
system

503
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,330 
is referred to of course as an
integrator

504
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,460 
since the output is

505
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,190 
the running integral love the input

506
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,970 
and in the

507
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,100 
integrator in fact is an invertible
system

508
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,330 
and its infers

509
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,130 
is system for which the output is the
derivative

510
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,160 
%um so the inverse

511
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,640 
or system a if system a is an integrator

512
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,410 
is system for which the output

513
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,660 
is equal to the derivative the input
which not surprisingly

514
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,860 
is referred to and

515
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,860 
is a differentiator

516
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:46,470 
so an integrator is invertible

517
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,720 
its inverse is a differentiator which
you might want to think about

518
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,820 
is the question of whether a
differentiator

519
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,460 
is invertible now to answer that what
you would ask yourself is

520
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,830 
if you always knew with the derivative
with the signal is would you necessarily

521
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,470 
know with the signal was in other words
if you have a differentiator

522
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,750 
you have the output of the
differentiator

523
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,460 
could you always figure out with the
input words if you could

524
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,210 
the system would be invertible if you
couldn't the system would not be

525
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:19,839 
invertible

526
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,530 
so you might just want to think about
that I guess

527
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,760 
I won't tell you right now but I'm sure
that

528
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,010 
dead you'll think about that more
particularly with the

529
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,750 
guidance that the video manual

530
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,799 
okay well let's look at one

531
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,000 
last system in i've indicated here

532
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,720 
a system for which the output

533
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,000 
is related to the input through this

534
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500 
heard and what I mean by this curve
which

535
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,349 
wasn't done a quite as well

536
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:01,299 
as I might have is that

537
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,140 
the output is equal to the square

538
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,619 
the input so this system

539
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:11,660 
is our square as we talked about before

540
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,089 
we saw previously

541
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:18,150 
are discussed the fact previously bad

542
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,619 
the squarer is a memoryless

543
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,520 
system

544
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,599 
and now the question is is the square

545
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,440 
an invertible system well question then

546
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,810 
is if you given the square the signal

547
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,840 
can you figure out with the signal is
and

548
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,500 
as I'm sure you've already suspected the
answer to that is no

549
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,000 
because obviously if the signal was
negative or positive you wouldn't be

550
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,320 
able to figure that out

551
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,510 
and you square so in fact

552
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:58,310 
the square is not invertible part so

553
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,740 
we've introduced several properties and
by the way

554
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,290 
as we've gone through it also in
introduce some systems that will turn

555
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,290 
out to be

556
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,849 
useful important systems and

557
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:14,750 
now it's continue with some other
properties a property

558
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,830 
dead will find useful to make reference

559
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,859 
to from time to time and will in fact
play fairly important role in a variety

560
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,260 
of discussions

561
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,320 
during the course is the property

562
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,330 
which is referred to as causality now

563
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,349 
in essence what causality beans

564
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,230 
is the following the system is said to
be causal

565
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,520 
if as one way of saying it only responds

566
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,780 
when you kick it is another way of
saying it

567
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,750 
its response that any time only depends
on values at the input

568
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,940 
prior to that time so

569
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,880 
a causal system both continuous-time and
discrete-time

570
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,570 
is to find sometimes

571
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,320 
as a system which has the property that

572
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,460 
the output and anytime depends only on

573
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,510 
the input prior or equal to that time

574
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,150 
essentially what we're saying

575
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,390 
is that the system can't anticipate

576
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,560 
future imports and so that in fact

577
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,800 
is another possible definition for
causality

578
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,450 
that the system is causal

579
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,290 
if it can't anticipate future inputs
finally at

580
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,460 
not an alternative way of saying it
mathematically

581
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,670 
is as follows: if I have

582
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,820 
to signals X 1ft

583
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:54,190 
nx2 T with their associated outputs why
150 and white 2

584
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,859 
T then a system

585
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:03,400 
is said to be causal if it only if it
has the property

586
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,520 
that if those two inputs are identical
up until sometime

587
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,630 
then the outputs are identical up until
the same time

588
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,960 
so if we have two signals that

589
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,420 
are exactly the same up until sometime
and perhaps do something different later

590
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,190 
on

591
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,830 
causality requires that

592
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,619 
the outputs not anticipate the fact that
those inputs

593
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,070 
are at some future time going to do
something different

594
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,609 
and that in fact is the most useful
mathematical

595
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:39,089 
definition of causality and of course
I've

596
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:43,140 
written that here for continuous-time

597
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,400 
and a the

598
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,990 
same definition of causality also

599
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:55,670 
applies for discrete-time

600
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,289 
okay well it's look at an example

601
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:02,599 
let's take an example

602
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,849 
which is a system which is

603
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:12,400 
the following discrete-time system the
output at any given time

604
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,529 
is some love

605
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:18,569 
exit Van X event the way

606
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:23,589 
and active and anticipated and

607
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:27,609 
this is in fact a system is very useful

608
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:34,369 
and referred to as moving average

609
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,749 
and so if we think 0 moving average

610
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:41,180 
if we have here

611
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,869 
a sequence X the van annex the van

612
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:48,930 
with other values kinda going off

613
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,339 
in both directions and any value

614
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,420 
for any value n0 at which were computing
the output

615
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,930 
and this is why I have in the output we
take

616
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,269 
X 70 X 70 -1

617
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:10,880 
and X 70 plus one and so

618
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,910 
to format moving average we would take

619
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,499 
these three bad news and combine them
together

620
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,910 
and a moment and dividing by 3 to get
back

621
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,589 
well is the system causal

622
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,939 
one way to answer that is

623
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:33,859 
to determine whether the output at any
given time depends on future values if

624
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:34,599 
the input

625
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,509 
and clearly if you look at this what you
see is that the output at time n0

626
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:44,799 
depends both on past values and on
future bad

627
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:49,329 
as opposed to another moving average

628
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:55,229 
which i've indicated here where I'd
simply shifted the values

629
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:58,660 
that I combine together and in this case

630
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,549 
because love the way in which I picked
the values

631
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:05,630 
the output depends on

632
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,839 
value in n0 value

633
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:12,339 
at and 0 -1 and the bad you

634
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:17,199 
at n0 -2 so why I've n0 would depend
here

635
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,609 
on X 70 X 70 -1

636
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:24,229 
and X 70 -2 and

637
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:28,789 
so in this case the system

638
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:32,219 
is not causal and

639
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:39,219 
in this case the system is cause

640
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,820 
all right now let's turn to another
system property the property

641
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:49,540 
referred to as stability now there lotsa

642
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,700 
definitions of stability a and

643
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,930 
there some of them get very mathematical

644
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,490 
and formal would we've chosen

645
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,150 
and what will use as our definition
stability is what's called

646
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:09,280 
bounded input founded output stability
essentially the definition is

647
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640 
that a system is stable

648
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,530 
if in only a for every bounded input

649
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,970 
the output is found so the notion is

650
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,230 
if you have a system any input never
gets above

651
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,000 
some finite value and stability requires

652
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,970 
that the output also stay within some
bounded back

653
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,540 
and I'm sure the stability and
instability your things that you're

654
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,090 
kinda

655
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,800 
arm informally familiar with let me

656
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,120 
just kinda are emphasize the point with

657
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,120 
the something that I borrowed the

658
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,210 
actually from my son

659
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,080 
with some reluctance on his part a if we

660
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,550 
for example take a system like this
which is in essence a pendulum

661
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,240 
this system is a holding it here is
stable

662
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,030 
because if I put in a bounded input
which is the displacement

663
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,040 
the output which is the movement of it

664
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,110 
remains found now on the other hand

665
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,300 
if I put the system like this which is

666
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,630 
in fact what's referred to as an
inverted pendulum although we could

667
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,090 
conceivably get this to balance

668
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,480 
just a slight displacement because the
fact that the pendulum is inverted

669
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,610 
a slight displacement and the output

670
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,690 
becomes unbounded now

671
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,960 
an interesting thing with the inverted
pendulum by the way which

672
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,190 
I'm sure all of you if you're anything
like me

673
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,140 
was intrigued with as a kid was the
notion that you could take an inverted

674
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,950 
pendulum

675
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:53,010 
and in effect turn it back into a stable
system

676
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,180 
by using what I'm doing right now

677
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,310 
which is feedback but I've done in that
case

678
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,320 
is I stabilize the system by

679
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,390 
using feedback visual feedback from my
eye

680
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,540 
to my hand and in fact one of the very
important things that we'll see about

681
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,390 
feedback when we talk about feedback
systems much later in the course

682
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,900 
is that one of their very important
applications is

683
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,230 
in stabilizing unstable systems by the
way one of their problems

684
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,180 
is dead if not used correctly it can
destabilize

685
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,440 
stable system okay well let's

686
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,840 
continue on with our a property of
stability

687
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,190 
I have here again the example

688
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,320 
of an integrator and as

689
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,170 
I indicate here if we have an integrator
and we put a step

690
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,380 
function into it or step signal into it

691
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,680 
the output is what's referred to as a
ramp

692
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,550 
signal it linearly increases now
question is

693
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,740 
is a ramp on bounded the input is

694
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,220 
is bounded step input is bounded the
ramp is unbounded

695
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,560 
because if you try to establish

696
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,990 
any bound on it you can always go out
far enough in time

697
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,140 
so that the output will exceed that ban
so

698
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,560 
in fact the integrator is

699
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,560 
not stable

700
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,300 
okay now finally I'd like to turn

701
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,440 
to two properties that will make
considerable

702
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,090 
you so there's the course goes on the
properties

703
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,170 
love time invariance and when the arid

704
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,680 
time invariance

705
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,350 
in essence says

706
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,810 
bat the system doesn't really care

707
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,390 
what you call the origin in other words

708
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,560 
it says if you take the input and your
shift in time

709
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,300 
all that you've done is taken the output
and shifted in time by the same amount

710
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,530 
someone more formally as i've indicated
here

711
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,590 
if in continuous time we have an input X
50

712
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,119 
which generates an output y'at then

713
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,850 
time invariance requires that

714
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:28,270 
if the input is shifted by any amount of
time the output is shifted by the same

715
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,300 
amount of time and exactly

716
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,720 
the same applies in discrete-time for
example

717
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,470 
if we have a system which is the system
I've shown here

718
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,810 
which by the way is the system that we
talked about previously to go

719
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,690 
from step sequence upstart from an
imposed sequence to step sequence

720
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,500 
we call that a running some and actually

721
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,810 
white it's also often called is an
accumulator

722
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,930 
what it does is accumulate past values

723
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,369 
the input well is the

724
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:12,330 
accumulator time-invariant the best way
to establish that

725
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,530 
is to work through the equations and
verified that it either

726
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,210 
does or doesn't satisfy the formal
definition

727
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,600 
time invariance informally if you think
about it

728
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,630 
it makes intuitive sense that the
accumulator

729
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,690 
is time-invariant because if you're
accumulating values

730
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:37,580 
and a few the LEI the values that you're
putting into the accumulator

731
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:43,710 
then the associated values that come out
will be delayed by the same amount

732
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,440 
the accumulated it doesn't care really
where if you shift the input is just

733
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,190 
simply shift the Associated output but

734
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,740 
more generally with your trying to test
time-invariant it's important to return

735
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,840 
to the definition

736
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,859 
and that's what you're required to do in
the samples

737
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:07,210 
in the videomail okay well

738
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,700 
I indicate another example

739
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,070 
we had the example become an accumulator
here's another example which

740
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:19,740 
in fact as we'll see later is

741
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,390 
a system which is a modulator

742
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,700 
the output is the input modulated and

743
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,290 
although you might think it first that
this system

744
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,550 
is time-invariant in fact

745
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,990 
it is not because the input shifted

746
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,180 
generates an output which is

747
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,220 
the input shifted times

748
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,340 
the same modulation function whereas

749
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,250 
if we were to take the output above the
system

750
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,480 
we're X 50 is the input than

751
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,380 
what that would correspond to

752
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,640 
is sign T-minus t0

753
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,890 
times X love t-minus 20

754
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,350 
and since these two are not equal

755
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,380 
this system is not time and very

756
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,640 
and this is an example that often

757
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,770 
causes a slight amount of difficulty
because

758
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,600 
it seems like when you look at it it
ought to be

759
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,940 
and so I strongly encourage you in the
context that using

760
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,050 
working problems in the manual

761
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,970 
that you think very carefully about this
and on

762
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,060 
and at least believe that when I told
you was the right answer

763
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,460 
okay now the final

764
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,760 
property that I want introduced today is
the property

765
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,859 
love linearity and

766
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:57,200 
linearity is defined in manner

767
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,900 
similar for continuous-time in
discrete-time

768
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,280 
and what it says is that

769
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,850 
if we have some inputs with associated
outputs

770
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,220 
let's say X 150 X 2ft

771
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,260 
then a system is linear

772
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,859 
if it has the proper the that the output

773
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:23,770 
to a linear combination of those inputs
is the same

774
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,380 
linear combination love The Associated
outputs

775
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,350 
and so that's what I've indicated here
dead

776
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,440 
if we now put into the system a linear
combination of those inputs

777
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,710 
then for linearity we require that the
output

778
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,990 
is the same linear combination and
exactly the same

779
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:47,310 
apply is in discrete-time

780
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,800 
and you can show from this definition
dead if a system is linear

781
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,030 
with two inputs and its linear in terms
of an arbitrary number

782
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,870 
imports I have

783
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,060 
a number of examples and

784
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,090 
these are examples there'd again I ask
you

785
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,380 
to think about as you look at the video
manual

786
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:16,400 
just to suggest the answer as well at
the suggest but to tell you the answer

787
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,400 
the integrator as we have here is linear

788
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:29,350 
this system in which the output is
double the input plus a constant

789
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,180 
you would kinda think is linear because
it's a straight line

790
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,960 
but one has to be careful and in fact as
it turns out

791
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,880 
this is not linear are there is a
qualifier attached to it

792
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,140 
because it has a property referred to is
incrementally linear

793
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,750 
which is discussed somewhat more in
attacks

794
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,260 
and finally we have a system which is
the square

795
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,140 
that I've indicated again here

796
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,170 
and squaring is definitely not

797
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:07,230 
a linear operation

798
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:11,049 
okay so what we've done then is to

799
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:14,210 
introduce a number properties systems

800
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,269 
a and we've also by the way is a stress
previously

801
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:24,160 
as we've gone along introduced also a
number of important and useful systems

802
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,099 
like the accumulator the integrator the
differentiator

803
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:30,329 
et cetera well we'll see

804
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:34,529 
is that the properties of when you're
ready in time invariance

805
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:38,160 
in particular become central

806
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,549 
important properties and in the next
lecture

807
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:46,029 
what will show is there with

808
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:49,450 
systems that are linear and
time-invariant

809
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:53,480 
the use love the impulse function

810
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,259 
both in continuous-time and
discrete-time provides an

811
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:58,710 
extraordinarily

812
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,319 
important and useful mechanism

813
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,700 
for characterizing systems thank you
