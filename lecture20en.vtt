the over the last series of lectures

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in discussing filtering modulation sampling we've seen how powerful

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and useful the four EA transform is beginning

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with this lecture and over the next several lectures I'd

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
like to develop and exploit a generalization

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
other 48 transform which will not only lead to some important new insights

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
about signals and systems

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but also will remove some of the restrictions

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that we've had with the Fourier transform the generalization

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
dead we'll be talking about in the continuous-time cases referred to

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
as the apostrophe its form and in the discrete-time cases referred to as the z

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
transform

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
but I'd like to do in today's lecture is begin on the continuous-time

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
case namely a discussion at the La Paz transform

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
continued at it to the next lecture and following that

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
develop the z transform for discrete-time

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and also as we go along exploit

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the two notions together now

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to introduce the notion of the law applies transform

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
let me remind you again all what led us into the Fourier transform we

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
develop the 48 transform by

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
considering the idea love representing

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
signals as linear combinations a basic signals

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and in the Fourier transform in the

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
continuous-time case the basic signals

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that we picked in the representation were complex exponentials

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and in what we refer to as

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to in effect a dick opposition as a linear combination

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
decomposition affects ft as a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and of course associated with this was

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the corresponding analysis equation dead

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
now why did we pick complex exponentials

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
well recall that the reason was

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that complex exponentials are I can functions of linear time-invariant

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
systems

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and that was very convenient specifically

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
if we have a linear time-invariant system

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
with an impulse response 850 well we had shown

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is that that class a systems has the property

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that if we put in a complex exponential we get out

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
a complex exponential at the same frequency

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and with the change in amplitude and this change in amplitude

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to 248 transform all

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the system impulse response so

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the notion love decomposing signals

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
into complex exponentials was very intimately connected in the Fourier

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
transforms very intimately connected

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
with the eigenfunction property a complex exponentials for linear

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
time-invariant systems

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
well complex exponentials have that type are not

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the only I can functions for linear time-invariant systems

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
in fact what you've seen previously

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
is that if we took a more general exponential

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you to the st. where s

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is a more general complex number not just J Omega

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but in fact Sigma plus J Omega for any bad you have s

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
a comp the complex exponential is an eigenfunction

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and we can justify that simply by substitution into the convolution

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
integral

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
in other words the response to this complex exponential

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
is the convolution up the impulse response

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
with the exhortation an notice

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
there we can break this term into a product

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
eat to the st. you need to the minus s

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
now and BU the st. term

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
become outside the integration

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and consequently just carrying through that algebra

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
would reduce this integral

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
to an integral with

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
in the st. fact there outside so just simply carrying through the algebra

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what we would conclude is that a complex exponential

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
with any complex number ass which generate as an output

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a complex exponential have the same form

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
multiplied by whatever this integral is

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and this integral of course will depend on what the value a veces

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but that's all that it will depend on or said another way

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
what this all can be denoted as

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is some function Hibs that

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
depends on the value of s so finally

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then you the st. as an exhortation

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to linear time-invariant system generates a response

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
which is a complex constant depending on S

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
multiplying the same

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
function that excited the system

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
so what we have been is

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the I can function property more generally in terms of

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
a more general complex exponential

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
where the complex factor is given by this integral

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
well in fact with that integral corresponds to

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is what we will the fine

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
as the apostrophe its form of the impulse response

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and in fact we can apply this transformation

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to a more general time function that may or may not be

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the impulse response this ove a linear time-invariant system

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and so in general it is this transformation

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
on a time function which is

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the a-plus transform that time function

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and it's a functional bests so

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the definition up the applause transform

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is that the applause transform overtime function X 50

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is the result love this transformation

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
on exit to the it's the noted as excessive ass

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and as a shorthand notation as we had with the four EA transform

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
then we have in the time domain the time function except the

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and in the apostrophe its form domain the

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
function XFS and these then

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
represent a transformed pair

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
now let me remind you that

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that the the development of that mapping

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is exactly the process that we went through initially in developing

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a mapping that ended up giving the giving us the Fourier transform

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
essentially what we've done is just broaden your horizon

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
some white or our notation some white

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and rather than pushing just the complex exponential through the system

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we've pushed a more general time function either the st.

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
where ass is a complex number with both a real part in an imaginary part

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
well the discussion we going through so far course is

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
very closely related to when what we went through

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
for the Fourier transform the mapping and we've ended up with

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
is called the applause transform and as you can well imagine and perhaps

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
may have recognized already there's a very close connection

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
between the applause transform and the Fourier transform

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
well to see wanted the connections well we can observe

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is that if we look at the Fourier transform expression

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and if we look at the applause transform expression

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
where ass is now a general complex number Sigma plus jail maker

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
these two expressions in fact are identical

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
if in fact Sigma is equal to 0

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if signatures equal to 0 so that ass is just jail maker

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
then all that this transformation is

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is the same as that substitute in s equals jail maker

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and this is what we get so

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
what this then tells us is dead if we have the apostrophe it's for

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and if we look at the applause transform at

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
ass equals J Omega

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
then that in fact corresponds to

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the Fourier transform affect safety

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
now there's a slight notational issue

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that this raises and it's very straightforward to clean it up

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but it's something that its you have to just kinda

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
focus on for second to understand what the issue is

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
notice that on the left hand side of this equation

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
X a vast representing the applause transform

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
when we look at that would signal to 0 RS equal to jail maker

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
are natural inclination is to write that

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
as exit J Omega of course

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
on the other hand the right hand side of the equation namely the Fourier

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
transform exit T

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we've typically written as

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
X all Omega focusing on the fact that

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it's a function love this variable Omega

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
well there's a slight awkwardness here because here we're talking about

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
an argument J Omega here we're talking about an argument Omega

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and a very straightforward way of dealing with that is

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to simply change our notation

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for the Fourier transform recognizing that the Fourier transform

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
course is a function of Omega but it's also

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in fact the function J Omega and if we write it that way

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
then the two notations come together in other words the applause transform

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
at st. cause jail maker just simply were reduces both mathematically and

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
rotationally

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to the Fourier transform so the notation that will now be adopting

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for the four th transform is the notation

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
whereby we express the 48 transform no longer simply as active Omega

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
but choosing as the argument jail make

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
simple notational change

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
now here we see one relationship between the Fourier transform and

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the the plots transform namely that

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the poss transform pressequals chair maker reduces to the Fourier transform

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we also have number another important relationship

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
in particular the fact that the

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
applause transform can be interpreted

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as the Fourier transform all a modified

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
version affect safety let let me show you what I mean

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
here of course we have the relationship that we just developed

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
namely s equals jail maker plus transform reduces the Fourier transform

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but now let's look at the more general applause transform expression

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and if we substitute in s equals Sigma plus J Omega

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
which is the general form for this complex variable ass

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and we carry through so the algebra

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
breaking this into the product up to exponential

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the product the two exponential see the minus Sigma T

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
time see the minus jail make it to the we now have

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
this expression where of course in both these

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
their is a DT

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and now when we look at this

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
what we observe is that this in fact

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is the 48 transform of something

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
what's the something it's not accept T anymore it's the Fourier transform up

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
x50

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
multiplied by e2 the minus Sigma T

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
so if we think I've these two terms together

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
this in a brawl is just the four EA transform

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it's the for a transformer Beck city multiplied

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
by an exponential Sigma is greater than

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
its a an exponential that

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the case with time Sigma is less than 0 it's an exponential the crows

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
time so we have

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
then this additional relationship which tells us that the apostrophe s for

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is the 48 transform love

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and exponentially weighted time function

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
now this exponential weighting has

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
some important significance in particular

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
recall that there were issues have convergence with the 48 transform in

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
particular the Fourier transform

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
may or may not converge and for convergence in fact

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
what's required is that but I'm fortunate we're transforming be

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
absolutely integral now

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
we can have a time function that isn't absolutely integral

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
because let's say it grows exponentially as time

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
increases but when we multiply it by this

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
exponential factor that's embodied in a posh transform

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in fact that brings the function back down for positive time

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and will impose absolute integrability

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
on the product %uh XFT times

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
e2 the minus Sigma T and so

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the conclusion an important point is that

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the applause transformed the Fourier transform this product may converge

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
even though the Fourier transform effective t doesn't in other words

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the apostrophe s form may converge even when the Fourier transform

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
doesn't converge and will see that will see examples of it is the discussion

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
goes along now let me also

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
draw your attention to the fact although we won't be

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
working through this in detail

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to the fact that this equation

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in effect provides the basis

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
for us to figure out how to express accept T

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
interns love the applause transform

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
effect we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to this

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
thereby to this account for the exponential factor by bring it over to

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the other side

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and if you go through this and in fact

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you'll have an opportunity to go through this both in the video course manual

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and also it's carried through in the text

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
what you end up with is

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
a synthesis equation X expression for exit T

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in terms of Xmas which corresponds to a synthesis equation

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and which now builds x50 I have a linear combination if not

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
necessarily functions the foreign to the Chi Omega TV

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
but interns love functions

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
or basic signals which are more general exponentials

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you to the st.

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
okay well let's just look at

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
some examples love the apostrophe s form of some time functions

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and these examples that I'll go through

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
are all examples that are worked out in attacks and so I don't want to focus on

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the algebra what I'd like to focus on

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
are some with the issues and the interpretation

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
let's first the ball look at example

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
the example in the text which is example 9.1

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
if we take the Fourier transform

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
love this exponential then as you well know

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the result that we have is one over J Omega plus a

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and bekannt converge for any a

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
in particular it's only for a greater than 0

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
what that really means is that for convergence of the 48 transform this has

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to be

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
a decaying exponential it can't be

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
in increasing exponentially if

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
instead we apply the applause transformed to this

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
applying to the the deal applies transform is the same as taking the 48

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
transform or

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
X 50 times an exponential in and

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the exponential that we would multiply by is he to the minus Sigma T

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
so in effect taking the applause transform of this

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
is like taking the Fourier transform augie to the minus eighty

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
e2 the minus Sigma T

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and if we carry that through just

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
working through the integral we end up

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
with applause transform which is one over est plus a

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but just as in the Fourier transform

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the Fourier transform all converge for any a

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
now what happens is that the

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
love pasta Rance form will only converge

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
when the forty a transformer this converges

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
said another way it's when the combination is a plus Sigma

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is greater than 0 so we would require

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that by right over here a plus Sigma

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is greater than 0 warmer that Sigma

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is greater than minus a so in fact

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
in the apostrophe s former this

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
we have an expression one over est plus a but

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we also require in interpreting that

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
dead the real party bass be greater

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
then minus a so that

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
essentially the 48 transform up X 50

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
times you to the minus Sigma T converges

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so it's important to recognize that the

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
algebraic expression that we get is

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
only valid for certain values love the real party vez

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and so for this example we can summarize it as

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
this exponential as the apostrophe s form which is one over est plus a

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
where ass is restricted to the range the real party best greater than

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
minus a now

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
we haven't had this issue before love restrictions on what the value a veces

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
with the with 48 transform either recover Jordan converge

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
with a plot strands form there are certain values the best we now have more

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
flexibility and so they're certain values are the real party best for which

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it converges in certain values for which it doesn't

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the values Ave S for which the apostrophe s form

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
converges is the values

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
are referred to as the region of convergence

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
up the applause transform

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and it's important to recognize that

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
in specifying the applause transform what's required is not only the

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
algebraic expression

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
but also the domain or set of values evas

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
for which that algebraic expression is

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
ballot just two

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
underscore that point let me draw your attention to another

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
example in the text which is example 9.2

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
example 9.2 we have an exponential

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
for negative time 0 for positive time

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and if you carry through the algebra there you end up with

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
a low price transform expression which is again one over S plus a

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
exactly the same algebraic expression as we head for the previous example

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the important distinction is that now

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the real party bass is restricted to be less than minus a

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
it so in fact if you compare this example

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
with the one above it and let's just look back at

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the answer that we had the air

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
if you compare that those two examples here

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the algebraic expression is 100 breast but say with a certain

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
regional convergence here

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the algebraic expression is one over est plus a

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and the only difference between those two is the domain a region of

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,000
convergence

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so there's another complication or twist now

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
not only do we need to generate the algebraic expression

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
but we also have to be careful to specify

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the region of convergence

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
over which that algebraic expression is valid

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
now later on in this lecture and actually also

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
arm as the discussion a little past transform goes on

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
will begin to see and understand more about

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
how the region of convergence relates to

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
various properties of the time function

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
okay well let's finally look at one additional example from the tax

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and this is example 9.3 and what it consists of

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is the a type function which is the sum

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
love two exponentials and

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
although we haven't formally talked about properties a little fuss transform

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
yet

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
what are the properties that will see it is relatively easy to develop

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
is the fact that the apostrophe s form of Assam

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
is the summer the applause transform so in fact we can get

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the applause transform love the solo these two terms

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
as some love the apostrophe its forms

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and so for this one we know from the

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
example that we at looked at previously example 9.1

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
that this is a form one over est plus one

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
with a region of convergence which is the real party best greater than -1

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
for this one we have a poss transform which is one over est plus two

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
with a region of convergence which is the real party bass

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
greater than -2 so

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
for the two of them together we have to take the overlap with those two regions

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in other words we have to take the region that encompasses both the real

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
party best greater than -1

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in the real party best greater than -2 and if we put those together then

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
we have a combined regional convergence which is the real party best

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
greater than -1 so this is the expression

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and for this particular example what we have

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is a ratio of polynomials

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the ratio polynomials is a numerator polynomial and at the nominator

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
polynomial

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and it's convenient to

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
summarize these by

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
plotting the roots love the numerator polynomial

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and the roots to the denominator polynomial in the complex plane

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and the complex plane which they are plotted is referred to

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
as vs playing

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so we can for example take the denominator polynomial

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and summarize it in by specifying the fact

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
or by representing the fact

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that it has roots at st. cause -1 and at a Sikh was minus-2

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and I've done that in this picture by putting an X

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
where the roots have the denominator polynomial order

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
the numerator polynomial has a rude ass equals

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
-3 hands and i've represented that by a circle

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so these are the roots to the denominator polynomial

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and this is the route up the numerator polynomial for this example

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and also for this example we can represent

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the region of convergence which

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
is the real party best greater than -1 and so that's in fact

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the region over here

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
there is also if I draw these just the router the numerator and denominator

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
plan of polynomials

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I would need an additional piece of information

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
to specify the algebraic expression completely namely

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
multiply constant out in front of the whole thing

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
well this particular example has

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
the applause transform as a

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
rational function namely its one polynomial in the numerator and another

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
polynomial in the denominator

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and in fact as we'll see applies transformers which are ratios are

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
polynomials

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
form a very important class they were in fact represent systems

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
better describe a ball by linear constant coefficient differential

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
equations

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you shouldn't necessarily in fact for sure you shouldn't see why

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
that's true now will see that later but

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that means that a-plus transforms

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that are rational functions namely

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
the ratio love the numerator polynomial divided by the nominator polynomial

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
become very important in the discussion that follows

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and in fact in we have some terminology for this the route so the numerator

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
polynomial

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
are referred to as zeros

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
up the applause transform because of course those are the values a bass

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
at which XFS become 0

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and the roots to the denominator polynomial are

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
referred to as the polls up the applause transform

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and those are the values vs

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
at which the applause transform blows up

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
namely becomes infinite if you think love setting s

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
equal to evaluate this denominator polynomial goes to zero

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
of course extra bass becomes infinite and

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
what we would expect in a course will see that

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
that this is true well we would expect

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
is that wherever that happens there must be some problem

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
with convergence oval poss transform and indeed the applause transformed doesn't

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
converge

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
at the polls namely at the roots the denominator polynomial

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so in fact let's focus in on that a little further

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
let's examine and talk about the region of convergence

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
all the applause transform and

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
how its associated both with properties of the time function

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and also with the location love the polls

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
all the applause transform and as we'll see

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the air are some very specific and important

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
relationships and conclusions that we can draw

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
about how the region of convergence

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
is constrained an Associated with the

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
locations the polls in the ass point

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
well to begin with we can

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
of course make the statement as I just made

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
that the region of convergence contains no polls

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in particular if I think

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
love this general rational function

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the polls love XFS by the values evas

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
at which the denominator 0 or equivalent Lee

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
XFS blows up and of course

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
then that implies that the expression is no longer converged

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
okay well that's one statement that we can make now there

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
are some others and one for example

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
is the statement that if I have a point

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
in the S plane that corresponds the convergence

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
then in fact any line in the S plane

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
with that same real part will also

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
be said %uh values for which the apostrophes form converges

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and what's the reason for that the reason for that

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
is dead s is Sigma plus J Omega

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and convergence all the applause transform is associated with

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
convergence love the four EA transform all

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
it to the minus Sigma see times X 50

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and so the convergence only depends on Sigma

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
if it only depends on Sigma than

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
for one if it converges for one value Sigma

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm sorry for what for a value Sigma

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
for some valuable maker Danny will converge

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
for that same Sigma for any valuable make

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the conclusion n is dead the region of convergence

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
if I have a law if I have a point that I also have a line

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and so what that suggests is that as we look at the regional convergence

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
in fact corresponds to strips in the complex plane

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
now finally we can tie together

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the region of convergence to the

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
convergence of the Fourier transform in particular since we know that

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the applause transform reduces

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to the 48 transform when

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the complex variable yes is Sigma is equal to jail maker

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
the implication is that if we have the law applies transform

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and if the a-plus transform reduces to the 48 transform

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
when sick make 10 in other words when s is equal to jail make a

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
then the 4e a transformative exit see

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
converging is equivalent to the statement

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that the a-plus transform converges

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
for Sigma equal to 0 in other words that the region of convergence

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
includes what DJ Omega axis

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
in the ass point

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
alright so we have then some statements that kinda tied together the location of

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the polls

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and the region convergence let me make one other statement which is

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
much harder statement to justify and I won't try to I just simply stated

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and that is that the regional convergence oval plus transform

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is a connected region in other words

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
if the entire region

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
consists of a single strap in the S plane

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it can consist of a strip over here for example in a strip over there

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
well let me let me I'm emphasize summer those points a little further

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
let's suppose that I A have

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
ale a-plus transform

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and Google+ transform their

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I am talking about is a rational function which is

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
one over S plus one times as plus two

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
then the poll 0 pattern as its referred to

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
in the S play in the location love the roots love the

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
numerator and denominator polynomial course there is no numerator polynomial

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
the denominator polynomial roots which have represented by these X's

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
are shown here and so this is

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the poll 0 pattern

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and from what I said the region of convergence

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
can't include any polls

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and it must correspond to strips

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
in the ass plane and furthermore it must be

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
just want some one connected region rather than multiple regions

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and so with this algebraic expression

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
then the possible choices for the region of convergence

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
consistent with those properties are the following:

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
one of them would be region of convergence

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
to the right love this poll

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a second would be a region of convergence

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
which lies between the two poles

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
as a show here and

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
a third is region of convergence

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
which is to the left love this poll

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and because it the fact dead I said without proof that

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the region of convergence must be a single strip it can't be multiple strips

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
in fact we could not consider as a possible region convergence

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
what I show here in so in fact

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
this is not a valid region of convergence

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
there are only three possibilities Associated

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
with this poll 0 pattern namely to the writer this poll

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
between the two poles and to the left that this poll

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
now to carry the discussion further

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
we can in fact associate

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
the region of convergence above the law applies transform

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
with some very specific characteristics

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
of the time function and what this will do is to help us understand

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
how various for various choices

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
love the region of convergence the interpretation

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that we can impose on the related time function

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
let me show you what I mean

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
suppose that we start with

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
a time function as i indicated here

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
which is a finite

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
duration time function in other words it's zero

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
except in some time interval now

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
recall that the Fourier transform converges

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
if the time for action has the property

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that is absolutely integral and as long as everything stays finite and

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
interns have ample to in a finite duration signal

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
there's no difficulty that we're gonna run into here

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
now here the Fourier transform will converge and now

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
the question is what can we say about the reach of convergence

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
of the apostrophe it's for well

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the applies transform is the Fourier transform

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
all the time function multiplied by an exponential

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and so we can ask a pan out whether we can destroy the absolute integrability

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
of this

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
by multiplying by an exponential that the case

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that grows too fast in the case too fast to whatever let's take a look at that

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
suppose that this time function

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
is absolutely integral and

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
let's multiply it by

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
a decaying exponential so this is now except eat I'm see the minus Sigma T

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
if I think multiplying these two together

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and what you can see is that for negative for positive time

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
sort of thinking informally I'm helping

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
the integrability of the product because I'm pushing this part down

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
for negative time unfortunately I'm making things bro

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
but I don't let them grow indefinitely because there's some time before which

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
this is equal to 0 likewise

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
if I head a growing exponential

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
then for a growing exponential

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
for negative time or for this part perhaps

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
this part making things smaller for positive time eventually this expansion

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,000
was growing without

00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
found but the time function stocks at some point

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
so the idea then kinda is dead

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
for a finite duration

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
time function no matter what kinda exponential I multiply by whether it's

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
going this way are going this way because of the fact that

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
essentially the limits on the integral are fine I'd I'm

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
guaranteed that'll always maintain absolute integrability

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and so in fact then for a finite duration time function

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the region of convergence is the entire s play

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
okay now in we can also

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
make statements about other kinds of time functions

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and let's look

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
at a time function

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
which I a defined as a right-sided

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
time function and

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
a right-sided time function is one which

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
is 0 up until sometime and then

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
it goes on after that presumably off to infinity

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
now let me remind you that

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the whole issue here with the region of convergence

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
has to do with exponentials

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
that we can multiply a time function by

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and have the product end up being absolutely integral

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
well supposed dead when I multiply this time function

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
by an exponential which lets ATK's

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
but an exponentially to the minus Sigma 0t

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
what you can see me sort of intuitively is dead if

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
this product is absolutely integral

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
if I would increase Sigma 0 then I'm making things even better for positive

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
time because I'm pushing them down

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and whereas they might be worse for negative time

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that doesn't matter because before some time

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the product is equal to 0 so if this product is absolutely an agreeable

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
then if are chosen exponential

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
it's a minus signal one teeny where signal one

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is greater than 60 then that product

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
will also be absolutely integral ball and we can draw

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
important conclusion about that about the region of convergence from that

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
in particular we can make this statement

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
dead if the time function is right sided

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and if convergence

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
occurs for some value segment 0

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
then in fact we will have convergence of the law applies transform

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
for all values all the real party bass

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
greater than Sigma 0 the reason

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
of course being dead if Sigma 0 increases

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
then the exponential DK's even faster for positive time

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
now what that says then thinking another way enters the region of convergence

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
as we might droid in the ass plane is that

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
if we have a point that's in the region of convergence corresponding to some

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
value Sigma 0

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
band all values evas to the right of that

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
in the S plane will also be in the region convergence

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
we can also combine that with the statement that for rational functions

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
we know dead there can't be any polls

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
in the region of convergence if you put those two statements together

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
then we end up with a statement dead if

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
x50 is right sided and if it's a plus transformers rational

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
then the region of convergence is to the right

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
up the rightmost poll so

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we have here a very important insight which tells us

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
dead weekend im in for some property

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
about the time function from the region of convergence

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
or conversely if we know something about the time function namely being right

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,000
sided

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
then we can infer something about the regional convergence

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
well in addition to right-sided

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
signals we can also have left sided signals

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Analects I did signal is essentially a right-sided signal turned around

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
in other words a left-sided signal is one

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
that is zero after some time

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
well we can carry out exactly the same kind of argument there

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
namely if the signal goes off to infinity in the negative time direction

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and stops

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
someplace for positive time if I have an exponential

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I can multiply it by and have that product be absolutely integral ball

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
but if I choose an exponential that decays even faster for negative times

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that I'm pushing the stuff

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
way out there down even further then

00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
II enhance the integrability even more

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
an you might have to think through that a little bit but it's exactly

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the flip side of the argument for right-sided signals

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and the conclusion and is dead

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
if we have a left-sided signal

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and we have a point a value up the real party best which is in the region of

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
convergence

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
then in fact all values

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to the left at that point in the S plane

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
will also be in the region of convergence

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
now solar to the statement that we made for right-sided signals

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
if expertise left-sided and in fact we're talking about a rational applies

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
transform which we most

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
typically well then in fact we can make the statement

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
there the region of convergence is to the left

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
of the leftmost poll because

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
we know it has if we find a point that's in the region of convergence

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
everything to the left then has to be in the region of convergence

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
we can have any polls in the region of convergence you put those two statements

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
together and it says

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is to the left the leftmost poll

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
now the final situation is the situation where

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
we have a signal which is neither right side or left side it goes off to

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
infinity for positive time

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and it goes off to infinity for negative time and their the thing to kinda

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
recognizes that

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
if you multiply by an exponential and its decaying

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
very fast for positive time it's gonna be growing very fast for negative time

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
conversely if it became very fast for negative time is growing very fast for

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
positive time

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and this kind of this notion of trying to balance the value Sigma

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and in effect with that says is that the region of convergence can't

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
extent too far to the left or too far to the right

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
said another way for a two-sided

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
signal and if we have a point which is in the region of convergence

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
than that point defines

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
strip in the ass plane dead takes

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that point and extends it to the left until you bump into a pole

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
an extensive to the right until you bump into a pole

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
fight so he you begin today and see that

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
we can tie together some properties in the region of convergence

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and the right-sided mister left-sided mister two-sided NIS

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
love the time function and you have a chance to examine that

00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
in more detail in the video course manual

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
let's conclude this lecture by talking about

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
how we might get the time function

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
given the low class transformed

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
well if we have a plus transform we can

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
in principle get the time function back again by

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
recognizing this relationship between the applause transform

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and the 48 transform and using the formal for EA transform expression

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
or quietly the formal inverse Laplace transform

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
expression which is in the tax but more typically what we would do is

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
what we've done also with the Fourier transform

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
which is to use simple

00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
plus transform pairs together with the notion

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
all the partial fraction expansion and

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
let's just go through that with an example

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
let's suppose that I have

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
a a-plus transform as i indicated here

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and its polls are applied and a region of convergence which

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
is to the right if this poll and what we can identify

00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
from the region of convergence in fact is that we're talking

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
about a right-sided time function

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
so the rear richer convergence is the real party best greater than -1

00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and now looking down at the algebraic expression

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
we have the algebraic expression for this is i indicate here

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
acquittal on tlie expanded in a partial fraction expansion

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
as a show below so if you just simply combine these together

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
that's the same as this and the region of convergence

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
is the real party bass greater than -1

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
now the region of convergence or

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
this is a solid to turn so the the time function is this summer to time

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
functions

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and the region of convergence

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
all love the combination must be

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the intersection of the region of convergence associated with each one

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
recognizing that this is to the right of the polls

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that tells us immediately that each of these two

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
then would correspond to bill plus transform

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
love a right-sided time function

00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
well let's look at it term by term

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
the first term is the factor 1 over s plus one

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
with the region of convergence to the right if this poll

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and this hat algebraically

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
corresponds to what i've indicated and this in fact

00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
is similar to or special case if the

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
example that we pointed to at the beginning at the lecture namely example

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
9.1

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and so we can just simply use that result if you think back

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
to that example or refer to your notes we know

00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
dead time function of the form

00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
eat to -80 gives us all a plus transform which is one over S Plus

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
a with the real party bass greater than

00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
minus a and so this is the applause transformer the first

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
or sorry this is the inverse the poss transform the first term

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
if we now consider the poll add

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
s equals -2

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and here is the region of convergence that we originally began with

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
in fact we can having removed the pole at -1

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
extend this region of convergence

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
to this poll and we now have

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
an algebraic expression which is -1 over s plus

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
to the real party best greater than -1

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
although in fact we can extend the region of convergence

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
up to the poll and the inverse

00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
transformer this is now again

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
referring to the same example minus you to the -2 T

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
times a unit step and if we simply

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
put the two turns together then

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
adding the one that we have here to what we had before

00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
we have a total inverse Laplace transform

00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
which is that

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
so essentially what's happened is dead

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
each of the ex each over the polls has contributed

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
an exponential factor and because if the region of convergence

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
being to the right of all those polls that

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
is consistent with the notion that both of those terms correspond to right-sided

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
time functions

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
well it's just the focus for

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
for a second or two on the same

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Posey role pattern but instead I love

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
a region of convergence which is to the right at the polls

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
as we had before well now take a region of convergence which is between the two

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
poles

00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and I'll let you work through this more leisurely

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
in the video course manual but when we carry out the partial fraction expansion

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
as I've done below

00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
we would now associate with this poll

00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
a regional convergence to the right with this poll

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
a region of convergence to the left

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and so while what we would have

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
is the sum love a right-sided time function due to this poll

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and in fact that serve the form you to the minus T

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
pretty positive and a left-sided

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
type function due to this poll

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and in fact that serve the form in the minus two TV

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
pretty negative and so in fact

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
the answer that we will get when we decompose this

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
use the partial fraction expansion being very careful

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
about associating the region of convergence

00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
this poll to the right and if this poll to the left

00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
will have then when we're all done a time

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
function which will be of the form eats the minus

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
T times a unit step pretty positive

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and then we'll have a term of the for me

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
to the I'm sorry this would-be to the minus 2 T's since this is at -2 in this

00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,000
is

00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
-1 this would be a plus sign in this would be minus

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
you to the minus the for TE negative

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and you look at that a little more carefully when

00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I you sit down with the video course manual

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
okay well what we've gone through rather quickly is

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
an introduction to the applause transform

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and a couple points to underscore again

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
is the fact that the applause transform is very closely associated

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
with the Fourier transform and in fact the applause transform

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
4s equals jail maker reduces to the 48 transform

00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
but more generally the a-plus transform is the 48 transform

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
love x50 with

00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
an exponential weighting and there are some exponentials for which that product

00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
converges there are other exponentials for which

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
that product has a Fourier transform that doesn't converge

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
bad then imposes on the discussion above plus transform

00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
what we refer to as the region of convergence

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and it's very important to understand that in specifying a a-plus transform

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it's important to identify not only

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
the algebraic expression but also the values the best namely

00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
for which it it's valid namely

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
the region of convergence low class transformed finally what we did was to

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
tied together some properties over time function

00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
with things that we can say about the regional convergence office supplies

00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
transform

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
now just as with the Fourier transform the applause transformer has some very

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
important properties and I love these properties both

00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
are some mechanisms for using a fast transforming

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
for such such systems as linear cut those described by a linear cut the

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
coefficient

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
differential equations but more importantly

00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
the properties will help us as we understand the further

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
will help us in using exploiting

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
the appliance transform to study and understand

00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
linear time-invariant systems and

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
thats what will go on to next time in particular

00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
talking about properties and then associating

00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
with linear time-invariant systems much of the discussion

00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
dead we've had today relating

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
to the austrians 1 thank you
