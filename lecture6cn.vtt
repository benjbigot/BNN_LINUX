look at what the homogeneous solution this equation is
看看这个公式是什么样的均相溶液

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and so we can consider the homogeneous equation

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and what we're left with is an equation
而我们留下了什么是方程

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000

here again we can ask what the advantages to this
在这里，我们再次可以问什么优势，这

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
as opposed to the previous one and what you can see
相对于前一个，你可以看到什么

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
just as we saw with the difference equation is that
正如我们看到的差分方程是

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
now the integrators both integrators
现在集成两个集成

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
are integrating the same thing in particular
正在将同样的事情，尤其

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the input to this integrator and the input
输入至该积分器和该输入

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
to this integrator are identical so in fact
这个积分是相同的所以其实

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
rather than using this one we can simply tap of
而不是使用这一块，我们可以简单地挖掘

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
from here we can in fact remove this integrator
从这里我们其实可以消除这种集成

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
break this connection
打破这种连接

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and happy and at this point and so
和快乐，在这一点上，所以

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
what we've done and by interchange in the order in which the systems are
我们已经在该系统是为了完成和交流

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
cascaded
级联

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
is reduced the implementation to the implementation
被减少的实施，实施

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
with a single integrated very much similar to

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
what we talked about in the case the difference wage
我们的情况下谈到了工资差异

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
now let's just again with the integral equation
现在就让我们再次与积分方程

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
way the differential equation looked at
这样的微分方程看着

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
this somewhat more generally again
这个较为普遍再次

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
if we take the differential equation the general differential equation
如果我们把微分方程的一般微分方程

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
integrated a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation
集成的足够次数，将它转换为一个积分方程

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
we would then have this cascaded systems
那么我们将有这个级联系统

00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
and again if we assume initial rest
并再次，如果我们假设初始休息

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
so that these are both linear time-invariant systems
所以，这些都是线性时不变系统

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
we can interchange the order in which they are cascaded
我们可以交换它们被级联的顺序

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
namely take the second system and
即以第二个系统和

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
move it
移动

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to proceed the first system
进行第一系统

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and then we recognize is that the input to this change
然后我们承认的是，输入到该变化

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
integrators and this change integrators is exactly the same
集成商和这种变化集成是完全一样的

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and so in fact we can collapse these together
所以实际上我们可以一起折叠这些

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
using only one change integrators and the system
只使用一个变化集成商和系统

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
there we're left with then is system
有我们留下了然后就是系统

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that looks as i've indicated here so we have
看起来就像我在这里表示，所以我们有

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
now just a single chain integrators
现在只是一个单链整合

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is that a the two sets in
是，两组中

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case the
因此，我们已经看到，这种情况是非常相似的在这里，因为它是在情况下，

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
difference equation
差分方程

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
again why do we want to cut the number integrators in half
又为什么我们要削减的数量集成了一半

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
well one reason is because integrators in effect represent hardware
还有一个原因是因为在效果整合代表的硬件

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and if we use half as much if we have half as many integrators
如果我们用一半多，如果我们有一半多的集成商

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
then using half as much hard
然后用一半的硬

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
okay well let me just conclude by summarizing
还好还有让我通过总结得出结论

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
