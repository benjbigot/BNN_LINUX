15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,680 
the in the last several lectures we
talked about

16
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:02,540 
a generalization love the
continuous-time

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,900 
Fourier transform and a very similar

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,280 
strategy also applies to discrete-time
and that's what we want to begin to deal

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,650 
with in today's lecture

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,030 
so what we want to talk about is

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,440 
generalizing the four EA transform

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,649 
and what this will lead to in
discrete-time is a notion referred to as

23
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,750 
the sea transport

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,780 
now just as in continuous-time

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,530 
in discrete-time the 48 transform

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,880 
corresponded to a representation

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,270 
love a sequence as a linear combination

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,759 
love complex exponentials and

29
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,450 
so this was the synthesis equation and
of course there is the corresponding

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,880 
analysis equation

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,020 
and as you recall and as is

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,140 
the same for continuous-time the reason

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,310 
that we pick complex exponentials was

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,229 
because of the fact that their I can
functions of linear time-invariant

35
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,450 
systems

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,890 
in other words if you have a complex
exponential

37
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,530 
into a linear time-invariant system the
output is a complex exponential

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,770 
and the change in complex amplitude

39
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,250 
is which corresponds to the frequency
response

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,430 
in fact is what led to the definition of
the 48 transform

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,560 
in particular it is the Fourier
transform

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,090 
up the impulse response well

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,160 
that said have notions is more or less
identical to

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,580 
the way we motivated the look lost
transform

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,420 
in the continuous-time case in the 48
transforming the continuous-time case

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,769 
and just as in continuous-time there

47
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,379 
it are a set signals more general

48
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,630 
then the complex exponentials which

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,200 
are also I can functions have linear
time-invariant systems

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,010 
in particular and discrete-time if

51
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,150 
we had instead love an exponential

52
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,620 
you to the Chi Omega and we had a more
general

53
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,030 
complex number Z bad

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,230 
the signals E to the end is also

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,520 
and I can function up a linear
time-invariant system

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,330 
for any particular Z so

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,220 
and we can see that by substituting that
it to the convolution some

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,260 
and recognizing again very strongly
paralleling the

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,800 
continuous-time argument head we can

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,860 
rewrite this factor as Z to the N

61
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,490 
the to the minus K and

62
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,650 
because it the fact that it's a someone
and are some on K

63
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,270 
and his term doesn't depend on K we can
take that term out

64
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,020 
and the conclusion is that if we have

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,120 
Z to the end as an input that

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,340 
the output is love the same form times

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,670 
a factor which depends on C

68
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,250 
but of course doesn't depend on k cuz
that is

69
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,440 
some doubt as we form the summation so
in fact

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,859 
this some Asian corresponds to a complex
number

71
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,979 
which will do no as agency

72
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:28,580 
where Z will represent a more general
complex number

73
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,039 
namely see is are

74
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,400 
you to the jail maker are being the
magnitude of this complex number

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,180 
and Omega of course being the angle so

76
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,810 
for linear time-invariant system a more
general

77
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,639 
complex exponential sequence up this
form

78
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,800 
generates an output a complex
exponential sequence

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,240 
have the same form with a change in
amplitude

80
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,479 
which were representing as a gypsy

81
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,719 
recognizing the fact that it's going to
be a function of what that complex

82
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,059 
number is

83
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:11,229 
and this amplitude factor is given by
this some Asian

84
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,409 
and it is this some Asian which

85
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,120 
is defined as busy transform

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,080 
all the sequence H event

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,659 
now let me stress that and I'll continue
to stress this is the lecture goes on

88
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,249 
that much of what we've said is

89
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:35,809 
directly parallel to what we said in the
continuous-time case

90
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:39,830 
and what we simply done is to expand

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,559 
from complex exponentials with a purely
imaginary exponent

92
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:49,370 
complex exponential time functions are
sequences

93
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,499 
that form into one's that have more
general

94
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,960 
complex exponential factors

95
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,409 
now we have a mapping here

96
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,860 
from the impulse response to

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,779 
the Tampa to or the Aiken value

98
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,719 
associated with that input and this
mapping

99
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:16,120 
is what is referred to as busy transport

100
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,740 
so a gypsy is in fact

101
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,069 
busy transform of the impulse response

102
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,419 
and if we consider applying this mapping

103
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,710 
as we did in continuous-time in a
similar argument

104
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,909 
applying this mapping to a

105
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,789 
sequence whether or not it corresponds
to the impulse response to the linear

106
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,740 
time-invariant system

107
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,999 
that leads then to busy transform

108
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,279 
love a general sequence XFN

109
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,610 
busy transform being defined by

110
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,969 
this relationship and again

111
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,050 
rotationally will often represent

112
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,740 
a time for action and it's the transform
through shorthand notation

113
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,779 
just indicating that accepts the

114
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,990 
is this the transform love accident

115
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,300 
alright so we've kind of motivated the
development

116
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,559 
in a manner exactly identical to what we
had done with the a-plus transform

117
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,949 
kinda the idea that if you look at the
eigen value associated

118
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,949 
in with the linear time-invariant system

119
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,689 
that essentially generates a mapping
between

120
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,210 
the sequence impulse system impulse
response

121
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,430 
and a function of Z and

122
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,849 
that corresponds to busy transform here
at corresponded to applause transform

123
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,849 
in a continuous-time case that same
argument

124
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,860 
is also the argument the kinda argument
that we use

125
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,909 
to lead us into before EA transform

126
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:54,689 
originally an once again what you would
expect

127
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,809 
is dead busy transform has a very close

128
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,819 
an important relationship to the Fourier
transform

129
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,139 
and indeed that relationship turned down

130
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,559 
to be more or less identical to

131
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,680 
the relationship between the applause
transform

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,430 
in the 48 transforming continuous-time

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,629 
well let's look at the relationship

134
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,719 
for civil what we recognize is

135
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,319 
they if we compare

136
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,460 
the for EA transform expression

137
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,409 
for a sequence and busy transform

138
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,649 
expression for the same sequence

139
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,770 
dead they involve essentially the same
operations

140
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,200 
and in fact Cincy is of the form are

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,720 
e2 the jail maker if we want

142
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,740 
this some to look like this some

143
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,910 
then that would mean that we would
choosy

144
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,770 
equal to either the jail maker said
another way

145
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,580 
busy transform onesie is a to the J
Omega

146
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,950 
is going to reduce to before EA
transform

147
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,540 
so we have relationship like the one

148
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,070 
again we had between the law applies
transforming the forty a transforming

149
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,690 
continuous-time

150
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,130 
namely dead for certain set values

151
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,980 
of the complex variable the transform
busy transform reduces

152
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,199 
to the Fourier transform so if we have
ecstasy

153
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:33,680 
busy transform and we look at that

154
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,579 
for see equal to either the jail maker

155
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,649 
and sequel to you to jail maker is

156
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,110 
similar to saying that we're looking at
that for the magnitude of Z

157
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,350 
equal to 1 were specifically choosing
are equal to one which is the magnitude

158
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,910 
see then this is equal to

159
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,300 
the four EA transform love the sequence

160
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,399 
so busy transform frazee

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,459 
equal to either J Omega is the Fourier
transform

162
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:09,190 
and so this then corresponds to

163
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,990 
X love Omega namely the Fourier
transform

164
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,660 
well we now have ourselves in a similar
situation

165
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,810 
again to what we had when we talked
about the applause transform

166
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,170 
namely a notational

167
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,490 
awkwardness or inconvenience which we
can resolve by simply

168
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,860 
re defining some of our notation

169
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,000 
in particular the awkwardness relates to
the fact that

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,990 
whereas we've been writing or 48
transforms this way

171
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,050 
as external make a if

172
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,529 
we were to express XZ and look at it
it's equal to either the jail maker

173
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,310 
we end up with the independent variable
be2 the jail maker

174
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,329 
rather than Omega well in fact

175
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,660 
the 48 transform is a functional Omega
it's also a function to be the jail

176
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,610 
maker

177
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,000 
and now we can see is dead given

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,370 
the fact that we want to generalize the
four the the

179
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,269 
for EA transformed to dizzy transform
it's convenient now

180
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,899 
to use as notation for the four th

181
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,110 
transform exit Z was equal to you DJ
Omega

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,649 
namely are Fourier transforms will now
be written as i've indicated here

183
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:30,089 
so just summarizing that our new
notation

184
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,230 
is dead the independent variable

185
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,720 
on the Fourier transform is now

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,089 
going to be expressed as EJ Omega rather
than

187
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,360 
as omega its a

188
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,480 
minor notational change but I recognize
the fact that

189
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,629 
its somewhat confusing initially and
takes a few minutes to sit down and just

190
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,759 
get it straightened out it's very
similar to what we did with the

191
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,449 
apostrophe in swarm

192
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:02,339 
but let me draw your attention to the
fact that

193
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,389 
in the applause transform the
independent variable that we ended up

194
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,040 
with

195
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,269 
in talking about the 48 transform

196
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,680 
is different then what we're ending up
with here

197
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,810 
in particular before we head J Omega

198
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,440 
now we have the to the jail make

199
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,740 
and the reason for that is simply that

200
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,860 
the whereas in continuous time we were
talking about functions are the four

201
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,459 
you to the st. now we're talking about

202
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,779 
sequences the form Z to the end

203
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,310 
alright so in we have one relationship
between the four EA transform and dizzy

204
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,959 
transform namely

205
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,259 
the fact that for the magnitude is equal
to 1

206
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:53,350 
busy transform reduces to the Fourier
transform

207
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,480 
now in the applause transform we also
had another important relationship an

208
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,750 
observation

209
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,220 
which was the fact that the

210
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,410 
applause transform was

211
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,839 
the Fourier transform love x50

212
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,259 
modified and how is a modified it was
modified

213
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,860 
by multiplying by a decaying

214
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,230 
growing exponentially depending on what
the real part a veces

215
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,439 
well we have a very similar situation
with dizzy transform

216
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:29,449 
in particular in addition to the fact

217
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:33,649 
that busy transform for a sequel the DJ
Omega

218
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,209 
reduces to the four EA transform we'll
see

219
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,769 
that this is a transform for other
values as the

220
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,019 
is the Fourier transform love

221
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,970 
the sequence with an exponential
weighting and let's see where that comes

222
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,209 
from

223
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:55,230 
here we have the expression general
expression for the transform

224
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,629 
and recognizing that see is a complex
number which were expressing in polar

225
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:01,389 
form

226
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,699 
as are you to the jail maker

227
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:08,689 
substituting that in this summation now
becomes

228
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:12,240 
exit Van are you to jail make it to the
minus an

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,829 
we can factor out these two turns are to
the minus and

230
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,790 
and into the minus J Omega and and

231
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,379 
combining the art a minus in with
excessive and

232
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:27,970 
and the in the minus J Omega en

233
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,029 
being treated separately what we end up
with

234
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,579 
is the summation that I have here

235
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:41,180 
well what this says is that the z
transform which is this

236
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,019 
at sea equal to re: to jail maker

237
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,560 
is in fact the four EA transform

238
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,209 
allo what

239
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,889 
it's the Fourier transform our love
xom.n

240
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,600 
multiplied by art to the -10

241
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,199 
so that is the expression

242
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,249 
that we have here and in continuous-time

243
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,499 
we had the applause transform is the
Fourier transform

244
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:15,699 
love X 50 you to the minus Sigma T

245
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:21,759 
here we have the Fourier transform
effective and art to the -10

246
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,810 
now something to just reflect on for a
minute

247
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,980 
is the bit because it tends to cause

248
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,709 
little better problem with the algebra
later on if

249
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:37,230 
your attention is drawn to it is that
we're talking about multiplying

250
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,899 
excessive and

251
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,939 
times are to the minus n the question is

252
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:48,189 
for are greater than one

253
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:52,899 
bizarre to -10 increase exponentially as
N increases

254
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,680 
it is a decrease we're talking about are
to the minus and

255
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,199 
if the matter if are is greater than one
of the magnitude of ours greater than

256
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,170 
one for example

257
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,779 
if it's equal to 2 are the minus and is
a half to the N

258
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:11,769 
and so in fact that decreases
exponentially or more generally

259
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,860 
the larger re: is the faster are to the
-10

260
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,040 
DK's with increasing in

261
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,309 
okay well let's just look at

262
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,470 
some examples love the the transform

263
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,620 
and examples that I picked again

264
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,069 
are examples directly out of the text
and so

265
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,329 
the details of the algebra you can

266
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:44,290 
look at more leisurely as you sit with
the textbook

267
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,199 
let's consider first the ball an
exponential sequence x7

268
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,769 
equals a to the N times unit step so
zero for negative time

269
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,209 
and an exponential for positive time

270
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,649 
in and the Fourier transform as we've
seen in

271
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,009 
earlier lectures is won over one minus a

272
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,550 
it to the minus jail maker but

273
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,280 
this doesn't always converge in
particular for convergence of the

274
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,030 
Fourier transform

275
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,780 
we would require absolute some ability
up the original sequence

276
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,189 
and that in turn requires that the
magnitude have a

277
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,020 
be less than 1 so the Fourier transform
is this

278
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,150 
provided that the magnitude have a is
less than one

279
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:34,330 
and what is the Fourier transform if the
magnitude a vase not less than 1

280
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,080 
well the answer is that in that case it
doesn't converge

281
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080 
right now let's look at the Z transform
busy transform

282
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,360 
is the some from minus infinity plus
infinity

283
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,170 
Aug a to the N see the -10

284
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,180 
times a unit staff the unit step will
change the lower limit 20

285
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,020 
so some from zero to infinity and this
is all the form

286
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,230 
eight times

287
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,480 
Z to the -1 to the N

288
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,360 
so we're summing from zero to infinity
eight times even minus 12 the N

289
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,400 
that some is one over one minus AZ the
-1

290
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,980 
but in order for that song to converge

291
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,330 
we require that the magnitude have a

292
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,690 
time see the -1 be less than 1

293
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,300 
now this is busy transform is the
Fourier transform

294
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,410 
love the sequence a to the N

295
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,840 
times are to the -10 and

296
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,620 
this statement about busy transforming
converging

297
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,170 
see transform converging is exactly
identical to the statement

298
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,870 
that what we're requiring is there the
magnet too

299
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,870 
%uh a times art to the -1

300
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,430 
be less than 1 where

301
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,900 
this represents the exponential factor

302
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,960 
that we have are that

303
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,100 
in effect is applied to the sequence so
that

304
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,010 
the 48 transform becomes the transform
and

305
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,060 
so if we put this condition we can
interpret this condition

306
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,780 
in exactly the same way day we interpret
the condition

307
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,120 
on convergence of the 48 transform

308
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,170 
right so from this six

309
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,730 
from what we've worked out here then
well we have

310
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,960 
is the see transform or

311
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,190 
a to the N times you have an is

312
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,740 
won over one minus AZ the -1

313
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,290 
that works for any bad you have a

314
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,560 
provided that we pick the value Z
correctly

315
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,930 
in particular we have to pick the center
values UVC

316
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,400 
so that what so that the magnitude obey

317
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600 
time 0 -1 is less than one

318
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,800 
or equivalently so that the magnitude of
the

319
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,480 
is greater than the magnitude a so

320
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,720 
Associated with busy transform

321
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,200 
of this sequence is this algebraic
expression

322
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,830 
and this set of values on C for which
data algebraic expression is valid

323
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,030 
and just as with the apostrophe its form

324
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,870 
this range values is referred to as

325
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,980 
the region of convergence love busy
transform

326
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,980 
now again

327
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,860 
as we saw with the apostrophe s form
it's important

328
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,870 
to recognize dead in specifying

329
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,970 
or having worked out the

330
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,570 
d trance 4ever sequence it's not just
the algebraic expression

331
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,440 
but also the region of convergence
that's required

332
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,700 
to uniquely specified

333
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,500 
to emphasize that further here is
example ten-point to from the text

334
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,360 
and if you work that went through what
you find is that algebraically

335
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,830 
busy transform love this sequence

336
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,130 
is 101 minus AZ the -1

337
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,340 
identical algebraically to what we had
up here

338
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,970 
but now with a region of convergence

339
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,220 
which is the magnitude of the less than
the magnitude have a

340
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,400 
in contrast to this example

341
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,280 
where the regional convergence was the
magnitude of the

342
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,830 
greater than the magnitude day

343
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,740 
alright so again requires not just the
algebraic expression

344
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,200 
but also requires specification

345
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,220 
the region of convergence and

346
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,520 
also as with the applause transform

347
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,620 
it's convenient in looking at

348
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,660 
the z transform to

349
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,340 
represented in the complex plane

350
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,730 
in this case the complex plane referred
to as the

351
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,170 
seaplane whereas in continuous time we
talked about the applause transform it

352
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,380 
was the S point

353
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,970 
Z of course because he is the complex
variable interns in which were

354
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,970 
representing the sea transport

355
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,480 
so we will be representing

356
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,020 
the z transform interns of

357
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,480 
representations in the complex plane

358
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,540 
real part an imaginary part

359
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,730 
but I've also identified a circle here

360
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,730 
and you could wonder well what's the
significance

361
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,840 
the circle recall

362
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,170 
dead in the discussion that we just came
from

363
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,790 
when we talked about the relationship
between is a transforming the 48

364
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,190 
transform

365
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,480 
busy transform reduces to the Fourier
transform

366
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,630 
when the magnitude of Z's equal to 1

367
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,620 
the magnitude is equal to 1 in the
complex plane is a circle

368
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,610 
and that circle in fact is a circle love
radius

369
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,350 
1 and so its on this contour

370
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,650 
in the seaplane that busy transform

371
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:41,220 
reduces to the 48 transform and we'll
see some additional significance to that

372
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,150 
as we go along just again emphasize the
relationship since

373
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,140 
and differences with continuous-time
with the a-plus transform is the

374
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,950 
behavior in the ass playing on the J
Omega axis

375
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,970 
dead corresponds to

376
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,120 
the Fourier transform here its the
behavior on the unit circle

377
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,990 
with busy transform corresponds to the
Fourier transform

378
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,320 
now we'll be talking as we did with a
plus transform

379
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,110 
we'll be talking very often about

380
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,750 
transforms which are rational at and
rational transfers as we kiss

381
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,300 
was we'll see represent systems

382
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,320 
which are characterized by linear cut
the coefficient difference equations

383
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,660 
and so 4

384
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,120 
the rational transfer for the rational
see transforms

385
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,030 
will again find it convenient to use a
representation

386
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,930 
interns opposes zeros and dizzy play so
let's

387
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,470 
in look at are example as we worked it
out

388
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,630 
previously example ten-point 1 and

389
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,710 
with this sequence

390
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,280 
busy transformers one divided by one
minus AZ the -1

391
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,600 
and we happen to have written it as a
function of Z to the -1

392
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,550 
clearly we can rewrite this by
multiplying

393
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,520 
numerator and denominator by Z and this
would equivalent leave NBC divided by

394
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,580 
see minus a

395
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,360 
and so if we were to represent this

396
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,440 
through a poll 0 plot we would have 0 at
the arch in corresponding this factor

397
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,470 
and a poll at Z equals a

398
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,940 
corresponding to the denominator factor
and

399
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,080 
so the poll 0 pattern for this

400
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,090 
is then a poll it's equal to a

401
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,180 
and 0 at the origin

402
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,720 
now let me just comment quickly about
the fact that we wrote

403
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,660 
that we've written this as one over one
minus AZ the -1

404
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,290 
and it seems kinda strange because
perhaps we should have multiplied

405
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,060 
through by C

406
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,070 
%uh let me just indicate dead

407
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,590 
as you'll see as you work examples it's
very typical for busy transform

408
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,660 
to come out as a function %uh Zeta -1

409
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,510 
and so very typically you'll get to
recognize

410
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,830 
dead things will be expressed in terms
of factors involving

411
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,210 
terms like one minus AZ the -1 rather
than

412
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,870 
factors are the foreign C-minus a
alright well

413
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,750 
here is the one example that we heard
referred to

414
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,670 
and if we consider another example

415
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,950 
the other example which was example
10.22

416
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,490 
consists love

417
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,640 
a an algebraic expression as i indicate
here

418
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,310 
but its region %uh validity is the
magnitude is the less than the magnitude

419
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,210 
have a

420
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,350 
and that corresponds to the same poll 0

421
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,370 
apply but a region of convergence

422
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,550 
which is inside this circle

423
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,540 
whereas in the previous case

424
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,360 
with the poll 0 plot we had a region of
convergence

425
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,610 
which was for the magnitude at sea
greater than the magnitude have a

426
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,160 
so these two examples this one and the
other one

427
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,860 
have exactly the same poll 0 pattern and
their distinguished by

428
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,810 
their regional convergence now

429
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,900 
notice incidently that in this
particular case

430
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,830 
the region of convergence includes the
unit circle provided that

431
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,820 
the magnitude have a is less than one
and so in fact

432
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,770 
that would say dead the sequence

433
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,280 
has 48 transform that converges namely
with the magnitude see

434
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,930 
equal to 1 whereas in this example

435
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,160 
the regional convergence does not
include the unit circle

436
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,580 
and so in fact we cannot look at Exit
see for the magnitude is equal to 1

437
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,670 
and so this example with the magnitude
have a less than 1

438
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,930 
does not have a Fourier transform the
convergence

439
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,170 
well assuming that the bank to give a is
less than one

440
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,960 
and the Fourier transform converges we
can in fact

441
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,570 
look at the Fourier transform by

442
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,430 
observing what happens as we go around
the unit circle

443
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,350 
we've seen as for the a-plus transform
interns observing what happened as we

444
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,400 
move along the jail make axis

445
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,130 
and here again we can use

446
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,310 
the vectors

447
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,080 
as we trace out the unit circle

448
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,680 
and in particular what we would be
looking at in this case

449
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,010 
is the ratio of the zero vector

450
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:54,190 
to the polls actor for example if we
were looking at the magnitude busy

451
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,270 
transform

452
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,890 
the magnitude is a transform with the
the ratio the like that this factor

453
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,990 
to the like that this specter

454
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,110 
and to observe the Fourier transform we
would observe

455
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,460 
how those vectors change in length

456
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,050 
as we move around the unit circle

457
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,930 
and as we move around the unit circle
what we were trace out

458
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,410 
interns the ratio the lights are those
vectors is

459
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,610 
the for EA transform

460
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,120 
okay well let's focus

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,370 
on that also in the context

462
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,000 
love a slightly different the
transforming dizzy transform here

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,450 
as we'll see in later lecture is this
the transform associated with the

464
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,430 
second-order

465
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,750 
difference equation it's a it has a
denominator factor which has

466
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,780 
which has two poles associated with it

467
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,130 
and so here if we assumed

468
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,320 
that the forty a transformer The
Associated sequence

469
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,760 
converge then again we would look

470
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,730 
at the behavior this as we moved around
the unit circle

471
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,470 
and the ratio the links at the
appropriate vectors

472
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,060 
would describe 4s the frequency response

473
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,390 
I'm sorry the Fourier transform so

474
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,260 
the Fourier transform magnitude would
consist the

475
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,370 
the ratio the lengths

476
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,950 
above the zero vectors divided by the
links to the poll vectors

477
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,440 
and one thing that we observe is dead

478
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,440 
as we move in frequency Omega in the
vicinity

479
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,230 
love this poll this poll fact there in
fact

480
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,220 
reaches a minimum length that would mean

481
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,820 
there'd its reciprocal would be maximum

482
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,460 
and then as we sweep past the lysate
these two vectors would increase the

483
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,200 
zero vector is a course

484
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,730 
would retain the same way no matter
where we were

485
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,390 
on the unit circle so in fact if we look
at the Fourier transform associated with

486
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,490 
this poll 0 pattern

487
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,580 
if this was for example the the

488
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,040 
for EA the represented the the

489
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,580 
see transform or the impulse response

490
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,300 
the linear time-invariant system the
corresponding frequency response

491
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,280 
would be what I plotted out below and so

492
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,460 
it would peak and in fact where it would
peak

493
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,860 
is in the vicinity above the frequency
location of the poll

494
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,960 
as I indicate up here

495
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,320 
so as we sweep past is this poll

496
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,560 
then in fact this 48 transform

497
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,650 
peaks well

498
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,840 
this notion love looking at the
frequency response as we move around the

499
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,180 
unit circle

500
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,180 
is a very important notion and it's
important to recognize that is the unit

501
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,160 
circle that we're talking about here
whereas before

502
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,680 
we were talking about the jail major
axis

503
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,030 
and to emphasize this further

504
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,280 
let me just show this example and in
fact

505
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,370 
the previous example with the

506
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,370 
computer display so that we can see the
frequency response

507
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,120 
as it sweeps out as we go around the
unit circle

508
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,510 
so here we have the poll 0 pattern

509
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,130 
for the second-order example and to
generate the Fourier transform

510
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,430 
we want to look at the behavior of the
polling 0 vectors as we move around the

511
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,760 
unit circle

512
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,220 
so first let's display the vectors

513
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,290 
and here we have them displayed to

514
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,860 
the point corresponding to zero
frequency

515
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,820 
and the magnitude of the Fourier
transform

516
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,360 
will be as we discussed the magnet to
the like that this 0 factors divided by

517
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,000 
the magnitude of the like that the poll
vectors

518
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,400 
shown below will be the for EA transform

519
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,820 
and we have the Fourier transform
displayed

520
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,190 
hear from 0 to 2pi rather than

521
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,490 
from mine despite supply as it was
displayed in the transparency

522
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,740 
because the periodicity the Fourier
transform

523
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,430 
both those are acquittal

524
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,660 
now we're sweeping away from I'll make
equal 0

525
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,580 
and the lengths on the pole vectors have
changed

526
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,690 
and that of course generates a change in

527
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,150 
the 48 transform and

528
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,730 
as we continue the process further

529
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,020 
if we increase frequency

530
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,970 
as we sweep closer to the location at
the pole

531
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,060 
the polls actor decreases in length
dramatically

532
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,040 
and net generates a residence in the 48
transform

533
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,530 
very similar to what we saw in
continuous-time

534
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,810 
now as we continue to sweep

535
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,230 
further what will happen is that

536
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,050 
that poll factor will begin to increase
in like that again

537
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,780 
and so in fact the magnitude of the
Fourier transform

538
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,319 
will decrease and we see that here

539
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:35,250 
as we sweep toward or making equal to
pie

540
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,879 
now notice in this process that the

541
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,149 
like that the zero vector is has stayed
the same

542
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,550 
because the fact that this 0 the zeros

543
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:50,639 
are at the origin and no matter where we
are in the unit circle the like that

544
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,429 
those factors is unity

545
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,389 
so they don't influence in this example
the magnitude but they would of course

546
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,420 
influence the face

547
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,300 
now we want to continue sweeping from
make people to pie

548
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,950 
around to 2pi and because the symmetry
in the Fourier transform

549
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,310 
what we will see in the magnitude is
identical to what we would see

550
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,000 
if we swept from a geek with the pie
back

551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,650 
clockwise who are making equal 0

552
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,940 
in particular now as we're increasing
frequency

553
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,200 
notice that the link love the poll

554
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,760 
vector associated with the lower half
plane poll is decreasing

555
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,800 
and so in fact that corresponds to

556
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,350 
to generating a residence as

557
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:42,620 
we sweep past that polo cation as we are
here

558
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,980 
and then finally that poll factor
increases in Lang

559
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,800 
as we begin to approach will make people
to 2pi

560
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,800 
or equivalent Lee as we approach Omega
equal to 0

561
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,580 
no finally let's also look at

562
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,280 
the for EA transform associated with

563
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,340 
the first order example that we
discussed earlier in the lecture

564
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,770 
and so what we wanted look at is the
four EA transform as the poll

565
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,900 
n0 vectors change once again

566
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,320 
the Fourier transform will be displayed
on a scale from 0 to 2pi

567
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,070 
frequency scale from 0 to 2pi rather
than mine despite a pie

568
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,560 
and we want to observe the poll n0
vectors as we sweep around the unit

569
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,730 
circle

570
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,050 
we display first the poll n0 vectors

571
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,730 
at Omega equal to 0 and

572
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,310 
as the frequency increases

573
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,940 
the polls vector increases in length

574
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,480 
zero vector since the zeros at the
origin

575
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,480 
will have constantly no matter where we
are on the unit circle although it would

576
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,010 
affect the phase which we are not
displaying here

577
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,270 
and so the principal affect the only
affect really in the magnitude

578
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,080 
is due to the poll vector as the
frequency

579
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,450 
continues to increase the poll vector

580
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,480 
increases in length monotonically

581
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,420 
in fact and so that means that the
magnitude

582
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,210 
above the 48 transform will decrease
monotonically

583
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:36,210 
until we get past Omega equal to pie

584
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,480 
here we are now at Omega equal to pie

585
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,690 
and when we continue sweeping past

586
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,170 
this frequency around to 2pi then

587
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:00,210 
we will see basically the same curve
swept out

588
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,220 
in reverse sense because the symmetry

589
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,590 
again if the 48 transform magnitude
sweeping from

590
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,920 
hi tu Pai is going to be equivalent

591
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,610 
with regard to the magnitude too
sweeping from pie

592
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,430 
back to zero and so now

593
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,350 
the poll vector begins to decrease in
length and

594
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,280 
correspondingly the magnitude of the
Fourier transform

595
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,820 
will increase and

596
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,210 
that will continue until we get around
to make people to 2pi

597
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,360 
which is equivalent of course will make
people 0

598
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,310 
and obviously if we continue to sweep
around again we would simply

599
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,230 
trace out other periods associated with

600
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:53,230 
the forty a transport

601
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,740 
well that hopefully gives you care some
feel for

602
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,240 
for the notion I love %uh sweeping
around the unit circle and of course you

603
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,120 
can see that

604
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,330 
dead because the circle is periodic

605
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,380 
as we go around and around of course
what would get is a periodic for EA

606
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,810 
transform which is

607
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:17,580 
the way for EA transforms are supposed
to be now

608
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,680 
the just is

609
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,510 
with the Laplace transform the

610
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,940 
region of convergence that the transform

611
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,850 
as we've seen in this example and

612
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,380 
is a very important part the
specification

613
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,720 
above busy transform and we can

614
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,890 
in talking about sequences near
transforms either

615
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,770 
specify the regional convergence
implicitly or we can't specify

616
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,930 
explicitly

617
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,430 
we can for example say what it is says

618
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,730 
let's say the magnitude easy being
greater than the magnitude a

619
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,980 
or we can recognize that the region of
convergence

620
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,600 
has certain constraints associated with

621
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,100 
certain properties love the time
function and

622
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,770 
in particular there are

623
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,840 
some important properties love the
region of convergence

624
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,300 
which allow us given

625
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,520 
bed we know certain characteristics at
the time function

626
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,520 
to then identify the region of
convergence

627
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,920 
by looking at the poll 0 pad for example

628
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,020 
we recognize that the region of
convergence

629
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,880 
does not contain any polls because the
fact that at polls

630
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,110 
busy transform in fact blows up

631
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:44,940 
and of course can converge at that point
furthermore

632
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,510 
the region of convergence consists love
a ring

633
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,970 
in the seaplane centered about the
origin

634
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,210 
recall there with a plus transform

635
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,840 
the regional convergence consisted of
strips in

636
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,220 
the S plane with the sea transform the
region of convergence consist suffering

637
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,680 
basically because if the fact that the
regional convergence

638
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,240 
is dependent on the magnitude of Z
whereas

639
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,200 
with a plus transform the region of
convergence was dependent on the real

640
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,060 
party vez

641
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,390 
the fact that is the magnitude of the
says

642
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,450 
in effect dead all values see that have
the same magnitude

643
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,740 
lie on a circle and so the regional
convergence you would expect

644
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,920 
to be a concentric ring

645
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,660 
in the seaplane furthermore as we've
already talked about and exploited

646
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,800 
actually convergence %uh the Fourier
transform

647
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,460 
is equivalent to the statement that the
region of convergence

648
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,720 
includes the unit circle in the play now

649
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,100 
in we can also associate the region of
convergence with issues

650
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,740 
about whether the sequence is a finite
duration

651
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,330 
alright cited or left-sided in and

652
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,070 
let's let me sir quickly indicate again

653
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,020 
what this I love the argument is if

654
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,730 
we have a finite duration sequence so
that

655
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,270 
the sequence is absolutely solvable and
therefore has a Fourier transform that

656
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,320 
converges

657
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,390 
then because of the fact dead it 0
outside some interval

658
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,450 
I can multiply it by an exponentially

659
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:37,120 
decaying sequence or by an exponentially
growing sequence

660
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,860 
and since I'm only doing is over a
finite interval

661
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,810 
no matter how I choose that exponential
will end up

662
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,900 
with an absolutely some herbal product
so

663
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,860 
if accident is a finite duration that in
fact the region of convergence

664
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,420 
is the entire seaplane possibly

665
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,940 
with the exception of the origin or
insanity on the other hand

666
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,190 
if the sequence is a right-sided
sequence

667
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,730 
then we have to be careful that we don't

668
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,870 
multiply by an exponential that grows
too fast

669
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,200 
for positive time or equivalent Lee in

670
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,860 
we have to might have to choose the
exponential so that

671
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,710 
it DK sufficiently fast for positive
time

672
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,860 
as a consequence if that for a
right-sided sequence

673
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:36,090 
if we have a value which is in the
region of convergence

674
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,390 
as long as I multiply by exponentials

675
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,680 
that DK faster than that for positive
time

676
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,000 
then also have

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,170 
convergence in other words all finite
values Z

678
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,800 
to which the magnitude it sees greater
than this so that the exponentials die

679
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,500 
of even faster

680
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,300 
will also be in the region of
convergence

681
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,700 
if we combine that statement with the
fact that there are no polls

682
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,860 
in the region of convergence then we end
up with a statement similar to what we

683
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,960 
had with the applause transform

684
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,430 
here the statement is dead if the
sequences right-sided

685
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,900 
then the regional convergence

686
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,300 
has to be outside the outermost poll
essentially because it has to be outside

687
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,230 
someplace and can include any polls

688
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,840 
finally if we have

689
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,180 
a left-sided sequence

690
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,980 
van the if we have a value which is in
the region convergence

691
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,240 
all values for which the magnitude see
is less than that

692
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,170 
will also be in the region of
convergence or if ecstasy is rational

693
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,100 
then the region of convergence must be
inside the innermost poll

694
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,730 
and finally if we have a two-sided
sequence

695
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,860 
then this kind of a balance between

696
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,240 
the exponential factor that we use and
so in that case

697
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,630 
then the region of convergence will be
ring

698
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,050 
in the seaplane and a essentially will
extend outward to a poll

699
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,730 
an inward to a poll so if we had

700
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,950 
an algebraic expression let's say as

701
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,550 
in we have here

702
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,280 
in then

703
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,970 
we can associate with that a region of
convergence outside this poll

704
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,770 
and that would correspond to a
right-sided sequence

705
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,580 
or we can associate it with it a region
of convergence

706
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,840 
which is inside

707
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,460 
the innermost poll and that would
correspond to a left-sided sequence

708
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,410 
and the third and only other possibility

709
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,480 
is a region of convergence which

710
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,090 
lies between these two poles and

711
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,010 
that would then correspond to a
two-sided sequence

712
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,220 
noticed incidentally because that way
right place these polls

713
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,170 
that this is the only one for which the
regional convergence includes the unit

714
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,150 
circle

715
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:17,200 
in other words it's the only one for
which the Fourier transform convergence

716
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,060 
okay now we move through that fairly
quickly and

717
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,340 
a I've emphasize the fact that it
parallels very closely what we did

718
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,690 
with the a-plus transform what I'd like
to do

719
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,140 
is just conclude with a discussion of

720
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,950 
how we get the time function back again

721
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:42,070 
when we have busy transform including
its regional convergence

722
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,600 
well we can first the ball develop a
more less formal expression

723
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,450 
and the algebra for this is going
through in the text and you went through

724
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,570 
something similar

725
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,840 
to this with the applause transform in
the video course manual so I won't carry

726
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,340 
through the details

727
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:05,170 
but basically well we can use to develop
a formal expression is the fact

728
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,270 
that dizzy transform is the Fourier
transform

729
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,270 
the sequence exponentially weighted so
we can apply the inverse

730
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,270 
transformed to that and

731
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,720 
that gives is not active and protective
an exponentially weighted

732
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,810 
and if we track that through then what
we'll end up with

733
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,780 
is an expression after we've taken care
of

734
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,840 
few the app's lines and deltas will end
up with an expression

735
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,840 
that expresses formally

736
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,220 
the sequence XFN interns

737
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,620 
love busy transform where

738
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,390 
this in fact is a cock to her in a goal
in the complex plane

739
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,680 
and so there's a formal expression just

740
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,280 
as there's a formal expression for the
apostrophe its form

741
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,100 
but in fact the more typical procedure
is

742
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,620 
to use essentially transform pairs that
we know

743
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:07,370 
together with the idea of using a
partial fraction expansion

744
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:13,400 
so if we had a sequence if we had a see
transformers I indicate here

745
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,970 
and if we expanded out

746
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,400 
in a partial fraction expansion

747
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,560 
then weekend recognize as

748
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,880 
we did in a similar style with the lip
gloss transform

749
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,610 
we can recognize dead each term

750
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,860 
together with the identified region of
convergence

751
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,180 
corresponds to an exponential factor

752
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,920 
and so this term together with the fact
that we know that the magnitude of C

753
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,050 
must be greater than to allows us

754
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,240 
to recognize this as similar to

755
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,730 
the example ten-point 1 and in
particular than

756
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,950 
the sequence associated with that is
what I indicate here

757
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,220 
and for the second term the sequence is

758
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,640 
what I indicate here so

759
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,130 
what we're simply doing is using the
fact that

760
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,770 
we've worked out big the example going
one direction before

761
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,230 
and now we use that together with the
partial fraction expansion

762
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,050 
to get the individual sequences back
again

763
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,850 
and then at them together is one other
method which I'll just point to

764
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:31,410 
which eg is also elaborated on a little
more in the text

765
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,840 
but it's kind of the idea I love
developing the inverse

766
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,920 
Z transformed by recognizing dead

767
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,570 
this the transformer formula

768
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:46,910 
in fact is a power series

769
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:51,060 
so if we take exigency

770
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,160 
and expanded into power series

771
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,700 
then we can pick of the values affect
the van

772
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,310 
by identifying the individual
coefficients

773
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,540 
in this expansion

774
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:11,420 
okay and so by simply doing long
division for example

775
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,720 
we can also get the inverse transform

776
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,010 
and that by the way is very useful
particularly

777
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,510 
if we want to get the inverse see
transform

778
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,460 
for z transform expression which is not
rational

779
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,130 
right now we move through this fairly
quickly on the other hand I stress

780
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,080 
dead it's very similar to what we went
through for the applause transform

781
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,210 
except

782
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,350 
for a very important difference

783
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:46,200 
the principal difference really being
that with a plus transform it was the J

784
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,590 
Omega axis and the S plane

785
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,980 
that we focused attention on when we're
thinking about the Fourier transform

786
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,660 
here the unit circle in the seaplane
plays an important role

787
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,610 
well we'll see when we continue this in
the next lecture is dead

788
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,250 
there are properties are busy transform

789
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,600 
just as they were properties of us
transform

790
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,840 
and those properties allow us

791
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840 
to develop and exploit

792
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,020 
busy transform in the context love

793
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,170 
systems describable by when your
constant coefficient difference

794
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,240 
equations

795
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,540 
so in the next lecture will focus on

796
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,200 
some properties busy transform and then
we'll see

797
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,240 
how to use those properties to help us

798
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,020 
in getting further insight and working
with system

799
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,880 
describe a wall by difference equations
