the new the

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,140 
last time we began the discussion

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,229 
love z transform and

13
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,890 
as with the La Paz transforming
continuous time we developed it

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,409 
as a generalization of the Fourier
transform the

15
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,960 
expression that we got to dizzy
transform is

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,869 
the some that I indicate here and

17
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,750 
we also briefly talked about and in
Bercy transform

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,149 
integral and some other informal methods

19
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,030 
love computing the inverse eat transform
but

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,500 
we focused in particular on the
relationship between busy transform

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,530 
and the Fourier transform pointing out

22
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,990 
first the ball dead busy transform

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,280 
when we choose the magnitude is the

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,670 
equal to 1 so the magnitude is the the
for

25
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,640 
you to the jail maker just simply
reduces

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,859 
to the 4e a transformer the sequence

27
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,420 
then in addition we

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,840 
explored busy transform foresee more
general complex number

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,289 
and in a discrete-time z transform case

30
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,890 
we expressed that complex number in
polar form

31
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,810 
as our you DJ Omega and

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,630 
recognized dead busy transform
expression

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,380 
in fact corresponds to the four EA
transform

34
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,440 
love the sequence exponentially weighted
and

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,090 
because I love the exponential weighting
the

36
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,549 
see transform converges for some

37
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,420 
values of our corresponding to some
exponential weighting

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,700 
and perhaps not for others and that

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,959 
led to a notion which corresponded to

40
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,700 
the regional convergence associated with
dizzy transform

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,519 
and we talked some about properties in
the region of convergence

42
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,099 
particularly in relation to the poll 0

43
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,700 
banner now the sea transform has

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,319 
a number all important and useful
properties just as the apostrophe s form

45
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,900 
does

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,060 
and as one part of this lecture what
will want to do in fact

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,750 
is exploit some of these properties in
the context of systems described by with

48
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,049 
your constant coefficient difference
equations

49
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,680 
the spur ticular properties said

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,599 
play an important role in that context
so the properties that I indicate year

51
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,000 
and in particular their is as

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,189 
with continuous time a linearity
property that tells us

53
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:38,860 
dead the busy transform a linear
combination of sequences

54
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,090 
in fact is the same linear combination
of busy transforms

55
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,549 
a shifting property that

56
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,620 
indicates dead dizzy transform

57
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,650 
Aug exit then shifted is busy transform

58
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,400 
all exit then multiplied by a factor Z
the -10 0

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,189 
and then the convolution property

60
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,379 
for which the z transform

61
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,780 
all a convolution sequences is

62
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,489 
the product all the associated see
transforms

63
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,030 
and with all of these properties

64
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,390 
of course there is again the issue love
what the Associated region of

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,530 
convergence is

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,180 
in comparison with the regional
convergence the original sequences

67
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,650 
and that is an issue this address

68
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,789 
somewhat more in the text and let's not
going to adhere

69
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,159 
with the

70
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,780 
convolution property the

71
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,219 
convolution property as in
continuous-time

72
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,990 
course provides a mechanism for dealing

73
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,909 
with linear time-invariant systems in
particular

74
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,280 
in the time domain a linear
time-invariant system

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,810 
is described through convolution namely

76
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,440 
the output is the convolution love the
input

77
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,070 
and the impulse response because of the

78
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,770 
convolution property associated with
busy transform

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,680 
z transform up the output is busy
transformer the input

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,140 
times the sea transform up the impulse
response

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,159 
and again very much the same as

82
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,589 
what we had in continuous-time and also
what we had

83
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:29,419 
in the context that the discussion with
the Fourier transform

84
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,250 
in fact because if the relationship
between busy transform the 48 transform

85
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,680 
busy transform all the impulse response

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,580 
evaluated on the unit circle in other
words for the magnitude is equal to 1

87
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,050 
in fact corresponds to the frequency
response of the system

88
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,130 
more generally when we talk about this
the transform

89
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,399 
are the impulse response we will refer
to it as

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:03,110 
the system function associated with the
system

91
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,120 
now the convolution property in these
other properties as i indicated

92
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,810 
we will find useful in talking about
systems which are described

93
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,140 
by linear constant coefficient
difference equations and in fact

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,140 
will do that shortly but first what I'd
like to do

95
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,279 
is to continue

96
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,810 
to focus on the system function

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,700 
for linear time-invariant systems and
make a couple comments

98
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,599 
that tie back to some things that we
said in the last lecture

99
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,330 
relating to the relationship between

100
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,800 
the region of convergence a system or

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,070 
I'll I'm sorry the regional convergence
a busy transform

102
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,039 
and the issue of how that

103
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,310 
where that is in relation to the holes a
busy transport

104
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,669 
now in particular we can draw some
conclusions

105
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,270 
flying back to that discussion about the

106
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,310 
polo cations 0 the system function

107
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,940 
in relation to weathered the system is

108
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,520 
stable and whether the system is causal

109
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,890 
in particular recall from one of the
early lectures way back when

110
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,190 
dead stability for a system

111
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,529 
corresponded to the statement that the
impulse response

112
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:32,390 
is absolutely some local furthermore

113
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,620 
when we talked about the Fourier
transform

114
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,300 
the Fourier transform all a sequence

115
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,490 
converges if the sequence is absolutely
some mobile

116
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,740 
so in fact the condition for stability

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,010 
and others I'll a system and the
conditions for convergence in the

118
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,990 
Fourier transform ovitz impulse response

119
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,289 
in fact are the same condition namely

120
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,360 
absolute some ability now

121
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,680 
what does this mean what it means is
dead

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,880 
if the Fourier transform converges

123
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,610 
that means that the z transform
converges on the unit circle

124
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,669 
consequently if the system is stable

125
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,740 
then the system function z transform the
impulse response

126
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,229 
Moss also converge on the unit circle

127
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,529 
in other words the impulse response must
have a 48 transform

128
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:33,500 
that converges soul for stable system

129
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,050 
then the region of convergence the
system function

130
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,599 
must include the unit circle in the
seaplane

131
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,160 
so we see how stability relates

132
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,269 
to the location all

133
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:53,990 
the region of convergence and we can
also relate causality

134
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,700 
to the region of convergence in
particular we know

135
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,140 
dead if system is causal

136
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,029 
than the impulse response is right sided

137
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,080 
for sequences right-sided the regional
convergence

138
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,089 
love it see transform must be outside
the outermost poll

139
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:19,459 
so for causality the regional
convergence services to function must be

140
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,709 
outside the outermost poll

141
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:26,709 
for stability the regional convergence
must include the unit circle

142
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,180 
and in fact we can also then draw from
at the conclusion

143
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,839 
dead if we have a system its causal
unstable

144
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,839 
than all polls must be inside the unit
circle

145
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,860 
because of the fact that the polls must
because the fact that the region of

146
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,389 
convergence must be

147
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:49,910 
outside the outermost poll and has to
also include the unit circle

148
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,129 
soul for example if we had

149
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,519 
let's say system with a system function

150
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,970 
as I indicate here

151
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,930 
with the algebraic expression for the
system function

152
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,560 
being the expression that I indicate
here with a pole at sequels a third

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,310 
and another poll as equals to an 8-0 at
the origin

154
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,439 
if in fact the system

155
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:26,579 
was causal corresponding to an impulse
response that's right sided

156
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,350 
this then would be the region of
convergence

157
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,209 
the system function alternatively

158
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,079 
if I knew that the system was stable
then I know that

159
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,810 
the region of convergence must include
the unit circle and so

160
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,649 
this would be then the region of
convergence

161
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,329 
and what you might now want to ask
yourselves

162
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,120 
is if instead the region of convergence

163
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,680 
for the system function is this there
and

164
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,689 
is the system causal first question

165
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,329 
second question is is the system stable

166
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,379 
remembering that for causality the
regional convergence must be outside the

167
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,759 
outermost poll

168
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,149 
and for stability must include the unit
circle

169
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,800 
all right now what I'd like to do is

170
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,269 
look at the properties

171
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,370 
love the z transform

172
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,459 
and in particular exploit these
properties in the context systems

173
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,579 
that are described by linear constant
coefficient difference equations

174
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:41,319 
and the three basic properties that play
a key role in that discussion

175
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,410 
are the linearity property

176
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,749 
shifting property and the convolution
property

177
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,439 
and and so the stand are the properties

178
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:55,980 
dead I want to exploit so

179
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,160 
let's do that by first looking at a

180
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,170 
first-order difference equation and in
the case

181
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,269 
love a first-order difference equation
which

182
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,529 
I've written as i indicate year no turns
on the right hand side but we could have

183
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,620 
terms of course in general

184
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,589 
so why am i sayi van -1 equals x seven

185
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,579 
and we can use the linearity property

186
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,699 
so that if we take this the transformer
both sides have this expression

187
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:33,490 
that will then be busy transformer this
term plus the transformer this term

188
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,660 
and so using those properties

189
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,350 
and together with the shifting property

190
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,579 
the property that tells us that the Z
transform I'll

191
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,449 
y ven -1 is see to the -1 times the
transformer y ven

192
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,370 
we then convert the difference equation
to an algebraic expression

193
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,870 
and we can solve this outbreak
expression for

194
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,499 
busy transform up the output in terms of

195
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:06,059 
busy transformer the input

196
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,509 
now what we know from the convolution
property

197
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:16,370 
is that for system the the chance for
the output is the system function times

198
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,389 
the transformer the input

199
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:21,589 
so this factor that we have then

200
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:24,670 
must correspond to the

201
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,009 
system function or equivalent Lee

202
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:32,180 
busy transform of the impulse response
the system

203
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,720 
and in fact then if we have this the
transform we could figure out

204
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,990 
what the impulse response that the
system is

205
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,189 
by computing or determining what the
inverse the transformants

206
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:49,220 
except for the fact that that expression

207
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,589 
is an algebraic expression and

208
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,720 
doesn't yet totally specified dizzy
transform because we don't yet know what

209
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,220 
the region of convergence is

210
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,730 
how do we get the regional convergence
well we have the same issue here as we

211
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,949 
have with the apostrophe in swarm

212
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:11,470 
namely the point dead difference
equation

213
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,769 
tells us in essence what the algebraic
expression is

214
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:22,059 
for the system function but doesn't
specify the region of convergence

215
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,749 
that is specified by either explicitly

216
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:30,100 
because it's one way or another we know
with the impulse responses

217
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,829 
or implicitly because we know certain
properties in the system

218
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,499 
such as causality and/or stability

219
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:42,569 
so if on a

220
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:47,670 
let's say a imposed on this system in
addition to the difference equation

221
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:54,670 
the condition all causality

222
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,449 
then what that requires is dead the
impulse

223
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,519 
response the right-sided or

224
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,160 
the region of convergence be outside the
outermost poll

225
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,589 
and so for this example that would
require then

226
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,089 
that the region of convergence
correspond to

227
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:18,249 
the magnitude is Z greater than the
magnitude a

228
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,899 
what you might think about is whether I
would get the same condition

229
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,019 
if I required instead that the system

230
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,480 
be stable and furthermore you could
think about the question of whether I

231
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,410 
could

232
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,069 
specify or impose on this system that if
the boat stable in causal

233
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,629 
the real issue let me just kind of point
to it is dead

234
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,749 
the answer to those questions relate to

235
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:48,139 
whether the magnitude a vase less than 1
with a magnitude is greater than one

236
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,040 
if the magnitude have a is less than one
and I specify causality

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,360 
that will also mean

238
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,499 
that the system is stable in any case

239
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,160 
given this region of convergence then
the

240
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,309 
impulse response is the inverse
transformer that see transform which is

241
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,230 
a to the end times you there

242
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,459 
right now let's look at second order
equation is a very similar strategy

243
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,779 
for the second-order equation the one
that I picked is

244
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,879 
love this particular form and I've
written

245
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,230 
the coefficients parametrically as i
indicate here for a specific reason

246
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,540 
which will see shortly again I can apply
this the transform

247
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,339 
to this expression and I've skipped

248
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,360 
an algebraic stepper to hear when I do
this then

249
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,579 
again you I use the when you're ready
property and a shifting property

250
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,899 
and I end up with this algebraic
expression

251
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:52,209 
if I now solve that to express why if
the

252
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,899 
in terms of exits the and a function of
Z

253
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:01,040 
then this is what I get for the system
function

254
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,220 
and in so this is now

255
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,020 
a second-order system function and will
have 20 that the origin

256
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,939 
and it will have two poles

257
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,290 
again and there's the question 0

258
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,380 
what we assume about the regional
convergence I haven't specified date yet

259
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,510 
but if we let's say assume that

260
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,720 
the reach dead the system is causal
which I will tend to do

261
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,620 
then that means that the region of
convergence is outside the outermost

262
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,820 
poll

263
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,410 
now where the polls well let me just
kinda vindicate

264
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,210 
dad if and you can verify this
algebraically

265
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,400 
I actually Jer dead

266
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,740 
if the cosine beta term

267
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,090 
is less than 1

268
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,470 
then the roots of this polynomial

269
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,980 
will be complex and in fact the polls

270
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,600 
are at are eat a plus or minus J theta

271
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,990 
soul for Cosi pay to less than 1% then

272
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,670 
the polls are complex and

273
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,250 
the complex polls at an angle theta and

274
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,670 
with a distance from the origin equal to
the parameter are

275
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,690 
so in fact let's just look at that

276
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,980 
and what I show here is the

277
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,640 
poll 0 pattern

278
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,750 
assuming that are is less than one

279
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,710 
and that cosine data is less than one

280
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,680 
and we have a complex poll pair shown
here

281
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,340 
and now if we we assume that the system
was causal

282
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,510 
that means that the region of
convergence is outside these polls

283
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,640 
and that would then include the unit
circle

284
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,060 
which means that the system is also
stable

285
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,410 
and in fact as long as the region of
convergence includes the unit circle

286
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,710 
we can also talk about the

287
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,950 
frequency response of the system namely
we can evaluate the system function

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,030 
on the unit circle and we in fact
evaluated

289
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,990 
the forty a transform associated with
this

290
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,040 
polls 0 pattern last time and recalled
that

291
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,780 
the frequency response then is one that
has

292
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,710 
a resident character with the resonant
peak

293
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,070 
being roughly in the the sanity love

294
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,610 
the angle of the Polo cation

295
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,480 
and as the parameter are very slight
Cesar get smaller

296
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,590 
this peak 10's to broaden as our

297
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:46,590 
gets closer to one the residence tends
to get sharp

298
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,120 
alright well this is now

299
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,700 
can a job look at busy transform and we
see very strong parallels to the

300
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,010 
low-cost rents form

301
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,370 
in fact throughout the course

302
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,600 
I tried to emphasize and it just
naturally happens

303
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,960 
that there are very strong relationships

304
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,880 
and parallels between continuous-time
and discrete-time

305
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,380 
and in fact at one point we

306
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,790 
specifically map from continuous I
discrete time when we talked about

307
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,050 
discrete-time processing of
continuous-time signals

308
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,920 
and what I'd like to do now is turn our
attention

309
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,190 
to another very important reason

310
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,410 
for mapping from continuous-time to
discrete-time

311
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,370 
and in the process of doing this what
will need to do is exploit

312
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,520 
fairly heavily the insight into wishin

313
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,860 
and procedures that we've developed for

314
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,140 
the La Paz transform and easy transport

315
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,530 
specifically what I would like to begin
is a discussion

316
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,720 
relating to mapping continuous-time

317
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,380 
filters to discrete-time filters

318
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,820 
or continuous-time system functions to

319
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,980 
discrete-time system functions now

320
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,270 
why would we want to do that well their

321
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,340 
are at least several reasons for wanting
to Mac continuous-time

322
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,760 
filters to discrete-time filters one of
course is the fact that

323
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,220 
in some situations what we're interested
in

324
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,970 
doing is processing continuous-time
signals

325
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,000 
with discrete-time systems or

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,100 
said another way simulate
continuous-time

327
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,550 
systems with discrete-time systems

328
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,990 
and so would be natural in a setting
like that to think a mapping the

329
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,240 
the desired continuous I filter to a
discrete-time

330
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,490 
told so that's one very important
context

331
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,740 
is another very important context in
which

332
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,900 
this is done and then is in the con- it

333
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,270 
or in the in the context or

334
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,540 
for the purpose all exploiting

335
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,150 
establish design procedures for
continuous five filters

336
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,770 
the point is the following: we may or
may not

337
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,360 
be processing it a sample
continuous-time signal with our

338
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,780 
discrete-time salter maybe just be
discrete-time signals that we're working

339
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,430 
with

340
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,690 
but in that situation

341
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:38,280 
still we need to design the appropriate
discreet I filter

342
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,100 
historically their is a very

343
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,280 
rich history

344
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,630 
associated with design a continuous-time
filters

345
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,980 
and in many cases it's possible

346
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,640 
and very worthwhile and efficient to

347
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,900 
take those designs and map dome

348
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,880 
to discrete-time designs to use them as
discrete time filters

349
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840 
so another very important reason for
talking about the kinds mappings there

350
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,830 
we will be going into

351
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,610 
is this simply take advantage I love
what has been done historically

352
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,620 
in the continuous-time case

353
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,680 
all right now if we want to map

354
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,760 
continuous I filters to discrete-time
filters

355
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,670 
then in continuous-time we're talking
about a system function

356
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,270 
and an associated differential equation

357
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,570 
and indiscreet I'm there is the
corresponding

358
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,420 
system function and the corresponding

359
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,980 
difference equation and

360
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,360 
basically what we want to do is generate

361
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,010 
from a continuous-time system

362
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,610 
in some way a discrete-time system that

363
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:05,630 
meets in dissociated set ok desired
specifications

364
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,170 
now there's certain constraints that its

365
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,650 
reasonable an important to impose on

366
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,840 
whatever kinds mappings we use

367
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,880 
obviously wanna mapping that will take
are continuous-time system function

368
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,360 
and map it to a discrete-time system
function correspondingly in the time

369
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,160 
domain

370
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,280 
their is a continuous-time impulse
response

371
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,610 
that maps to the Associated
discrete-time impulse response

372
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,730 
these are more less natural the two that
are important and

373
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,470 
sometimes easy to lose sight of are the
two that I indicate here

374
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,050 
in particular if we r mapping

375
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,660 
a continuous-time filter with let's say
a desire desirable

376
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,810 
frequency response to a discrete-time

377
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:03,050 
filter and we would like to preserve the
good qualities that frequency response

378
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,050 
as we look at the discrete-time
frequency response

379
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,250 
then it's important that

380
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:16,050 
what happens in the ass plane for the
continues type filter along the jail

381
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,860 
make axis

382
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,870 
relate in a nice way to what happens

383
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,990 
in the seaplane around the unit circle

384
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,800 
because it's this over here

385
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,250 
that represents the frequency response
in continuous-time

386
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,440 
and this contour over here that
represents the frequency response

387
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,590 
in discrete-time so that's an important
property we want

388
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,940 
have the J Omega axis to map

389
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,180 
to the unit circle another

390
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,610 
more less natural condition to impose

391
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,770 
is a condition that if we

392
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,410 
are assured in some way that our
continuous type filter is stable

393
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,970 
then we would like to concentrate on
design procedures that

394
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,550 
more or less preserved at and will give
us stable digital filters

395
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:13,000 
so these are are reasonable conditions
to impose on the procedure

396
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,370 
and what I'd like to do in the remainder
this lecture is look at

397
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,410 
to common procedures for mapping
continuous-time filters to discrete-time

398
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,420 
filters the first one that I

399
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,290 
want to talk about is one that in fact
is very frequently use

400
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,460 
and also one

401
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,780 
that as we'll see for a variety of
reasons is

402
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,830 
highly undesirable the second

403
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,760 
is one that is also frequently used and
as we'll see

404
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,800 
is arm in certain situations very
desirable

405
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,820 
the first one i wanna talk about is

406
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,860 
the more less intuitive simple

407
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,630 
procedure 0 mapping a difference
equation at

408
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,310 
differential equation to a difference
equation by

409
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,840 
simply replacing derivatives by

410
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,140 
differences and kinda the idea is that
it

411
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,890 
a derivative is more or less a
difference and there's some dummy

412
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,670 
parameter capital T that I've thrown in
here which

413
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,390 
I won't focus too much on but in any
case

414
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,110 
this seems to have some plausibility if
we take the differential equation and do

415
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,780 
this with all the derivatives

416
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,020 
on both in terms of wife tnx ft

417
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,550 
what we'll end up with is a difference
equation

418
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,230 
now what we can use are the properties

419
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,470 
love the boss transforming dizzy
transform

420
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,960 
to see what this means in terms of a
mapping a particular

421
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,390 
using a different ciation property from
a plus transforms

422
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,440 
in the a-plus transform domain we would
have this

423
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,030 
using the properties for

424
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,560 
busy transform busy transformer this
expression would be this

425
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,700 
and so in effect what it says

426
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,740 
is dead every place in the system
function

427
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,460 
or the differential equation that we
would be multiplying by S

428
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,990 
when we'll pass transformed in the
difference equation we would be

429
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,200 
multiplying by this factor

430
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,200 
so in fact what this means is that

431
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,950 
the mapping from continuous time to
discrete-time

432
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,600 
corresponds to taking the system
function

433
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,390 
and replacing s wherever we see it

434
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,650 
by one minus the to the -1 over capital
T

435
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,440 
and so if we have a system function in
continuous-time

436
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,550 
and we map it to a discrete-time system
function

437
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,060 
this way by replacing derivatives by
differences

438
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,270 
then that corresponds to replacing asked
by

439
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,380 
$1 -2 -1 over capital T

440
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,350 
now we'll see shortly what this mapping

441
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,580 
actually means more specifically in
relating yes plane to the seaplane

442
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,650 
let me just quickly because I want to
refer to this

443
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,810 
also point to another procedure very
much like backward differences

444
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,640 
which corresponds to replacing
derivatives not by the backward

445
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,150 
difference is that I just showed

446
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,700 
but by former differences and in that
case

447
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,370 
then the mapping corresponds replacing
asked by

448
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,790 
Zeta minus one over capital T

449
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,270 
looks very similar to the previous case
and

450
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,370 
so there the relationship between the
system functions

451
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,740 
is what I indicate here

452
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,490 
alright well let's just take a look at

453
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,720 
what that those mappings correspond to
when we look at this specifically

454
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,280 
in the S plane and in the seaplane brown

455
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,910 
what I show here is the s plane

456
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:08,250 
and chorus its things in the left after
the S plane posing left after the s plan

457
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,840 
that would guarantee stability

458
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,560 
its the chair make axis that tells us
about the frequency response

459
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,840 
and in the seaplane its

460
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,060 
the unit circle that tells us about the
frequency response

461
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,980 
and things inside the unit circle or
poles inside the unit circle to

462
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,150 
guarantee stability

463
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:35,340 
now the mapping from yes point to the
sea plane corresponding

464
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,320 
to replacing derivatives by backward
differences

465
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,010 
in fact can be shown to correspond

466
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,920 
to mapping DJ Omega axis

467
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,310 
not to the unit circle but

468
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:55,240 
to the little circle that I show here
which is inside the unit circle

469
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,450 
the left half oath the S plane maps to
the insider that circle

470
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,470 
what does that mean that means they had
if we have

471
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,480 
a really good frequency response

472
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,500 
characteristic along this contour

473
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,290 
in the S plane will see that same
frequency response

474
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,980 
along this little circle that's not the
one we want though

475
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,730 
we would like to see that same frequency
response around the unit circle

476
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,970 
to emphasize this point even more
suppose for example

477
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,410 
that we had appear polls

478
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:36,000 
in our continuous-time system function
that look like this

479
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,260 
then where they're likely to end up

480
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,610 
in busy plane is

481
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,500 
inside the unit circle of course by if

482
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,870 
the polls here are close to the jail
make axis

483
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,940 
that means that these polls will be
close to this circle

484
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,360 
but in fact might be very far away from
the unit circle

485
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,580 
so what would happen then is dead

486
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,710 
if we saw in the continuous-time filter
very sharp residence

487
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,400 
the discrete-time filter in fact might
very well have that residents broadened

488
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,410 
considerably

489
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,500 
because the polls is so far away from
the unit circle

490
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,870 
now 1 plus

491
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,960 
with this method and it's about the only
one

492
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,590 
is the fact that the left after the S
plane

493
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,540 
maps inside the unit circle in fact
inside the circle inside the unit circle

494
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,870 
and so stability is always guarantee

495
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,850 
let me just quickly mention and you'll
have a chance to look at this a little

496
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,230 
more carefully in the

497
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,600 
video course manual dead for

498
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,000 
forward difference is that a backward
differences

499
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,060 
this contour and yes plane

500
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,080 
maps to a line in the seaplane

501
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,880 
which is online tangent to the unit
circle

502
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,100 
and in fact is the line that I show
their

503
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,890 
so not only are for differences

504
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,620 
equally bad and turns at the issue
whether they mapped from the chair may

505
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,840 
get access to the unit circle

506
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,160 
but they have further difficulty
associated with them

507
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,180 
which is the difficulty dead

508
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:24,810 
they may not and generally don't
guarantee stability

509
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,390 
right now that's one method and

510
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,400 
I'll one as i indicated that so often
use partly

511
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,310 
I am a because it seems so intuitively
plausible

512
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,790 
and what you can see is that by
understand it carefully the issues and

513
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,120 
the techniques of apostasy transforms

514
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,860 
you can begin to see what some of the
difficulties with that method

515
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,410 
for those methods are the next method

516
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,730 
dad I'd like to talk about is a method
that in fact is very

517
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,210 
commonly used and it's a very important
useful method

518
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,560 
which Chynoweth can be motivated by
thinking along the lines of both

519
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,050 
mapping the continuous-time filter to

520
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,399 
a discrete-time sold their in such a way

521
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,629 
dead the shape up the impulse response
is preserved

522
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,760 
and in fact more specifically so that

523
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,490 
the discrete-time impulse response
corresponds to

524
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,980 
samples love the continuous-time impulse
response

525
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,040 
and this is a method that's referred to
as

526
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,270 
in polls invariance

527
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,369 
so what imposing variance corresponds to

528
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,619 
is designing the filter in such a way

529
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,089 
that the discrete-time filter

530
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:49,249 
impulse response is simply

531
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:54,329 
sample version love the continuous type
filter impulse response

532
00:34:54,329 --> 00:35:00,400 
with a sampling period which I do know
here's capital T

533
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,819 
and that will turn into a slightly
confusing parameter

534
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:08,029 
shortly and perhaps carried over into
the next lecture

535
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:11,190 
and hopefully we'll get that
straightened out though

536
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,819 
within those two lectures now
remembering

537
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:18,690 
the issues of sampling the discrete-time

538
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,279 
frequency response then since the
frequency response is the forty a

539
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,779 
transformer the impulse response

540
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:31,740 
is related to the continuous-time
impulse responses I indicate here

541
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,579 
and what this says is that it is

542
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:39,619 
the superposition

543
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:46,589 
all replications love the continuous
high frequency response

544
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:50,400 
linearly scaled in frequency and

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,670 
shifted and added to each other it's the
same old

546
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,230 
are so shifting ending a really is
saying issued the same sampling issues

547
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,039 
that we've addressed before

548
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,150 
well this equation will help us
understand what the frequency response

549
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,329 
looks like

550
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,640 
but in terms of an analytical procedure

551
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,700 
for mapping the continuous-time system
function

552
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,999 
to a discrete-time system function we
can see

553
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:22,210 
dat and develop it in the following way:

554
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,150 
let's consider the continuous-time
system function

555
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,240 
expanded in a partial fraction expansion

556
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,430 
and just for convenience on picking
first-order polls this can be

557
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,339 
general generalized or rather single
polls this can be generalized

558
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,359 
to on multiple order polls

559
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,200 
and we won't do that here the same basic
strategy applies

560
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,650 
if we expand this in a partial fraction
expansion

561
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,880 
and we look at the impulse response
associated with this

562
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,970 
we know how to take the inverse Laplace
transform with this

563
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,490 
where I'm just naturally assume because
our the throughout the discussion

564
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,569 
the continuous-time impulse response
then is

565
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,779 
someone exponentials with these
amplitudes

566
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:17,900 
and at these complex exponential
frequencies

567
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,589 
now impulse in various corresponds to
sampling this

568
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,529 
and so the discrete-time impulse
response

569
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:28,999 
is simply a sample version of this and

570
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,759 
in the AC cave course carries down

571
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:39,210 
and we have the exponential were
sampling at Eagles and capital T and so

572
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,809 
we've replaced that here and then the
unit step

573
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:46,049 
to truncate things for negative time

574
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:49,400 
right well let's manipulate this further
and

575
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,309 
eventually what we want to get is
relationship mapping

576
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:57,009 
from the continuous-time to the
discrete-time filter

577
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:01,609 
so we had this staff that we can rewrite
that

578
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,349 
now as I show here just

579
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,329 
simply taking this and outside we have
EDS

580
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,230 
k capital T so now this is %uh the for

581
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,359 
the summer terms like a suitcase me

582
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:22,069 
times fated to the N we can compute is a
transformer this

583
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:25,940 
and busy transform the week at I show

584
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,440 
here it's simply a sieve K over one
minus

585
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,759 
in the s2k capital T see the -1

586
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:36,249 
simply carrying this term or this

587
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:39,730 
this parameter down

588
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,700 
so we started with a continuous-time
system function which was the sole turns

589
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,700 
like a sieve K over s minus SFK the
polls were tested K

590
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,720 
we now have the day that discrete I
filter in this form

591
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,450 
and consequently then this procedure in
Polson variance

592
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,999 
corresponds to

593
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:05,660 
mapping the continuous I filter to
discrete-time filter

594
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,069 
by mapping the polls in the continuous I
filter

595
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,150 
according to this mapping

596
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:20,529 
the continuous part filter poll and SFK
gets map topo edited the s2k capital T

597
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:23,859 
and the coefficients a suitcase

598
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,069 
a are preserve

599
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:31,690 
and that an algebraically is what the
procedure of impulse and variance

600
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,579 
corresponds to

601
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,269 
okay well let's look at

602
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:41,690 
how we interpret summer this in the
frequency domain

603
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,859 
and in particular

604
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:49,779 
we have the expression that tells us how
the

605
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:53,200 
discrete-time frequency response

606
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,470 
is related to the continuous-time
frequency response

607
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,549 
this is the expression that we had
previously

608
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:05,339 
when we have talked about issues of
sampling

609
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,390 
so that means that we would form the
discrete I frequency response

610
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,890 
by taking the continuous-time one
scaling it

611
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,960 
in frequency according to this parameter
capital T

612
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,190 
and then Anne replications that together

613
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,089 
so if this is the continuous-time

614
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,920 
frequency response just simply an idea
low-pass filter with the cutoff

615
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,190 
frequency of omega-6

616
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,430 
see van the its

617
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,079 
frequency scaling operation would keep
the same basic shape

618
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,710 
but but linearly scale the frequency
axis so that we now have Omega sexy

619
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,930 
times capital T

620
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,559 
and then the discrete-time frequency
response

621
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,269 
would be a superposition at these and it
together

622
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:59,739 
at multiples of 2 pie indiscreet
time-frequency

623
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:03,319 
and so that's what we have here

624
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,170 
so this is the discreet I frequency
response

625
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,440 
so this looks very nice it looks like in
Polson variance will

626
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,049 
take the continuous I frequency response
just simply

627
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:21,200 
linearly scale the frequency axis and
incidently periodically repeated

628
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,710 
we know that for an idea low-pass filter
that looks just fine and in fact

629
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,269 
for a ban limited frequency response
that looks just fine

630
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:35,769 
but we know also that anytime that were
sampling

631
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:39,650 
here with sampling the impulse response
we have

632
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,920 
in effect in the frequency domain where
the potential for a second effect

633
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,730 
dead we refer to as alias so in fact

634
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,619 
if instead of the ideal low-pass filter

635
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:57,339 
we had taken a filter that was an
approximation to a low pass filter

636
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:01,339 
then the corresponding frequency scale
version

637
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:07,109 
would look as I've shown here and now as
we add these together

638
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,920 
then what we will have is some potential

639
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,170 
for distortion corresponding to the fact
that

640
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,279 
these replications overlap and

641
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:22,319 
what that will lead to is aliasing

642
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,299 
so some things that we can say about
imposing variance

643
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:29,880 
is there yet we have an algebraic
procedure at all

644
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,299 
illustrate with another example shortly
for taking a continuous I've system

645
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,170 
function mapping it to a discrete-time

646
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,989 
system function it has a very nice
property in terms of both

647
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,279 
a %uh mapping the mapping from

648
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:48,910 
the frequency axis in continuous-time
the to the

649
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,190 
unit circle namely

650
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,720 
to a first approximation as long as
there's no aliasing

651
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,119 
the mapping is just simply a linear
scaling the frequency axis although

652
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,009 
there may be some alias saying that
means of course that this method can

653
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:06,640 
only be used

654
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,619 
if the frequency response that's being
mapped work the system is being mad

655
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,799 
has a frequency response that's
approximately low-pass had asked to be

656
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:18,650 
approximately ban limit

657
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,839 
and then what we have is some

658
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,529 
pop potential distortion which comes
about because bailey's

659
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:30,630 
also because if the mapping the fact
that polls at soka

660
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:35,839 
get map to polls at you to the s2k
capital T

661
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,160 
if the analog a continuous-time filter
is

662
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,059 
stable meaning that the real party Vesta
case is negative

663
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:47,259 
then the discrete types author is
guaranteed to be stable

664
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:50,349 
in other words the magnitude as the
suitcase a

665
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:55,499 
will be guaranteed to be less than 1 I'm
assuming of course that discussion

666
00:43:55,499 --> 00:44:01,049 
we're are always imposing causality and
systems

667
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:05,529 
Bardwell to just look at the algebraic
mapping

668
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:09,650 
a little more carefully let's take a
simple example

669
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,239 
here is an example all

670
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:16,730 
a system a continuous-time system where

671
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,380 
I simply have a resident poll pair

672
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,829 
with a real with an imaginary part along
the

673
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,710 
Majuri accessible make it so far a real
part of mine a South

674
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:32,749 
for and so The Associated system
function and

675
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:37,029 
is just the expression which
incorporates

676
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:42,859 
the two poles and I put in a scale
factor to Omega so far

677
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:46,099 
and now to design the discrete-time

678
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:50,019 
filter using in Polson variance you
carry out a partial fraction expansion

679
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:51,690 
of this

680
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,989 
and that partial fraction expansion is
shown below

681
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:00,259 
we have a pole at minus South a-minus J
Omega are and at minus alpha plus Chi

682
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:02,119 
Omega are

683
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,259 
and to determine the

684
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:08,470 
discrete-time filter based on imposing
variance

685
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,460 
we would map the polls and preserves the
coefficients a Sat K

686
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,069 
referred to as the residues and so the

687
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:20,549 
discrete-time filter that we would end
up with

688
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,329 
as system function which I indicate

689
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,710 
here and we have is a

690
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,749 
said preserve the residue and

691
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:34,069 
the poll is now at either minus out the
TE

692
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:38,460 
you the vice chair makes a party that's
one term

693
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,619 
and the other term in Assam has a pole
at the complex conjugate

694
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,269 
location if we were to add these to

695
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:50,630 
factors together then what we would get

696
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,930 
is both polls and

697
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,390 
0 at the origin and

698
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,339 
in fact then the poll is defined by

699
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,410 
its angle and this angle

700
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,660 
is is

701
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,989 
eat see the J Omega so far

702
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:16,170 
capital see and by its radius

703
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,630 
and this radius is eat to the minors

704
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,759 
alpha capital T

705
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:27,549 
all right now we can look at the
frequency response

706
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:31,700 
associated with that and and let's just
do that

707
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,809 
for the original

708
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,970 
continuous-time frequency response

709
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,180 
what we have is simply a resident
character is a show

710
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,190 
as shown here and if we

711
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,960 
map this using your post in various
which we just did

712
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,980 
the resulting frequency response

713
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,690 
that we get is the frequency response
which I indicate

714
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,759 
we see that that's basically identical

715
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:06,839 
to the continuous-time frequency
response

716
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:12,130 
except for by a linear scaling the
frequency axis if you just compare

717
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:17,009 
the the dimensions along which the
frequency axis is shown

718
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:21,190 
and for one except for one minor

719
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,920 
issue which we switch is particularly
highlighted

720
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,190 
when we look at the frequency response
at higher frequencies

721
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,880 
what's the reason why those two curves

722
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,970 
don't quite follow each other at higher
frequencies

723
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,069 
well the reason is aliasing other words
what's happened

724
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:46,440 
is dead the in the process I'll

725
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,849 
applying in polls and variance the

726
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,489 
frequency response the original
continuous-time filter

727
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:57,559 
is approximately preserved except for
some distortion

728
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,380 
thats ocean correspondent aliasing

729
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,650 
well just for comparison let's look at
what

730
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,859 
would happen if we took the same example
and when I can work it through here

731
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:10,599 
carefully

732
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,119 
waco work through it all not even
accurately

733
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,489 
if we took the same example and mapped
it

734
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:24,599 
to a discrete-time filter by replacing
the rivet is by backward differences

735
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,160 
what happens in that case is dead we get

736
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,489 
frequency response that I indicate

737
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:35,210 
here and notice dat the resonance

738
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,430 
in the original continuous-time filter
is

739
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,089 
totally lost in fact

740
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,239 
basically the character love the
continuous-time

741
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:48,440 
frequency responses los what's the
reason

742
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,779 
well the reason goes back to the picture
that I drew before

743
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:55,249 
the continuous-time filter had a

744
00:48:55,249 --> 00:49:00,789 
pair love resident polls close to the
jail may axis

745
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:04,519 
when those get mapped using back with
differences they end up close to this

746
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,809 
little circle that's inside the unit
circle

747
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:14,440 
but in fact for this example are far
away from the unit circle

748
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,170 
alright so so far we have

749
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,380 
one useful technique for mapping
continuous I filters to discrete-time

750
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:28,259 
filters and apart to highlights are the
issues I focused attention also

751
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:31,749 
on some not so useful methods

752
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:37,619 
namely mapping derivatives to forward or
backward differences

753
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,269 
next time what I would like to do

754
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,460 
is look at impulse invariance

755
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,180 
for another example namely the design

756
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,359 
0 a Butterworth filter and all

757
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,930 
talk more specifically about what
butterworth filters or

758
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,809 
at the beginning that lecture and then
in addition

759
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:02,950 
what will introduce is another very
useful technique

760
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,660 
which has some difficulties which
imposed and variance doesn't have

761
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,289 
but avoids the principal

762
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:14,940 
difficulty that impulse in various does
have namely aliasing

763
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,299 
admitted is referred to as the violin
you transformation

764
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:22,640 
which we will to find and

765
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,339 
utilize next time thank you
