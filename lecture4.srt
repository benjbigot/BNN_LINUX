11

are

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,780 
the last lecture we discuss the number

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,520 
general properties for systems which

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,320 
as you recall applied both to
continuous-time

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,490 
and to discrete-time systems

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,400 
and these properties were the properties

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,640 
associated with the system having memory
the issue

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840 
love whether a system is or isn't
convertible

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,409 
we talked about causality instability

20
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,810 
and finally we talked about when the
arity

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,369 
and time-invariant in today's lecture

22
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,850 
what I'd like to do is focused
specifically on when the arity in time

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,729 
invariance

24
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,539 
and show how for systems that have those
properties

25
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,119 
we can exploit them to generate

26
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,890 
a general representation well let me
begin by

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,149 
just reviewing the two properties again
quickly

28
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,990 
time invariance as you recall

29
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,490 
is a property that apply both to
continuous-time and discrete-time

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,960 
systems

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,930 
and in essence stated bad for any given

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,610 
input and output relationship if we

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,950 
simply shift the input than the output
shift by the same amount

34
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,239 
and of course exactly the same kind of
statement

35
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,670 
applied in discrete-time so it i mean
variance was a property

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,940 
it said that the system didn't care
about what the time origin

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,540 
the signal is when the arity

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,420 
was a property related to the fact that
if we have

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,860 
et cetera outputs associated with a
given set of inputs

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,769 
as i've indicated here with the inputs

41
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,720 
as feasted K and the output decisive K

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,180 
then the property of when the arity

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,690 
States that if we have an input

44
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,359 
which is a linear combination up those
inputs

45
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,870 
then the output is

46
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,870 
a linear combination of the Associated
outputs

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,720 
so that linear combination of inputs

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,000 
generates for linear system at the end
output which is

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,200 
a linear combination up the Associated
outputs now

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,810 
the question is how can we exploit the
properties have many arity

51
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,110 
and time-invariant and there's a basic
strategy

52
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,580 
which will flow more or less through
mostly this court's

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,580 
the strategy is to

54
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,690 
attempt to decompose the signal you the
continuous-time and discrete-time

55
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,959 
into it said a basic signals

56
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,280 
and I've indicated that

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,190 
here and the question then

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,610 
is what basic signal should we pick well

59
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,470 
the answer kinda is we should pick said
a basic signals

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,000 
they provide a certain degree have
analytical convenience

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,150 
so we choose instead of inputs for the
decomposition

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,330 
bad provide outputs

63
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,989 
that we can easily generate now and
we'll see

64
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,630 
when we do this there are to

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,840 
classes love inputs that are
particularly suited

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,440 
to that strategy one class is

67
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,260 
the set love the late impulses namely

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,500 
decomposing a signal into a linear
combination if the

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,740 
is and as we'll see that leads to a
representation

70
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,479 
for linear time-invariant systems which
is referred to

71
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,740 
as convolution a second

72
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,880 
is a decomposition of inputs into
complex exponentials

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,080 
a linear combination of complex
exponentials

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,970 
and that leads to a representation

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,070 
love signals and systems through what
will refer to as

76
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,590 
for your analysis now

77
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,190 
four-day analysis will be a topic for

78
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,279 
a setup later lectures but I'd like to
begin with

79
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,120 
is the representation in terms of
impulses and the associated description

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,210 
linear time-invariant systems using
convolution

81
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,690 
so let's begin where

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,200 
a discussion are discrete-time signals

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,560 
and in particular the issue of how
discrete-time signals

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,770 
can be decomposed as a linear
combination

85
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,760 
love the lady impulses

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,599 
well in fact it's relatively
straightforward

87
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,080 
what I've shown here is a general

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,460 
sequence with values which i've
indicated

89
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,260 
at the top and more or less

90
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,020 
as we did when we talked about
representing

91
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,349 
a unit step in terms of impulses

92
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,320 
we can think of this general sequence as
a sequence

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,919 
I'll impulses delayed

94
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,960 
namely occurring at the appropriate

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,979 
prime instant and and with the
appropriate ample to

96
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,729 
so we can think love this general
sequence

97
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,880 
as and im polls occurring at an equal 0

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,969 
and and with the high dive exit 0

99
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:31,940 
plus and im polls all quite active one

100
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,849 
occurring at time n equals 1 and so
that's active one time

101
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,580 
Delta than -1 and in polls at -1

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,770 
with an amplitude love exit -1

103
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,010 
et cetera so if we continue

104
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,510 
to generate a said Oh waited the late
unit samples like that

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,610 
and if we had all these together

106
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,120 
then that will generate the total
sequence

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,770 
algebraically then what that corresponds
to

108
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,010 
is representing the sequence as

109
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,020 
some love individual turns over as i've
indicated here

110
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,430 
or in terms over general thumb

111
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,860 
the song %uh exit K felt the then minus
K

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,529 
so that's our strategy the strategy is
to decompose

113
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,640 
an arbitrary sequence into a linear
combination

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,589 
or waited too late impulses and here

115
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,149 
again is the representation which we
just

116
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:37,149 
finish generating

117
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:41,370 
now why is this representation useful

118
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,149 
it's useful because we now have a
decomposition at the sequence

119
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,810 
as a linear combination all basic

120
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,089 
sequences namely that the late impulses

121
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,089 
and if we are talking about a linear
system

122
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:04,330 
the response to that linear combination
is a linear combination of the responses

123
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,370 
so if we denote the response

124
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,990 
to with the late in paul's as H+ the
cave and

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,010 
then the response to

126
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,740 
this general input is what i've
indicated here

127
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,669 
where why event of course is the output

128
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,890 
due to the general in protective and

129
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,000 
H+ the cave and is the output do

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,169 
to the late in polls and these are
simply

131
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,200 
the coefficients in the waiting

132
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,229 
so for linear system we have

133
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,330 
this representation and

134
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,580 
if now in addition the system is
time-invariant

135
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,080 
we can in fact relate the outputs

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279 
due to these individuals the late in
polls

137
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,360 
specifically if the system is
time-invariant

138
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,540 
then the response to an impulse at the
time

139
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,339 
K is exactly the same as the response to
an impulse at time 0

140
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,050 
shifted over two-time K said another way

141
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,170 
h2k a van it simply

142
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,540 
80 then minus K where 80

143
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,140 
is the response to the system to an
impulse at an equal 0

144
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,590 
and it's generally useful to

145
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,710 
rather than carrying around 80 a band

146
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,800 
just simply define 80 then

147
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,120 
as a chip and which is

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,060 
the unit sample or unit impulse response
to the system

149
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,090 
and so the consequent then is for

150
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,340 
a linear time-invariant system

151
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,820 
the output can be expressed as this

152
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,530 
some where a true then minus K

153
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,590 
is the response to an impulse occurring
at time n equals K

154
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,770 
and this is referred to

155
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,780 
as the convolution saw

156
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,720 
now we can just to emphasize

157
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,720 
how we've going about this let me show
it from another perspective

158
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,980 
we of course have taken the sequence X
the van

159
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,080 
we have decomposed that as

160
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,950 
a linear combination out these waited
the late impulses

161
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,170 
when these are added together those
correspond

162
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,810 
to the original sequence active and

163
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,290 
if this in polls for example

164
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,410 
generates a response

165
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,020 
which is exit 0 times a chip and we're a
tremendous the response

166
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,680 
to unit in polls at an equal 0

167
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,590 
and the second one the late generates
the delayed

168
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,690 
waited response and the third one
similarly

169
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,000 
and we generate these individual
responses

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,120 
these are all added together and it that
linear combination

171
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,180 
that forms the final output

172
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,150 
so that's really kind of the way we're
thinking about it we have a general

173
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,510 
sequence

174
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,170 
we're thinking love each individual
sample

175
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,240 
individually each one of those pops the
system

176
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,620 
and because the linearity the response
is the sum

177
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,660 
for those individual responses

178
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,220 
well thats what happens in discrete-time
and

179
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,060 
pretty much the same strategy works in
continuous-time

180
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,310 
a particular

181
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,870 
we can begin in continuous-time

182
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,010 
with the notion 0 decomposing

183
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,570 
a continuous-time signal into

184
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,030 
succession love are bitterly narrow
rectangles

185
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,630 
and as these rectangles is the with the
rectangles goes

186
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,080 
0 the approximation gets better and

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,210 
essentially what's going to happen is
that you to those individual rectangles

188
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,350 
as they get narrower and narrower
correspond more and more

189
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,970 
to an impulse well let me show you what
I mean

190
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,960 
here we have a continue with time signal

191
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,040 
and I've approximated it

192
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,550 
by staircase

193
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,680 
so in Athens I can't think of this

194
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,960 
as individual rectangles

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,750 
a fight associated with the height the
continuous curve

196
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,460 
and so i've indicated that down below
here for example

197
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,980 
is the impulse corresponding to the
rectangle between

198
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,110 
people's -2 dealt in people's minds
felker

199
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,370 
here's the one from minus felt that 20

200
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,190 
and as we continue on down we get

201
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,800 
impulses or rather rectangles from
success the park to the way for

202
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,300 
now let's look specifically at the

203
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,720 
rectangle for example starting at zero
and ending at Delta

204
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,220 
and the amplitude of it is exit Delta

205
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,310 
and so

206
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,570 
what we have actually this should be
exit 0

207
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,970 
and so not be just correct that

208
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,160 
here that sex is zero and so

209
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,029 
we have a rectangle a fight exit 0

210
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,140 
and recall the function that I defined
last time

211
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,360 
as dealt this the capital Delta p

212
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,120 
which had height1 over Delta and with
dealt

213
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,110 
so multiply finally by this last little
Delta

214
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,410 
then this is a representation for

215
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,529 
the rectangle that i've shown there now

216
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,320 
there's a little bit about you were
there too kinda track through

217
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,630 
but what we're really doing is just
simply representing this

218
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,820 
in terms the rectangles what I want to
do is describing each rectangle

219
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,410 
as in terms that function dealt with the
bell 30

220
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,500 
which in the limit then becomes an
impulse well so extract that

221
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,779 
through a little further

222
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:28,800 
when we have that linear combination

223
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,670 
then were saying that x50 can be
represented

224
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,130 
by Osama's I indicate here

225
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,310 
which I can then

226
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:46,310 
right more generally in this form just
indicating that this is an infinite sum

227
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,760 
we now want to take the limit as Delta
goes to zero

228
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,470 
and his daughter goes to zero notice

229
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,400 
that this term becomes are bitterly
narrow

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,790 
this goes to our impulse function and
this of course

231
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,360 
goes to exit Towne and in fact

232
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,440 
in the limit some out this form

233
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279 
is exactly the way an integral is the
point

234
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,580 
so we have an expression for wire T

235
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,370 
in terms of an impulse function their I
have to admit

236
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,550 
is a little bit have detailed the kinda
focus on

237
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,290 
at your leisure but this is the general
load the strategy

238
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,830 
so what we have now is and integral

239
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,650 
tell that tells us how except he can be
described

240
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,720 
as a thong or linear combination

241
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,089 
involving in polls

242
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:48,150 
this bottom equation by the way is often
referred to as the sifting integral

243
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,160 
in essence what it says is that if I
take a time function exit tea and put it

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,720 
through that integral

245
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,970 
the impulse as did dipped by

246
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,029 
generates X-eighty all over again

247
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,060 
now at first glance what it could look
like

248
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,339 
is that we've taken a time function X 50

249
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,450 
and proceeded to represented in a very
complicated way

250
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,730 
interns have itself and one could ask
her why bother doing that

251
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,730 
and the reason going back to what r

252
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,070 
strategy was is that

253
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,690 
what we want to do is exploit

254
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,040 
the property lovely area so

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,000 
by describing a time function

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,910 
as a linear combination have waited too
late impulses

257
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,310 
as in effect we've done through

258
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:47,190 
this some Asian that corresponds to a
decomposition in terms of impulses

259
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,000 
we can now exploit linearity

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,250 
specifically recognizing that the output

261
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,980 
have a linear system is this some

262
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,149 
or the responses to these individual
inputs

263
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,380 
so with h2k

264
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,799 
Delta I love see corresponding to the
response

265
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,959 
to built this adult the T-minus k Delta

266
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,240 
and arrested this stop the exit k Delta
and there's little doubt the

267
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,520 
are basically scale factors for a linear
system

268
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,600 
then if the input is expressed in this
form

269
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,799 
the output is expressed in this form

270
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,909 
again taking the limit is Delta goes to
zero

271
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:35,429 
by definition this corresponds to an
integral

272
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,870 
and it the integral that we indicated
that I indicate here

273
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,399 
with H+ the tower T corresponding to

274
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,490 
the impulse response

275
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,590 
due to an impulse occurring at

276
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,730 
time town now again we can do

277
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,990 
the same thing a in particular

278
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,429 
if the system is time-invariant then the
response to each of these the late

279
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,110 
impulses

280
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,980 
is simply at the late version up the
impulse response

281
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,160 
and so we can relate these individual
terms

282
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,170 
and in particular than the response to
an impulse occurring at time t cloth

283
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,480 
towel

284
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,020 
it's simply the response to an impulse
occurring at time 0

285
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,570 
shifted over to the time origin town

286
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,610 
and again as we did before but dropped
the subscript 80

287
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,860 
so 80 love the

288
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,400 
will simply defined as a trip to the

289
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,750 
and what we're left with when we do that

290
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,390 
is the description over linear
time-invariant system

291
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,880 
through this integral which tells us

292
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,120 
how the output is related to

293
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,990 
the input and two the impulse response

294
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,390 
again let's just quickly look at this

295
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,840 
from another perspective as we did in
discrete-time

296
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,080 
recall that what we've done is to take
the

297
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,240 
continuous function decomposed it in
terms

298
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,340 
%uh rectangles and then

299
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,490 
each of these rectangles generates

300
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,000 
its individual response

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,020 
and then these individual responses are
added together

302
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,150 
and as we go through that process

303
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,230 
the chorus there's a process whereby

304
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,670 
we let the approximation go to the

305
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,910 
to the representation over smooth talker

306
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,880 
now again I stress that their is
certainly

307
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,760 
paramount to kinda examined carefully
there

308
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,250 
but it's important to also reflect on
what we've done which

309
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,120 
is really pretty significant well we've
managed to accomplish

310
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,750 
is to exploit the properties linear
ready in time invariance

311
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,270 
so that the system could be represented

312
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,850 
interns only over its response to

313
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,150 
and in polls at time 0 so for a linear
time-invariant system quite amazingly

314
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,030 
actually

315
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,380 
if you know its response to an impulse
at equal 0 or 10 equal 0 depending on

316
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,400 
discrete or continuous time then in fact

317
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,020 
through the convolution some in
discrete-time or the convolution

318
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,760 
integral in continuous-time

319
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,130 
you can generate the response to an
arbitrary input

320
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,820 
let me just introduced a small amount
have

321
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,690 
notation again reminding you

322
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,429 
all her the convolution some in the
discrete-time case

323
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:51,720 
which looks as i've indicated here this
summer

324
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,980 
exit Khon minus K

325
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,910 
will have the requirement to making such
frequent reference

326
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,140 
to convolution dead it can be any and

327
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,120 
to notation we represented as I have
here with an asterisk

328
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,340 
and so X a van with the asterisk

329
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,520 
a trip and means r denotes the
convolution affects a van with a chip

330
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,670 
and

331
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,240 
and correspondingly in the
continuous-time case

332
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,980 
we have the convolution integral in
which

333
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,230 
here is the third thing in to grow as we
talked about representing exit the

334
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,630 
interns or itself hour as a linear
combination of the late impulses

335
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,040 
and here we have the convolution
integral and again

336
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,970 
will use the asterisk to denote
convolution

337
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,370 
now there's a lot about convolution

338
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,190 
that we want to talk about it their
properties of convolution which tell us

339
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,120 
about properties

340
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,410 
linear time-invariant systems also

341
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,520 
it's important to focus on the mechanics

342
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,049 
or implementing accomplish in in other
words understanding and generating some

343
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,809 
fluency and insight

344
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,660 
into what these particulars

345
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,130 
some an integral expressions me

346
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,600 
so let's first look at discrete-time
convolution

347
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,200 
and examine more specifically what in
essence

348
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,010 
some tells us to do in terms of
manipulating the sequences

349
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,299 
so and returning to the

350
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,510 
expression for the

351
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,809 
convolutions Tom as I show here

352
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,620 
some love exit K a true then minus

353
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,770 
K let's focused in on an example

354
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,770 
where we choose active and as a unit

355
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,960 
step and a chip and as Arial exponential

356
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,090 
times the unit step so with the quick
fix a van

357
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,559 
is as they indicate here

358
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,500 
sequence a true fan is an exponential
for positive time in zero for negative

359
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,830 
time so we have active and in a tube and

360
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,460 
but now let's look back at the equation
and

361
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,929 
let me stress that what we want is not

362
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,340 
excessive and nature then we want exit K

363
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,660 
because we're going to some over K and
not a trip K

364
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,980 
but a chip and minus K

365
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,640 
so we have then from

366
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,700 
expand its straightforward to generate
exit K at that

367
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,570 
simply changing the index it's a nation

368
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,500 
and what's a true then minus K well what
they two-minus K

369
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,150 
H A minus K is huka flipped over

370
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,850 
so hip this is white

371
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,150 
8 UK looks like than

372
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,809 
this is what a2 n my SK looks like

373
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,700 
and in essence why it the operation of
convolution

374
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,700 
or the mechanics of convolution tells us
to do

375
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,860 
is to take the sequence HO

376
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:19,049 
and minus K which is a check minus k
position with its origin and cake balls

377
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:20,340 
and

378
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,090 
and multiply this sequence by this
sequence

379
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,780 
and some the product from K equals minus
infinity plus infinity

380
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,059 
so if we were to compute for example

381
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:38,100 
the output at an equal 0

382
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,620 
as I positioned this sequence here this
is that an equal 0

383
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,030 
I would take this and multiply it by
this and some

384
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,640 
from minus infinity plus infinity or

385
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,520 
for an equal one I would position it
here frank with two outs with position

386
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,450 
it here at center

387
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,450 
well you can kinda see what the idea is

388
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,650 
let's look at this a little more
dynamically and see it

389
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,780 
in fact how one sequence fly past the
other

390
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,750 
and how the output why I have an build
up to

391
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,960 
the correct answer

392
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,090 
so the input they were considering is a
step input

393
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:23,740 
which I show here and the impulse
response that we welcome all this with

394
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,250 
is a decaying exponential now

395
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,309 
to form the convolution we want the
product %uh exit K

396
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:34,890 
not with a chip K but with a chip and
minus K

397
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,890 
corresponding to taking a chief K and

398
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,850 
reflecting at about the origin and then
shifting it appropriately

399
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,230 
so here we see HR then minus K for an
equal to 0

400
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,400 
namely H minus K and now a true

401
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,520 
one minus K which will show next is this

402
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,669 
shifted to the right by one point

403
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,700 
here we have a 2-1 minus K

404
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,419 
shifting to the right by one more point
is a trip to minus K

405
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:12,740 
shifting again to the right will have
ages 3 minus K

406
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,700 
and now let's shift back to the left

407
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,380 
until and is negative and

408
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,460 
then will begin the convolution so
here's an equal 0

409
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,250 
any cause -1 any cause -2

410
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,590 
and and it was minus-3 now to form the
convolution we want the product

411
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,610 
exit k with a true then minus K song
from

412
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,890 
minus infinity plus infinity and

413
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,140 
for and negative that product is zero
and therefore the result the convolution

414
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,440 
is zero

415
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,020 
as we shift to the right will build up
the convolution

416
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,070 
and the result the convolution will be
shown on the bottom trace

417
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,100 
so we begin the process

418
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,679 
with and negative and here we have any
calls -1

419
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,190 
at n equals 0 we get our first 90
contribution

420
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:14,799 
now as we ship further to the right
corresponding to increasing N

421
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,020 
we will accumulate more and more

422
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,360 
turns in the psalm and the convolution

423
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,020 
will build up in particular for this
example

424
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,950 
the result to the convolution increases
monotonically

425
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,860 
asymptotically approaching a constant
and that constant in fact

426
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,090 
is just simply the accumulation love

427
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:44,090 
the values under the exponential

428
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,169 
now let's carry out the convolution this
time with an input which is a

429
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,600 
rectangular pulses that have a step
input

430
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,429 
again the same impulse response namely
the King exponential

431
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,640 
and so we want to begin with HR then
minus K

432
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,049 
again with and negative shown here and
again with any negative

433
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,460 
there are no 90 turns in the product

434
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,539 
and so the convolution for and negative
will be zero as it was in the previous

435
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:17,080 
case

436
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,789 
again on the bottom trace will show the
result of the convolution as the impulse

437
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:23,520 
response

438
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,380 
slides along at any cost 0 we get our
first 90 term

439
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,909 
and as in increases passed

440
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,490 
0 we will begin to generate an output

441
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,360 
basically the same as the output that we
generated with a step input

442
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,620 
until the impulse response

443
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,950 
reaches a point where as we slide
further

444
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,289 
we slide outside the interval where the
rectangle is non-zero

445
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,330 
so when we slide one point further from
what shown here

446
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,940 
the output will now DK

447
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,450 
corresponding to the fact dead the

448
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,740 
impulse responses sliding outside

449
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,419 
the interval in which the input is
non-zero

450
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:19,419 
and so on the bottom trace we now see
the result that the convolution

451
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,030 
okay so what

452
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,150 
you've seen then is an example

453
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,990 
love discrete-time convolution let's now

454
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,520 
look at an example love continuous-time
convolution

455
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,220 
and as you might expect continuous-time
convolution operates in

456
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,850 
exactly the same way continuous-time
convolution

457
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,060 
we have be expression again

458
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,230 
y'at is an integral with

459
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,000 
now except now NHL t minus

460
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,140 
now it had exactly the same kinda
perform

461
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,210 
as we had previously for

462
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,610 
discrete-time convolution and and in
fact the mechanics

463
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,690 
0 the continuous-time convolution are
identical

464
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,320 
so here Misar example with X 50 equal to
unity

465
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,320 
step and 850 now a real exponential time
two units that I show

466
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,350 
here x50 which is the unit step function

467
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,900 
here we have a gypsy

468
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,630 
which is an exponential for positive
time

469
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,690 
and 0 for negative time now

470
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,000 
again looking back at the expression

471
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,210 
work on pollution it's not accept either
we want

472
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,570 
its except now that we want and it's not

473
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,180 
H all tea or a chip how that we want it
850

474
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,710 
minus now we plan to multiply these
together

475
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,230 
and integrate over the variable town

476
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,080 
and that gives us the output at any
given time

477
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,580 
if we wanted at another time we change
the value

478
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,880 
the as an argument inside this integral

479
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,510 
so here we have exit T

480
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,460 
here we have a trip to you which isn't
quite what we wanted

481
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,810 
here we have except now and that's fine
its just

482
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,100 
X-eighty with T relabel this panel and
now

483
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,800 
what is 850 minus can now

484
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,040 
well here's a chip panel

485
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,310 
and if we simply turn that over

486
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,080 
here is 850 -10 and a trip T-minus now

487
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,460 
is position then at now

488
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,430 
equal to P and as we change the value to
the

489
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:01,130 
to change the position this signal and
now we multiply

490
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,090 
these two together and integrate from
minus infinity Department Kennedy

491
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,430 
whip 850 minus now positioned at the
appropriate value with T

492
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,440 
well

493
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,390 
again its best really to see this
example and get the notion

494
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,640 
love seek signal being flipped and the
to think not flying past each other

495
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,920 
multiplying in integrating by

496
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,260 
looking at it dynamically and observing
how the answer build-up

497
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,470 
again the input that

498
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,190 
we consider is a step input and again we
use an impulse response

499
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,290 
which is a decaying exponential and

500
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,290 
to form the convolution we want the
product

501
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,460 
love accept an hour not with a chipped
out but with a chip T-minus

502
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,630 
now so we want HFT time reversed

503
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,550 
and then shifted appropriately depending
on the value with T

504
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,510 
let's first just look at age 50 -10 now

505
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,120 
for T positive corresponding to shifting

506
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,540 
a chip -10 now to the right and here we
have

507
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,210 
TV increasing here

508
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,570 
is TV decreasing and we

509
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,280 
we want to begin the convolution with T
negative

510
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,890 
corresponding to shifting H A minus
towel

511
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,030 
to the left now to form the convolution
we want the product if these two

512
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,980 
and pretty negative there are no 90

513
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,600 
contributions to the integral

514
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,440 
and so the convolution will be 0 party
less than zero

515
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,090 
and the bottom trace we show the results
of the convolution

516
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,470 
here for T negative

517
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:58,470 
and pretty less than zero we will
continue to have zero in the convolution

518
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,850 
now as TV increases past

519
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,920 
0 we begin to get some 90 contribution

520
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,030 
in the product indicated by the fact
that the convolution

521
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,780 
the result to the convolution starts to
build-up

522
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,730 
and as see increases further

523
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,370 
we will get more and more 90
contribution

524
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,420 
in the in a grand and so

525
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,760 
the resulted the convolution will be

526
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,530 
a monotonically increasing function for
this particular example

527
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,880 
which asymptotically approaches a
constant

528
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,890 
and that constant will be proportional

529
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,300 
to the area under the impulse response
because that the fact that work

530
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,180 
involving

531
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:51,180 
with the step input

532
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,839 
now let's carry out the convolution with
an input which is

533
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,810 
a rectangular Paul's again an impulse
response which is an exponential

534
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,970 
and so to form the convolution we want
except now with a2

535
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,099 
T-minus towel H A T minus now shown here
for TE

536
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,800 
negative and again to form the
convolution we take

537
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,349 
the integral all the product if these
two

538
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,710 
which again will be 0 for

539
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,099 
T less than zero so the bottom trace
shows the result of the convolution

540
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,380 
here shown is zero and it will continue
to be 0

541
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,010 
until T becomes positive at which point
we build up

542
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,910 
some 90 turn

543
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,930 
in the in a grant now as we slide
further

544
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,050 
until the impulse response

545
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,680 
shifts outside the interval in which the
polls

546
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,520 
is 90 the output will build up

547
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,569 
but here we've now begun to leave that
interval

548
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:08,430 
and so the output will start to BK
exponentially

549
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,700 
and as the impulse response

550
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,000 
slides further and further corresponding
to

551
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,099 
increasing see then the output

552
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:23,190 
will DK exponentially representing the
fact

553
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,640 
that their is less and less area

554
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,470 
in the product love except now

555
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,109 
and a chief T-minus now and
asymptotically

556
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:41,619 
this output will then approach 0 okay so

557
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:46,829 
you've seen convolution a you see the
derivation of convolution and kinda the

558
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,859 
graphical

559
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,640 
representation convolution finally

560
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,630 
let's work again with these two examples

561
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,440 
and let's go through those two examples
analytically

562
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,170 
so that we finally see how analytically

563
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,079 
the result develops for those same
examples

564
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,089 
well we have

565
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:15,490 
first the discrete-time case and let's
take our discrete-time example

566
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,839 
and and in general the convolution some

567
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,910 
is as I indicated here so yes

568
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,569 
is just our expression from before which
is

569
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:32,990 
the convolution some and if we take our
two examples

570
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,540 
the example love and it put which is

571
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,589 
unit step and an impulse response

572
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:45,200 
which is a real exponential multiplied
by a unit step

573
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,310 
we have then

574
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,750 
replacing exit K by

575
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,980 
what we know the input to be an HR then
minus K

576
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,770 
by what we know the impulse response to
be the output is

577
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,660 
the expression that we have here now

578
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,970 
in this expression and you'll see this

579
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,150 
of very generally and with the more
complicated examples

580
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,869 
when you look at the tax as

581
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:21,160 
you go to evaluate these expressions

582
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,190 
generally what happens is that the
signals have different analytical

583
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,280 
forms in different regions and that's a
fact

584
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,339 
what we have here your particular let's

585
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:37,890 
look at the thumb and well we observed
first the ball

586
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,980 
is that the

587
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,050 
limits on this song are going to be
modified

588
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,819 
depending on where this unit step

589
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:51,710 
is zero and non-zero in particular

590
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,030 
if we first consider what will turn out
to be the simple case

591
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,730 
namely and less than zero for and less
than zero

592
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,829 
this unit step is

593
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:08,800 
0 for K

594
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,430 
greater than an and with an less than
zero

595
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,310 
that means that this unit step never

596
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,720 
is 90 for K

597
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,900 
positive on the other hand

598
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,040 
this unit step is never 90

599
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,400 
or is always 0 for k negative

600
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,619 
let me just stressed that by looking at
the particular grabs

601
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:40,880 
here is the unit step you FK

602
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,080 
here is the units that you then minus K

603
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,349 
and for and less than zero so that this
point comes before this point

604
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,030 
the product these two is equal to 0

605
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,530 
that means there is no overlap between
these two terms

606
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,589 
and so it says that why I have an

607
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:05,960 
the output is 0 for and less than 0

608
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,089 
well that was an easy one a her

609
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:12,830 
bring greater than 0 it's not quite a
straightforward

610
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,339 
as coming out with the answers 0 so now

611
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:21,220 
let's look at what happens when the two
units steps overlap

612
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,089 
and this would correspond to

613
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:30,530 
what i've labeled here as interval to
namely for and greater than 0

614
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,040 
if we just look back at the

615
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,160 
summation that we had the summation now

616
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,060 
corresponds to this unit step

617
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,319 
and this unit step having some overlap

618
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,520 
so for interval to

619
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,530 
corresponding to an greater than 0 we
have

620
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,200 
you have K the unit step

621
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,580 
we have you love and minus K

622
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,240 
which is a unit step going backward in
time

623
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,550 
by which extends

624
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,930 
for positive values have an

625
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,540 
if we think about multiplying these two
together

626
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,810 
we will get in the product unity

627
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,839 
for what values at K well

628
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:29,109 
for K starting at zero corresponding to
one of the units steps

629
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:33,349 
ending at hand corresponding to the
other units that

630
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,970 
so we have an overlap between these

631
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,500 
for k equal to 0 et cetera

632
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,369 
up through the value and

633
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:49,680 
right now that means that in terms of
the original some

634
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,680 
we can get rid of the units steps
involved by simply changing the limits

635
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,190 
on the some

636
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,480 
and the limits now are from zero

637
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,490 
to an the term

638
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,730 
out for to the end minus K

639
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,640 
we had before you with Cain you then
minus K and that disappeared because

640
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,770 
because we don't with that simply by
modifying the limits

641
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,220 
we now pull out the term output to the N

642
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,130 
because the summation is on canine and
so we can

643
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,160 
simply poll that term

644
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,540 
out at the some

645
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,670 
and we now have out but the minus K

646
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,339 
which we can write rewrite as alpha to
the minus 12 PK

647
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:40,160 
and the upshot of all of this is that
why I have an

648
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,040 
now we can really express as output to
the end

649
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,349 
its own from 0 to end up outfit to the
-1

650
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,900 
to the K well question is how do we

651
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,920 
evaluate that and

652
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,349 
it's essentially corresponds to a finite
number

653
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:01,790 
turns in a geometric series and that bio

654
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:07,250 
by the way is estimation that will recur
over and over and over and over again

655
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,930 
and it's one that you should right down
right on your back pocket right in the

656
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,400 
palm of your hand

657
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,060 
or whatever it takes to remember it what
you'll see is that that will recur

658
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,460 
can more or less the throughout the
course

659
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,040 
and so it's one worth remembering and in
particular

660
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,560 
what the storm love a geometric

661
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,010 
series is is what i've indicated here

662
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:38,400 
we have this song from 0 to our they did
to the K

663
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,490 
and it's one minus beta to the are plus
one

664
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,020 
this is one more than the

665
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,700 
upper limit on the summation and in the
denominator is one minus beta

666
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,160 
so this equation is important

667
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,080 
is no point in attempting to derive it
however you get to it it's important

668
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,540 
to retain okay well

669
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,540 
we can now use that some Asian

670
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,630 
in the expression that we just the
ballot

671
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,080 
and so let's proceed to a value a tax on
clothes

672
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,890 
form so we now know go back

673
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,380 
to the expression that we just worked
out

674
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,859 
why event is output to the end its own
from 0 to N

675
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:31,990 
output to the -1 to the K

676
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,339 
this plays the role a beta in a turn
that I just

677
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,339 
in the expression and I just presented

678
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,630 
and so using

679
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:47,040 
bat using that result we can rewrite
this summation as i indicate here

680
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,190 
and the final result that we end up with

681
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,299 
after a certain amount of algebra is

682
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:59,080 
why I have an equal to one minus output
to the end plus one

683
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,089 
divided by one minus out for

684
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:07,650 
and let me just kinda vindicate with a
few dots here

685
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:14,029 
dead there is a certain amount of
algebra required in going from

686
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,150 
this step to this step and

687
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,319 
and I I'd like to leave you with the
phone an opportunity you doing at your

688
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:20,859 
leisure

689
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:25,390 
okay well so so the expression we have
now

690
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,819 
for wired and is why I have an

691
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:33,250 
equal to one myself up to be enforced
one divided by one minus now for

692
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,599 
that bring greater than 0 we found out
previously that it was 0 for and less

693
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,589 
than 0

694
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:43,670 
and finally if we were to plot this what
we would

695
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,250 
get is the graph that I indicate here

696
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:52,130 
the first non-zero value occurs at an
equal 0

697
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,490 
and it has a height 1 and then

698
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,520 
the next 90 value at one and this has a
height

699
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,599 
a one plus alpha and this is one place
now for

700
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,270 
on South squared and and

701
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:12,569 
the sequence continues on like that

702
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,470 
an asymptotically approaches as n goes
to infinity

703
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,359 
asymptotically approaches one over one
minute South for

704
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,240 
which is consistent with the algebraic
expression

705
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,039 
that we have that we develop and
obviously of course

706
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,450 
is also consistent with the movie
alright so that's our

707
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,069 
discrete-time example which we kinda
went through graphically

708
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:41,380 
with the transparencies and we went
through graphically with the movie you

709
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,010 
know we've gone through analytically

710
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,690 
now let's look analytically at

711
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,010 
the continuous-time example which pretty
much

712
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,140 
close in the same way as we've just gone
through

713
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,569 
so again we have

714
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:59,700 
the convolution integral which is

715
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,329 
the integral indicated at the top

716
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:09,470 
and our example you recall was with
accepting as a unit step

717
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,960 
and a trip to the as

718
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,630 
an exponential times the units that so

719
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,920 
when we substitute those then this then
corresponds to

720
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,190 
exit to the and this corresponds to 850
-10 now

721
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,710 
and again we have the same

722
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,789 
issue more last which is that inside
that integral

723
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:38,890 
there are two steps one of them going
forward in time and one of them going

724
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,670 
backward in time and we need to examine

725
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,589 
when they overlap in when they don't
when they don't overlap the product of

726
00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:47,849 
course is zero

727
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,980 
and there's no point doing any
integration because the anagram 20

728
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,150 
so if we track it through we have again

729
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,710 
interval one which is to us$10,000

730
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,410 
pretty less than zero this unit step

731
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,539 
which only begins at: equals 0

732
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,799 
a tally cool 0 and this unit step

733
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:13,119 
which is zero by the time

734
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,940 
how gets up to TN beyond party less than
zero

735
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,170 
is no overlap between

736
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,349 
the unit step going forward in time

737
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:28,420 
and the units that going backward in
time and consequently

738
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,849 
the in a grand is equal to 0 and
consequently

739
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:37,859 
the output is equal to 0 okay

740
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:41,099 
now we can

741
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,230 
likewise looked at the interval where

742
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:50,420 
the to unit steps to overlap and in that
case what happens again is that the

743
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,240 
overlap

744
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,750 
in essence the units that tells us gives
us a range

745
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,549 
on the integration and in particular

746
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:04,410 
the two-step overlap 20 is greater than
0

747
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,950 
from how equal 0

748
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,990 
two towers both T so

749
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,920 
critical to party greater than 0

750
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,490 
again of course we have in this
expression

751
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,559 
this product love this unit step

752
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,960 
and this unit step is equal to 1

753
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,539 
in this rain

754
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:32,900 
and so that allows us then

755
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,289 
to change the limits on the integral

756
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,509 
mister from minus infinity two plus
infinity

757
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:45,650 
we know that the in a grand is non-zero
only over this range

758
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,970 
looking at this in to grow we can now
pull out the term which corresponds to

759
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,609 
you need to the -80 just as we pulled
out

760
00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:58,279 
a term in the discrete-time case

761
00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:01,890 
and we noticed in the integral we have
eat to the

762
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:08,690 
-8 -10 now so that gives us the integral
from 0 to TV to the eight-hour

763
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,710 
and if we perform at integration

764
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,119 
we end up with this expression

765
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,940 
and finally multiplying this by either
the -80

766
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,140 
we have for y'at pretty greater than 0

767
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,660 
the algebraic expression that I

768
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,890 
indicated on the bottom

769
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,089 
so so we had worked out

770
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:38,200 
to less than zero and we come out 10

771
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,740 
we work out take greater than 0 and we
come out

772
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:46,640 
with this algebraic expression

773
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,520 
and if we plot this out to rate
expression as a function of time

774
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,609 
we find that what it corresponds to is

775
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:58,069 
an exponential behavior starting at zero

776
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:02,539 
and exponentially heading asymptotically

777
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:08,779 
forward the bad you one over it

778
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:12,569 
okay now we've gone through these
examples several ways than one is

779
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,520 
analytically

780
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,660 
in order to develop a feel and fluency
for convolution

781
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,029 
it's absolutely essential to work
through a variety of examples

782
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:29,049 
both understanding them graphically and
understanding them as we did hear

783
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:34,109 
analytically and you'll have an
opportunity to do that

784
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:39,029 
through the problems that I suggested in
the video course manual

785
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,789 
in the next lecture what will turn to

786
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:46,119 
are some general properties of
convolution

787
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,529 
and show how this rather amazing
representation

788
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:53,890 
when your time invariant systems in fact
leads to a variety

789
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,549 
%uh properties linear time-invariant
systems

790
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,730 
and will find that convolution its

791
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:04,500 
fairly rich in its properties and what
this leads to

792
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,579 
are some very nice and

793
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:10,859 
desirable and exploitable properties

794
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,990 
linear time-invariant systems thank you
