00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
we see that that is equivalent to

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
a change in phase and important thing to recognize
在第二阶段，并认识到重要的一点变化

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000

represents an appropriate face
代表适量涂于面部

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
so a time shift corresponds to a phase change
这样一个时间移位对应于相变

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and a phase change likewise corresponds to it I'm ship
和一种相变同样对应于它我船

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and so for example if we
因此，例如，如果我们

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
look at the sinusoidal signal
看看正弦信号

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the general sinusoidal signal that we

the following grass
下面的草

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
shifting it appropriately as i've indicated here
它适当地转移，因为我已经在这里表示

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
this of course still has the property that it's a periodic function
这当然还是有，这是一个周期函数的性质

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
since we simply displaced in time
因为我们只是在时间上移位

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and by looking at the graph what we see is that it has another very important
并且通过观察该图我们看到的是，它有另外一个非常重要

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
property
属性

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
if when we reflected about the origin it looks exactly the same so it's a metric
如果当我们反映关于原点它看起来完全一样的，所以它是一个度量

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
about the origin and looking at
关于起源和看

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
this sinusoid that in fact has that property
此正弦波，其实有一个属性

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and mathematically this statement that it's even is equivalent to the statement
和数学这条语句，它甚至相当于声明

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that if we replace the time argument
如果我们更换时间参数

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
by its negative the function itself

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
doesn't change
不改变

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
now this corresponded to a phase shift 0 in our original

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
cosine expression if instead we had
余弦表达式，如果不是我们有

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
chosen a phase shift love let's say minus pie over to

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then is that a a cosigner so it'll signal

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
well we would generate is a sinusoid
好，我们会产生一个正弦

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with the appropriate phase or

substitute in for the phase minus pie over to

using just straight for trigonometric identities
只使用直三角恒等式

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
we can express that alternately as signed Omega 0t

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
are very much like continuous-time ones but also
非常像连续时间的，但也

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
with some very important differences and we want to focus not only on the
有一些非常重要的区别，我们希望不仅着眼于

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
similarities
相似之处

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but also on the differences well let's begin
同时也对差异以及让我们开始吧

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with the mathematical expression a
用数学表达式

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
discrete-time sinusoidal signal mathematically
离散时间正弦信号在数学上

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is as i've indicated here a cosine
是因为我在这里表示一个余弦

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Omega 0 and plus the and just says
欧米茄0加，只是说：

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in the continuous-time case the parameter
在连续时间的情况下的参数

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a is what we refer to as the airport to
一个就是我们所说的机场

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Omega 0 as the frequency and see
ω-0的频率和看

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
as the face
作为脸

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I've illustrated
我已经说明

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
here several discrete-time
这里几个离散时间

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
sinusoidal signals and they kinda
正弦信号，他们还挺

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
look similar in fact if you sort of track what you might think of is the
看起来其实相类似的，如果你跟踪你可能会想到的是什么

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
envelope
信封

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
it looks very much like what a continuous-time sign outside so it might
它看起来非常像一个连续时间签署外，这样它可能

00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
look like
像

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but keep in mind day at the independent variable in this case
但要记住每天在这种情况下，自变量

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
isn't integer variable and so
是不是整型变量等

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the sequence in fact only takes on bag use
其实序列只对包的使用

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
at integer values up the argument and we'll see
在整数值起来的说法，我们会看到

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that that has a a very important
即，有一个很重要的

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
implication and will see that shortly now
言下之意，并会看到，现在很快

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
one of the issues that we addressed in the continuous-time cases periodicity
那我们在连续时间情况下，周期性解决的问题之一

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and I want to refer or return to that
我想引用或返回到

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
shortly because that is in fact one of the areas where there is an important
不久，因为这是事实的地方有一个重要的
