1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,720 
ha the

2
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,380 
the norm

3
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,380 
are

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,910 
last time

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,770 
we began the discussion I'll
discrete-time processing

6
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,280 
love continuous-time signals and

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,420 
as a reminder let me review

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,670 
the basic notion the idea was

9
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:60,860 
dead we convert

10
00:00:60,860 --> 00:01:05,100 
from a continuous-time signal to a
sequence

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,229 
through an operation which I

12
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:12,300 
represent as a continuous to
discrete-time converter

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,259 
and then that sequence

14
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,770 
is used as the input to

15
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,290 
inappropriate discrete-time system

16
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,630 
and after appropriate discrete-time
processing

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,750 
that sequence is converted

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,640 
back to a continuous-time signal

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,970 
through an operation which i-label as

20
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,409 
a discrete to continuous-time converter

21
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,799 
now in the lecture

22
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,390 
last time we carried out some analysis

23
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,110 
which related 4s the spectra

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,880 
in the first step this operation namely

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,490 
in the transformation from a
continuous-time

26
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,020 
signal to sequence and

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,060 
let me by the way draw your attention to
the fact

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,429 
that in the real world this operation

29
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,830 
is essentially implemented

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,890 
by what you would typically label as an
analog to digital converter

31
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,320 
if in fact the discrete-time processing

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,220 
is being done digitally now it's
important to emphasize that it's not

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,989 
exactly what an analog to digital
converter

34
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,180 
does but in some sense at least you
should think

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,260 
love this mapping from continuous time
to discrete-time

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,660 
in very much the same way there one
would think an analog to digital

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,640 
converter

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,000 
and the mapping back and is corresponds

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,700 
in some sense to a what would happen

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,700 
with a digital to analog converter well

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,450 
let me review what is involved in the
mapping from

42
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,160 
the continuous-time signal to the
sequence and

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,260 
let me stress again that this operation

44
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,170 
is basically in the continues to
discrete-time conversion

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,739 
a two-step process in

46
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,819 
the first part of the process the
continuous-time signal

47
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,319 
is modulated with an impulse train

48
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,520 
where the period of the imposed strain
is capital T

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,739 
and so we have a continuous-time

50
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,010 
impose Train Signal which captures

51
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,849 
the samples love the original
continuous-time signals

52
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,489 
that in Paul strain

53
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,650 
is then put through an operation

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,700 
which essentially re labels

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,129 
the samples so that the

56
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,260 
sample values the impulse areas

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,220 
are relabeled as sequence values

58
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,860 
and the result of that conversion is
then

59
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,970 
the sequence X event so the overall
process then

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,180 
is a sampling process followed by

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,420 
what is simply in this box relabeling

62
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,830 
process and although as I

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,479 
indicated just a minute ago that is
essentially what an analog to digital

64
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:20,950 
converter does

65
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,240 
now like to digital converter doesn't
necessarily carry it out

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,610 
in those two steps but particularly

67
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,960 
in terms love carrying through an
analysis

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,470 
thinking of it as a two-step process is
particularly convenient

69
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,229 
now we talked last time

70
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,430 
about what this mapping from continuous
time to discrete-time

71
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,240 
means both in the time domain in terms
of the spectra

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,650 
and in particular in the time domain we

73
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,960 
begin with the continuous-time signal

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000 
which is then samples with an impulse
train

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,539 
and converted to a sequence by

76
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:07,240 
simply generating a sequence whose
values

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,520 
are the area is love the impulses

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,419 
and I stress the fact that what this
corresponds to

79
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,729 
essentially is and normalization of the
time axis

80
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,979 
essentially by dividing the time axis by
capital T

81
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,000 
in the frequency-domain then

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,390 
we had the spectrum of the original
signal

83
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,080 
which because that the sampling process
is

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,289 
replicated at multiples integer
multiples

85
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,460 
all the sampling frequency Omega so
badass

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,649 
or to pile over capital T

87
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:49,490 
and then in converting the impulses

88
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,099 
to a sequence we are essentially

89
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,080 
normalizing the frequency axis so that

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,000 
the frequency to pile over capital T
gets relabeled is to pie

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,599 
and the resulting discrete-time spectrum
looks like

92
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,870 
I indicate here which really is

93
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,330 
nothing more and a frequency scaling

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,580 
corresponding to the Associated time
scaling so the mapping

95
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,930 
from the imposed strain spectrum to the
discrete-time spectrum

96
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,419 
corresponds to mapping specified

97
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,839 
by capital Omega equal to small make a
times capital T

98
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,440 
an equivalent Lee it's the frequency

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,719 
to pile over capital T which is

100
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:41,190 
of course the sampling frequency which
gets normalized

101
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,760 
to the frequency to pie

102
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,930 
and so in the frequency domain

103
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,669 
their is a frequency normalization
Associated

104
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,700 
with the fact dead corresponding to this
spectrum

105
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,370 
is a time sequence or discrete time
sequence

106
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,919 
as I show previously and a discrete-time
sequence

107
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,380 
is related to the

108
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,520 
original continuous-time signal

109
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,010 
through a time normalization in other
words

110
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,750 
these sequence values are simply samples
at the continuous-time signal

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,110 
with the time axis we normalized

112
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,060 
now what we want to consider this is the
conversion from continuous time to

113
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,300 
discrete-time

114
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,130 
what we want to consider now is the
overall system

115
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,810 
which implements not just the conversion
but filtering

116
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,649 
and then coming back onto the conversion
back to continuous-time

117
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,430 
so let's look at the overall system

118
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,120 
and the overall system courses I've

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,849 
stressed several times in the past
consists

120
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:04,409 
love first the sampling process

121
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,190 
conversion to an impulse train

122
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,560 
and the imposed strain converted to a
sequence

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,080 
that sequence is then processed

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,209 
through are discrete-time filter

125
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,080 
and after the discrete-time processing

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560 
the result of that is converted back

127
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,020 
to an impulse train so this resulting
process sequence

128
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,020 
is then converted back to an impulse
train

129
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,849 
and then finally we carry out the the
sampling

130
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,980 
process by simply using a low-pass
filter

131
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,620 
Associated with the with the cutoff
associated with the sampling frequency

132
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,170 
that we use

133
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,640 
now typically in a system like that
which implements

134
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,890 
discrete-time processing continuous-time
signals

135
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,250 
we either we need to ensure in one way
or another

136
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,459 
that the band with love the input is

137
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,019 
sufficiently limited so that we avoid
aliasing

138
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,329 
one way to do that is to force it in one
way or another or

139
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,199 
simply know that our signal satisfies
the band with constrain

140
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,680 
although a fairly typical thing to do in
addition

141
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,910 
to this sampling process is

142
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,550 
to include what is referred to as

143
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,529 
and anti aliasing filter in other words
this is a filter

144
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,899 
that would ban limit the input

145
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,009 
and at least half the sampling frequency

146
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,190 
so that we r guaranteed and

147
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,620 
that their is no aliasing it's carried
out

148
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,149 
in this process and it's important

149
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,990 
to stress dead in this kinda processing
discrete-time processing

150
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,170 
continuous-time signals except in
certain

151
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,399 
special situations its very important

152
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,649 
to avoid aliasing because we're going to
want

153
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:13,269 
to do a reconstruction after we do the
sampling and processing

154
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,069 
okay now this is the sequence of steps
in the time domain

155
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:20,459 
let's examine what happens as a
consequence is this

156
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,310 
in the frequency domain well

157
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,540 
let's choose some typeof simple
representative spectrum

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,790 
and of course what's important about it
is that

159
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,180 
the specter that we choose is banned
limited or that there's an anti-aliasing

160
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,490 
filter

161
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,110 
and it's not the shape of course that is
critical

162
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,220 
and as we work our way through the
system

163
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,480 
this is the continuous-time spectrum

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,420 
after sampling that spectrum is
replicated at

165
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,360 
multiples of the sampling frequency
integer multiples the sampling frequency

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,689 
and so

167
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:01,370 
there would be another one over here and
another one over here at cetera

168
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,970 
and then in converting to a
discrete-time sequence

169
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,000 
their is The Associated

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,329 
frequency normalization so that the
sampling frequency

171
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,389 
yes normalized to a frequency

172
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:20,410 
to pie okay now at that point

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,709 
where we are in the system

174
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,870 
is at this point

175
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,560 
so that we've converted to a sequence we
now

176
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,560 
want to carry out some filtering and
then after that filtering

177
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,079 
convert back to a continuous-time
signals

178
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,160 
alright so here we are at the

179
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,829 
spectrum Associated with the

180
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,839 
sequence and now

181
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,069 
the processing they were carrying out is

182
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,410 
linear time-invariant filtering in the
discrete time domain

183
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,329 
and what that corresponds to then is
multiplying

184
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:06,470 
this spectrum by the filter frequency
response and I've chosen

185
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,430 
a particular shape and again it's not
the shape that's important to the

186
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,829 
discussion

187
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:16,149 
but the fact for example that it has a
particular cutoff frequency which will

188
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,439 
kinda track

189
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:21,240 
as we work through this and so now

190
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,430 
the spectrum of why I have an the output

191
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,399 
the digital filter is the product this
spectrum

192
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560 
and the 4e a transformer frequency
response

193
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,329 
I'll the digital filter

194
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:41,319 
now in working our way through we're
going to take the output at the filter

195
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:46,100 
and undo the two-step process so we now
want to take that sequence

196
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,439 
converted to an impulse train and then
take then imposed strain

197
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:53,499 
Andy sample through a low-pass filter

198
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:59,240 
so here we are now at the output to the
digital filter

199
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,999 
we then convert that to an impulse train
well that's really on doing the original

200
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,749 
time normalization

201
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:08,939 
and so what that means is that we

202
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:13,430 
are on doing the frequency normalization
in particular

203
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,850 
we're dividing the frequency axis by

204
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,149 
capital T whereas this point

205
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,499 
in y Omega was to pie

206
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,600 
now it's to pile over capital T

207
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,810 
what that means is that acquittal and
Lee were multiplying this spectrum

208
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,860 
by the frequency response the digital
filter

209
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,870 
but now linearly scaled in frequency

210
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,480 
so that will what was a cutoff frequency
Omega subsea

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,769 
is now a cutoff frequency up Omega
subsea

212
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,620 
divided by capital T so

213
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,779 
now the next step in the process is the
reconstructing

214
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,300 
low-pass filter and what that extracts
is simply the portion

215
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,050 
I'll this periodic spectrum around the
origin

216
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,279 
and so finally and spectrum of the
output

217
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,160 
up the overall system will be the
spectrum

218
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360 
of the input multiplied

219
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,110 
by a frequency response

220
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,939 
which is the digital filter frequency
response

221
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,069 
frequency scaled by dividing

222
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:30,720 
that digital filter frequency axis by
capital T

223
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,019 
okay now what we can ask is

224
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,379 
we've got this processing we've
converted to discrete-time we've gone

225
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,079 
back to continuous-time

226
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,589 
and one can ask now what acquittal and

227
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,970 
overall continuous-time systems is that
correspond to

228
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,209 
in other words if we that of course is a
continuous-time system it's a continuous

229
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,819 
time you put a continuous-time output

230
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:57,610 
and the overall system dan

231
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,379 
would be one that would give us exactly
the same output spectrum

232
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,040 
as we're getting well what is that well
we have

233
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,499 
is an output spectrum which is the
product

234
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:14,110 
all the input spectrum and digital
filter frequency characteristic

235
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,040 
frequency scale and so in fact

236
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,459 
the resulting digital filter I'm sorry
continuous-time

237
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,069 
filter is simply the digital filter

238
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:29,160 
with inappropriate frequency scaling

239
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,410 
in other words with the frequency axis
divided by capital T

240
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,800 
so sent another way if

241
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,769 
we show here

242
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,160 
the frequency response or the

243
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,420 
original digital filter

244
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,220 
then the corresponding continuous-time

245
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,749 
filter would be this

246
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,970 
frequency scaled and then because love

247
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,540 
The Associated low-pass filtering in the
reconstruction

248
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,860 
we would select out just one of these
periods in particular the portion around

249
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,089 
the origin

250
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,529 
and the essential consequences that is
that the corresponding

251
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,600 
continuous-time filter then is

252
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,160 
given by this and these two are related

253
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,869 
simply by a linear scaling the frequency
axis

254
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:29,579 
and note dead where the digital filter
has a cutoff frequency

255
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,899 
Omega subsea the continuous-time filter

256
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,589 
has a cutoff frequency Omega subsea
divided by capital T

257
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,610 
so that's the linear frequency scaling
and

258
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,939 
by the way plant away for now and will
return to this point later

259
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,980 
plant the way for now the the
observation

260
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,699 
dad even if the digital filter frequency
response

261
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:57,040 
is fixed which we would assume it is

262
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,399 
by changing the sampling frequency in
fact

263
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,189 
what we're able to do is a fact a linear
scaling

264
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:09,160 
or the acquittal in continuous-time

265
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,990 
okay well this is pretty much the
process in the analysis

266
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,350 
but to highlight a number the issues and
emphasize these points

267
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,720 
why I like to do is illustrate

268
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,380 
somewhat this with a videotape
demonstration

269
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,340 
that in fact was made originally as part
of another course a course

270
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,400 
devoted entirely to

271
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,970 
digital signal processing which
essentially is discrete-time processing

272
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,080 
whether or not it's related to
continuous-time signals

273
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,690 
and what I'd like to now focus on

274
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,020 
are summer the details of that
demonstration

275
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,360 
in the demonstration the

276
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,440 
specific impulse response there

277
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,750 
is used for the digital filter

278
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,190 
or discrete-time filter is the one that
I show here

279
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,610 
and the Associated

280
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,149 
frequency response is the frequency
response

281
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:18,830 
love a discrete-time low-pass filter as
i indicate below

282
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,299 
and the cutoff frequency that filter as
i indicate the filter was designed as a

283
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,710 
discreet I felt with the cutoff
frequency hi over five

284
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,260 
and let me just draw your attention to
the fact that

285
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,289 
pie over five is also

286
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,230 
10 love to pie

287
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,510 
and so in fact the digital

288
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,039 
for discrete-time filter cutoff
frequency is a tenth

289
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,630 
to pie and as all stress again shortly

290
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,730 
remember that in the frequency
normalization

291
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,620 
or a normalization to pie represents

292
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,000 
in effect the sampling frequency and so

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,220 
the consequence of that is that cutoff
frequency really is going to be

294
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,399 
associated

295
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,750 
with the 10th all the sampling frequency
but for now keep in mind that is just

296
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,840 
simply attentive to

297
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,279 
on now the

298
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,020 
equivalent continuous-time

299
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,370 
system interns are the impulse response

300
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,840 
is of course a ban limited interpolation

301
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,350 
love the up the

302
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,429 
impose response associated with the
discrete-time

303
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,320 
filter and in the frequency domain the
frequency response

304
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,740 
is correspondingly a timescale

305
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,940 
and a timescale I'm sorry a frequency
scale

306
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,500 
version at the frequency response so in
fact

307
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,919 
in the frequency domain and in the time
domain

308
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,730 
related to the continuous-time signal

309
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,830 
the Associated impulse response is

310
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,750 
what I indicate here a ban limited
interpolation

311
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,980 
or the discrete-time impulse response

312
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,380 
and time scale than

313
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,360 
and the frequency response following the
discussion that we've previously gone

314
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,450 
through

315
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,659 
is a frequency scale version all the one
associated with the digital filter

316
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,080 
well the first thing that all want to
look at is

317
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,610 
the impulse response and when we do

318
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,220 
let me just indicate that

319
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,649 
in the actual implementation things are
slightly different

320
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,750 
then they are associated with the ideal
analysis

321
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,049 
in particular in converting

322
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,929 
from a discrete-time sequence

323
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:50,570 
to the continuous-time signal whereas

324
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,580 
this way of looking at it is convenient

325
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,909 
in the context that the analysis in fact
the way it's done

326
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,090 
is is using more or less

327
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,870 
standard digital to analog converter

328
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,120 
one what a digital to analog converter
does as i indicated in the previous

329
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,230 
lecture

330
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,380 
is to convert the sequence

331
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,399 
not to an impulse train but in fact to
go directly through

332
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,039 
zero-order hold and so usually what
comes onto

333
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,370 
a digital to analog converter is a
staircase

334
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,179 
tightness signal associated with the
zero-order hold

335
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,620 
and then the result of that is low-pass
filter to do the reconstruction

336
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,980 
so what we want to look at and is

337
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,200 
that reconstruction first with just an
impulse input

338
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,830 
and so what we'll see after the low-pass
filter

339
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,750 
for the impulse response is

340
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,370 
a smooth curve like this but also as
part of the demonstration

341
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,870 
what all do just to show the zero-order
hold

342
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,490 
is to take the low-pass filter out
temporarily

343
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,840 
and then put it back in so first let's
just look at

344
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,019 
the filter impulse response

345
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,200 
what we see here is the impost response

346
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,080 
all the overall system and

347
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,909 
we observe for one thing that it's a
symmetrical impulse response in other

348
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,149 
words corresponds to a linear phase
filter

349
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:28,970 
we can also look at the impulse response
before that the same playing

350
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,409 
low-pass filter let's take out that the
sampling low-pass filter

351
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,460 
slowly and wide

352
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,500 
we observe is basically the output I'll

353
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,230 
the digital to analog converter which of
course is a staircase a boxcar function

354
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,260 
not an impulse train in the real world
the

355
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,600 
output over the day converted generally
is a boxcar type function

356
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,610 
we can put the the sampling filter back
in now

357
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,490 
and notice that the effectivity sampling
filter is basically

358
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,809 
to smooth out the rough edges in

359
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,590 
the boxcar output from the DA converter

360
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,210 
okay so that's the impulse response the
system

361
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,929 
now what I like to show is the frequency

362
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,559 
response the system and to measure the
frequency response of course what we can

363
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,029 
do

364
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,070 
is put a sine wave

365
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,710 
into the system and looked at

366
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:33,230 
the sinusoidal output so in particular
now what will happen is that

367
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,529 
with the system we will put in

368
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,179 
a continuous-time sinusoid which is
sampled

369
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,380 
converted to a sequence

370
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,690 
the sample continues sigh sinus so it is
a discrete-time sinusoid

371
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,700 
that goes through the digital filter and
gets attenuated or

372
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,809 
amplified appropriately and then

373
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,440 
the output if that is converted back and
that's

374
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,470 
again a sinusoidal output that gets
converted back

375
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,049 
to a continuous-time sinusoid

376
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,500 
theoretically as i indicate here but
again as we just saw

377
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,460 
really represented by zero-order hold
followed by

378
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,909 
a low-pass filter so thats

379
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,149 
the overall operation with one

380
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:25,350 
modification from the diagram that we
have here

381
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,350 
in this particular diagram I've included

382
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,570 
a and anti-aliasing filter

383
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,580 
in fact in the demonstration there is no

384
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,750 
anti-aliasing filter and so

385
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,330 
in fact the input is a sinusoidal input

386
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,760 
which is not band limited

387
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,159 
by virtue of an anti-aliasing filter
it's only

388
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,200 
course been limited appropriately

389
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,559 
if we choose the sinusoidal frequency
that way

390
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,100 
so there is no anti-aliasing filter and
this is the system

391
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,139 
and one consequence if that

392
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:08,880 
is dead in fact if we sweep

393
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,779 
the input sinusoid only up to half the
sampling frequency

394
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,919 
will see no aliasing but if we let its
we passed that we're going to get

395
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,120 
aliasing

396
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,820 
now in the demonstration the sampling
rate

397
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,940 
its picked for this party the
demonstration is a 20 kilohertz sampling

398
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,820 
rate

399
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,529 
that means based on the sampling theorem
that as long as the input frequency

400
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:39,309 
is below 10 killer hurts we get no
aliasing

401
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:43,029 
when the input frequency goes beyond 10
killer hurts

402
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:46,799 
that higher frequency is going to get
alias down

403
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,279 
into a lower frequency a consequence is
that then

404
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,330 
is that as we go through the process
saying

405
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,429 
and we demonstrate the frequency
response to the system

406
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,130 
what we'll see in the output is

407
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,690 
no alias saying when the input is below
10 killer hurts

408
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,970 
as the input sweeps past 10 killer hurts

409
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,909 
when when we let it which we will
eventually in the demonstration

410
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:16,510 
dan in fact that frequency as it finally
shows up here

411
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,889 
will begin to be aliased down into a
lower frequency

412
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,950 
another way thinking about that is dead

413
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,269 
when we watch the frequency response

414
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,809 
love the system as

415
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,510 
we look at the digital filter frequency
response

416
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,320 
what we're sweeping and as we go from
zero

417
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,630 
up to 10 killer hurts

418
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,019 
in the input frequency is this portion
of the frequency response

419
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,019 
as we sweep from 10 killer hurts out to
20 kilohertz

420
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:57,200 
what we'll see is this portion the
frequency response

421
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,909 
in other words will see it periodically
replicate

422
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:04,539 
or if we look at the

423
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,049 
corresponding continuous-time frequency
response

424
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,080 
what it means really is that sweeping

425
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,370 
from 0 to 10 killer hurts

426
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,590 
is moving up this way and then sweeping
from 10 killer hurts

427
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,100 
to 20 kilohertz on the input

428
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,350 
really because if the alias saying

429
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,850 
reflects itself in a digital filter by

430
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,630 
looking back down it toward lower
frequencies and so the continuous-time

431
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,720 
filter

432
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,639 
sweeps back down from 10 killer hurts

433
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,039 
back 20 okay

434
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,370 
so that so we'll see and we'll see it in
several different ways as explained in

435
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,600 
the demonstration

436
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,840 
so now let's look and the frequency
response

437
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,399 
sold now we like to illustrate

438
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,720 
is the frequency response love the
acquittal in continuous-time

439
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,860 
filter and we can do that by sweeping
the filter with a sinusoidal input

440
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,360 
so what we'll see in this demonstration
is

441
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,759 
on the upper trace the input sinusoid on
the lower trace the output sinusoid

442
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,850 
using a 20 kilohertz sampling rate in a
sweep

443
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,929 
from 0 to 10 killer hurts in other words
a sweep from 0 to

444
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:23,350 
effectively hi interns at the digital
filter

445
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,090 
so work will observe as the input
frequency increases

446
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,779 
is that the output sinusoid will have
essentially constant amplitude

447
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,419 
up to the cutoff frequency the filter
and then approximately zero amplitude

448
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,600 
past so let's now sweet the filter

449
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,570 
frequency response

450
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,799 
and the area is the filter

451
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:55,330 
cutoff frequency

452
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,320 
now we can also observe the filter
frequency response in

453
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,260 
several other ways one way in which we
can observe it is by

454
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,650 
looking also at the amplitude if the
output sinusoid as

455
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,640 
a function of frequency rather than as a
function of time

456
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,270 
and so will observe that on the
left-hand SCO

457
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,320 
while on the right-hand scope will have
the same trace their we just saw

458
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,960 
namely to traces the upper traces the
input sinusoid

459
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,870 
the lower traces the output sinusoid and
in addition to observing

460
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,370 
the frequency response let's also listen
to the output sinusoid

461
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,400 
and observe the attenuation

462
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,850 
in the output as we go from the field to
pass band to the filter stopping again a

463
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,530 
20 kilohertz sampling rate

464
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:49,530 
and a sweep range from 0 to 10 killer
now

465
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,400 
course when the filter stop

466
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,150 
now if we increase the sweep range

467
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,380 
from 10 killer hurts the 20 kilohertz

468
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,850 
so that the sweep range is equal to the
sampling frequency

469
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,550 
in essence that corresponds the sweeping
at the digital filter

470
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,250 
from 0 to 2pi and in that case we'll
begin to see

471
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,030 
some %uh the periodicity in the digital
filter frequency response

472
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,340 
so let's do that now with 20 kilohertz
sampling rate

473
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,340 
and a sweep range is 0 to 20 kilohertz

474
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:34,750 
now as we come near to Pine

475
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,160 
we get back into the past

476
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,250 
an finally back to

477
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,920 
a0 to 10 killer hurts we so they were
again sweeping

478
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,920 
only from 0 to 2pi with regard to the
digital filter

479
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,099 
now an important observation is that

480
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,639 
with the digital or discrete-time

481
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:16,179 
filter cutoff frequency fixed as i've
indicated here

482
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,139 
and I remind you that what the cutoff
frequency is

483
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:24,799 
is a 10 to hi with that cutoff frequency
fixed

484
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,009 
because I love the normalization that we
get

485
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:31,479 
as we come back to a continuous-time

486
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:34,599 
filter in fact what we have

487
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,159 
is a cutoff frequency dead is

488
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,299 
dependent on the sampling frequency or
on the sampling period

489
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,449 
and more specifically since the
discrete-time or digital

490
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:50,819 
filter has a cutoff frequency which is
attentive to pie

491
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,849 
the normalization as you recall

492
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:58,349 
is dead to pie in discrete-time
frequency

493
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,219 
corresponds to Omega sed s/ the sampling
frequency

494
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:06,289 
in terms of continuous-time frequency
the consequence

495
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:10,169 
is dead this cutoff frequency in fact

496
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,819 
is 110 all

497
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:17,609 
not to pine now because at the
normalization its 110

498
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:20,909 
I'll the sampling frequency so

499
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,519 
consequently as we change the sampling
frequency

500
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,199 
what will happen is that even with the
discrete-time filter cutoff fixed

501
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:34,759 
the cutoff frequency I'll the equivalent
continuous-time

502
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,389 
filter will change now

503
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,669 
that's what I want to demonstrate but
let me

504
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,789 
again stress and ask you to keep in mind
dead

505
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:48,949 
this demonstration is done without an
anti-aliasing filter in

506
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:54,599 
and we are going to be changing the
sampling frequency

507
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,119 
and so keep in mind dead as

508
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,559 
we look at this as the input frequency

509
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,439 
sweeps past half the sampling frequency
whatever sampling frequency we happen to

510
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,329 
be looking at

511
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:12,239 
then because the fact that there's no
anti-aliasing filter

512
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:17,239 
will get daily as saying in other words
the frequency in the digital filter

513
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:20,879 
discrete-time filter as we sweep the
input frequency up

514
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,279 
will move up in frequency until we get

515
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,539 
past half the sampling frequency and
then essentially will move back down

516
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,690 
frequency consequently what will get

517
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,169 
then are or we'll see our periodic
replications

518
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:41,159 
the frequency response when we swept
past have see half the sampling alright

519
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,119 
so now

520
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,299 
let's look at the same digital filter

521
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,539 
but the frequency response as

522
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,519 
we change the sampling frequency now

523
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,239 
what we would like to demonstrate is the
effective changing the same thing

524
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,479 
frequency and we know that

525
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:03,779 
the sampling that the effective filter
cutoff frequency

526
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,029 
is tied to the sampling frequency

527
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:10,529 
and for this particular filter
corresponds to attend

528
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:15,450 
of the sampling frequency consequently
if we double the sampling frequency we

529
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,149 
should double

530
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,119 
the affective filter past and where war

531
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,319 
double the filter cutoff frequency and

532
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:27,659 
so let's do that now it again is 0-10
killer hurt sweep range

533
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,779 
but a forty kilohertz sampling frequency

534
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:35,089 
me and

535
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:39,450 
we should observe that the filter cutoff
frequency has now doubled

536
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:44,119 
out 24 killer now

537
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,480 
let's begin to decrease the filter
sampling frequency

538
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,960 
so from forty let's change the sampling
frequency to 20 kilohertz

539
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,960 
we should see the cutoff frequency cut
in half me

540
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:09,749 
now we can go even further we can cut
the sampling frequency down

541
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:13,910 
10 killer hurts and remember that the
sweep range is 0 to 10 killer hurt so

542
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,450 
now will be sweeping from 0 to 2pi

543
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:23,450 
so as we get close to two pi will see
the passband again

544
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,700 
and now

545
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,769 
let's cut down the sampling frequency
even further

546
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,999 
to by kilohertz my

547
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:42,519 
here we are at 2pi

548
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,859 
and then

549
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:50,369 
at for pop alright so

550
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:54,109 
that illustrates the effective changing
the sampling frequency

551
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:57,799 
now let's conclude this demonstration at
the effect

552
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:01,950 
on the sampling frequency on the filter
cutoff frequency by carrying out some

553
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,680 
filtering

554
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,779 
on some live audio white will

555
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,869 
watching this case is the output

556
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,690 
audio waveform as a function of time

557
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,970 
on the single trace go and also

558
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,230 
will listen to the output will begin it
with a forty killer hurts

559
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,069 
sampling rate then reduce that to 20
kilohertz 10 killer hurts and then five

560
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:25,789 
alerts

561
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:29,970 
and in each of those cases the effective
filter cutoff frequency

562
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,980 
then is cut in half from for keywords to
kill hurts

563
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,880 
21 kilohertz and then to 500 cycles so
let's begin with the forty killer hurt

564
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160 
sampling frequency

565
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,160 
or ineffective filter cutoff frequency
of work killer

566
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,040 
now let's reduce net 20 kilohertz am

567
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,040 
frequency or to kill hurts filter

568
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,130 
and 10 kelleher sampling frequency

569
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,319 
the

570
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,170 
the

571
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,799 
then finally in my Google Earth family

572
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,910 
cigars running to me why minor in Psych
grueling

573
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:20,890 
analog all the

574
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,690 
I now let's finally include why
returning to

575
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,470 
a little higher quality ragtime like me
the same

576
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:35,470 
theme

577
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,590 
right well hopefully

578
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,720 
what you've seen in the demonstration
and in this lecture

579
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,530 
is gives you a sense of feeling

580
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,580 
for the analysis and the use

581
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,740 
I'll discrete-time filters

582
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,800 
for processing continuous-time signals
and

583
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,200 
as you may be aware and as I've tried to
indicate

584
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,370 
previously in the past this in fact is

585
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,710 
one very important but not the only but
one very important

586
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,930 
context in which discrete-time filtering

587
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,320 
issues and this in fact is

588
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,550 
an area that is developing rapidly
because at the fact dead

589
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,900 
microprocessors digital technology
computers et cetera

590
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,290 
afford considerable flexibility

591
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,090 
in carrying out digital processing of
signals

592
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:35,510 
and it is and went digital processing is
used at

593
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,800 
naturally corresponds

594
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,080 
to to implementing the processing

595
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,780 
and analyzing it in discrete-time now

596
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,940 
in the next lecture will be continuing

597
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,520 
on another aspect developing another
aspect

598
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,560 
love sampling any particular

599
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,080 
what we'll be talking about is sampling
of discrete-time signals

600
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,290 
as all indicate there one of the
contexts in which

601
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,170 
discrete-time sampling in fact plays an
important role

602
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,480 
is in the context in which

603
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,950 
we are processing continuous-time
signals

604
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,320 
using discrete time processing where in
fact

605
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,720 
one step that we might want to take in
addition to the steps that we've talked

606
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,880 
about here

607
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,780 
is an additional sampling process
following

608
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,330 
whatever kinds of filtering that we that
we do well that's a discussion and a

609
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,850 
topic that will be going into in the
next lecture

610
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,270 
thank you
