00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Brian good evening the Supreme Court has already rolled corporations have free speech rights now it has agreed to take a big question it is never answered before do private companies also have freedom of religion

00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the Oklahoma family that owns the Hobby Lobby with more than 550 arts and craft stores nationwide employed 13000 people does the company is found on religious principles

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we believe how hard to believe that it is by God's grace improvision the Hobby Lobby has been successful

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
therefore we see Don Hammond all that we do

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
what is providing insurance coverage for contraceptive measures like the morning after pill is the equivalent of paying for abortion violating is religious freedom

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
just as in the TV series the CIA try to turn hardcore 1 Tomo detainees in a double agents make them back into a car

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it would be responsible for the CIA or other intelligence organizations not to use these detainees to help protect United States against Detroit axe and that might well include using these operas as future agents to disrupt other attacks

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:13,000

what day was always attract that was back Turnagain is a terrorist attack the US

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it was very ill conceived program for them to think that because these are some very hardcore individuals and many homes have been released by both administrations have gotten back in to fight us in our allies unfortunately

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:47,000

what princess is getting a lot of attention tonight for the mission statement gestation for the Catholic Church she would like to see in the future

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it was a kind of summary of a lot of things he's been saying lately he writes that the church must reform itself and pay more attention to the poor Ilsa wrote the church must quote abandon the complacent attitude that says we have always done it this way

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
notably he does go on to make clear the church doctrine on issues like abortion will not change elsewhere on the Pope schedule

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
so we naturally figure it would be visible from space and we couldn't help but notice using one of the members many International Space Station web trackers

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
