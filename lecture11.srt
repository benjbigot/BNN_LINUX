the new the last time

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,470 
we began the development love the
discrete-time

11
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,540 
for EA transform and

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,340 
just days with the continuous-time case
we first

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,660 
treated the notion a periodic signals
this led to the forty a series

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,740 
and then we generalize that to the
Fourier transform

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,140 
and finally incorporated within the
framework for the four th

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,310 
transform both a periodic and periodic
signals

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,630 
in today's lecture but I'd like to do

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,830 
is expand on some other properties

19
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,009 
love for EA transform and indicate how
those properties are used for a variety

20
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,190 
of things

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,130 
well let's begin by reviewing the
Fourier transform

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,710 
as we develop did last time it of course
involves

23
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,780 
a synthesis equation and and analysis
equation

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,729 
the synthesis equation expressing X a
van

25
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,540 
the sequence in terms of the Fourier
transform

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,330 
any analysis equation telling us how to
obtain

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,299 
the Fourier transform from the original
sequence

28
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,659 
and I draw your attention again to

29
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,989 
the basic point that the synthesis
equation

30
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,959 
essentially corresponds to decomposing

31
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,440 
the sequence as a linear combination

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,600 
of complex exponentials with amplitude
said are in effect

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,400 
proportional to the 48 transport now

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,090 
in the discrete-time Fourier transform
just as the continuous-time

35
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,380 
for a transform has a number all

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,920 
important and useful properties of
course

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280 
as i stress last time it's a function 0

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,340 
a continuous variable and it's also a
complex-valued function

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,959 
which means dead when we represented in
general

40
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720 
requires a representation in terms of
its

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,930 
real part an imaginary part or in terms
of magnitude and angle

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,239 
also as i indicated last time

43
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,380 
the Fourier transform is

44
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,930 
a periodic function of frequency

45
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,290 
and the periodicity is

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,669 
with a period up to par i and

47
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:21,829 
so it says in effect dead the Fourier
transform if we replace the frequency

48
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,760 
variable

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,810 
by an integer multiple to pie

50
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,310 
the function repeats and I stress again

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,480 
that the underlying basis

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,510 
for this periodicity property is the
fact

53
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,750 
that its the setup complex exponentials

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,870 
that are inherently periodic in
frequency

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,620 
and so of course any representation
using them would

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,850 
in effect generate a

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,030 
periodicity with this period of two pi

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,769 
just an is

59
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,320 
in continuous-time the Fourier transform
has

60
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,959 
important symmetry properties and in
particular

61
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,040 
if the sequence x7 is

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,280 
real value an the 4e

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,370 
transform is conjugate symmetric

64
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,919 
in other words if we replace Omega by
minus Omega

65
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,570 
that's equivalent to applying complex
conjugation to the 48 transport and

66
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,910 
as a cock consequence this conjugate
symmetry

67
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,110 
this results in asymmetry

68
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,699 
in the real part that is an even
symmetry

69
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,930 
or the magnitude has an even symmetry

70
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,820 
whereas the imaginary part or the phase
angle

71
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,000 
is are are both art summit and these are
symmetry properties again

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400 
that are identical to the symmetry
properties that we saw in

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,260 
continuous-time

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,909 
well let's see this in the context I'll
an example that we worked last time and

75
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,210 
that

76
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,220 
will want to draw attention to

77
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,729 
in reference to several issues is this
lecture goes along

78
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,780 
and that is the Fourier transform all

79
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,370 
a real damp expanding exponential

80
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,960 
so the sequence that we

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,379 
are talking about is a to the end you
have an

82
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,590 
and let's consider a to be positive

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,720 
we saw last time that the Fourier
transform from the for this sequence

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,460 
algebraically is up this form

85
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,770 
and if we look at its magnitude and
angle

86
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,120 
the magnet to I show here

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,139 
and the magnitude as we see has the
properties that we indicated

88
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,439 
is and even function of frequency

89
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,139 
course it's a function of a continuous
variable

90
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,189 
and it in addition is periodic

91
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,280 
with a period of two part

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,060 
on the other hand if we look at the
phase angle below it

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,330 
the phase angle has a symmetry which is
ought symmetric

94
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,659 
and that's indicated clearly in this
picture

95
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:13,659 
and of course in addition to being eyed
symmetric it naturally has to be

96
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,729 
again a periodic function of frequency

97
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,069 
with the period up to par

98
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,780 
okay so we have some symmetry properties
we have this inherent periodicity in the

99
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,449 
48 transform which

100
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,280 
arms stressing very heavily because it
forms

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,180 
the basic difference between
continuous-time and discrete-time

102
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,460 
in addition to these properties have the
four EA transform

103
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,039 
there are a number of other properties

104
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,080 
day are particularly useful in

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,719 
the manipulation of the 48 transform and
in fact

106
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:54,699 
using the Fourier transform to for
example

107
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,800 
an ally systems represented by when
you're past the coefficient difference

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,629 
equations

109
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,650 
bear in the text is a

110
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,020 
longer list the properties but let me
just draw your attention

111
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,069 
to several of them one

112
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,199 
is the time shifting property

113
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,759 
and the time shifting property tells us
dead

114
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,340 
if Xserve Omega is the Fourier transform

115
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,900 
objective and then the Fourier transform

116
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,930 
are x7 shifted in time

117
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,939 
is that same for EA transform multiplied
by

118
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,680 
this factor which is a with your face
fact

119
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,699 
so time-shifting introduces

120
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,610 
a linear phase turn and by the way I
recall

121
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,469 
that in the continuous-time case we had
a similar situation namely that a

122
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,520 
timeshare

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039 
corresponded to a linear phase

124
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,719 
there also is a dual to the time
shifting property

125
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,999 
which is referred to as the frequency
shifting property

126
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:04,419 
which tells us dead if we

127
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,379 
multiply a time function by a complex
exponential

128
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,449 
that in effect generates

129
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,800 
a frequency share and will see this
frequency shifting property

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,389 
surface in a slightly different way
shortly

131
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:24,840 
when we talk about the modulation
property in the discrete-time case

132
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,059 
another important property that will
want to make you so

133
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:33,710 
shortly is Lenny arity which follows in
a very straightforward way from

134
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,870 
the Fourier transform definition

135
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,630 
and the linearity property says simply

136
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,580 
that the 48 transform of Assam

137
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,990 
or linear combination is the same with
your combination the Fourier transforms

138
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,760 
again that's a property that we saw in
continuous-time

139
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,180 
and also among other properties

140
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,520 
there is a parser balls relation for the
discrete-time case

141
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,110 
then in effect says something similar to
continuous-time

142
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,360 
specifically dead the energy E

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,840 
in the sequence is proportional

144
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,170 
to the energy E in the 48 transform

145
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,790 
the energy over one period or said
another way

146
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,079 
in fact or another way that it can be
said is

147
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,760 
that the energy in the time domain is
proportional to the power

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,010 
in his periodic for a transport

149
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,260 
okay so these are some other properties

150
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,019 
in and are the as i indicated parallel
somewhat properties that we saw in

151
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,120 
continuous-time

152
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,610 
two additional properties their will
play important roles

153
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,810 
indiscreet I'm just as they did in
continuous-time

154
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:53,740 
are the convolution property and the
modulation property

155
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,579 
the convolution property is the property
that tells us

156
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:01,310 
how to relate the Fourier transform

157
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,800 
all the convolution two sequences

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,949 
to the Fourier transforms of the
individual sequences

159
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,389 
and not surprisingly what happens and
this can be

160
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:17,019 
demonstrated algebraically not
surprisingly

161
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,370 
the four EA transform above the
convolution

162
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,990 
is simply the product of the Fourier
transforms

163
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,380 
so Fourier transform maps

164
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,639 
convolution in the time domain the
multiplication in the frequency domain

165
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,610 
now convolutional courses arises in the
context of linear time-invariant systems

166
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,100 
in particular if we have a system with
an impulse response a true fan

167
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,720 
input excessive and the output is the
convolution

168
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,089 
the convolution property then tells us
dead

169
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,130 
in the frequency domain for EA transform

170
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,670 
is the product love the Fourier
transform

171
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,120 
the impulse response and the forty a
transformer the input

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,230 
now we also saw

173
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,790 
and have talked about a relationship
between

174
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,130 
the Fourier transform the impulse
response and what we called

175
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,389 
the frequency response

176
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,339 
in the context love the response to the
system

177
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,170 
to a complex exponential specifically

178
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:33,250 
complex exponentials are I can functions
have linear time-invariant systems

179
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,690 
wanna be's into the system gives us as
an output

180
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,050 
a complex exponential with the same
complex frequency

181
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,899 
multiplied by what you referred to as
the eye can value

182
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,370 
and as you saw in the

183
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,380 
video course manual this I can value
this constant multiplier

184
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,389 
on the exponential is in fact

185
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,579 
the 48 transform up the impulse response

186
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,490 
evaluated at that frequency

187
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,940 
now we saw exactly the same statement

188
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,440 
in continuous-time and in fact we use

189
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,100 
that statement the frequency response
interpretation

190
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,050 
love the 48 trance for the impulse
response

191
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,519 
we use that to motivate and intuitive
interpretation

192
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,959 
of the convolution property now formally
the convolution property can be

193
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,470 
developed by

194
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,899 
taking the convolution some applying the
Fourier transforms into it

195
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,370 
doing the appropriate substitution
variables in a changing order summations

196
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,000 
Center in all the algebra

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,850 
works out to show that it's a product
but as I stressed

198
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,139 
when we discussed this with continuous
time the interpretation the underlying

199
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,180 
interpretation

200
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,500 
is particularly important to understand
so let me review it again

201
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,819 
in the discrete-time case and it's
exactly the same

202
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,350 
for discrete-time for continuous-time

203
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,449 
specifically the argument was that the
Fourier transform

204
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:12,339 
all a sequence or signal

205
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,730 
corresponds to decomposing it into a
linear combination of complex

206
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,339 
exponentials

207
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,050 
what the airport to those complex
exponentials its

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,980 
basically proportional to the four EA
transport

209
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,790 
if we think a pushing through the system
that linear combination

210
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,130 
then each love those complex
exponentials

211
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,430 
gets the airport to modified are
multiplied

212
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,160 
by the Fourier transform all up by the
frequency response

213
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,110 
which we saw is the Fourier transform
love the impulse response

214
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,870 
so the airport to up the output complex
exponentials

215
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,250 
is then the amplitudes of the input
complex exponentials

216
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,480 
multiplied by the frequency response

217
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,600 
and the Fourier transform the output in
effect

218
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,810 
is an expression its expressing the
summation

219
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:15,839 
or integration of the output as a linear
combination of all of these exponentials

220
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,629 
with the appropriate complex amplitudes

221
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,910 
so its important in thinking about

222
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,220 
the convolution property to think about
it in terms

223
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,399 
a nothing more then the fact that we
decompose the input

224
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,769 
and we're now modifying separately

225
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:40,139 
through multiplication scaling

226
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:47,139 
the airport to or each of the complex
exponential company

227
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,050 
now what we saw in continuous time is
that this interpretation

228
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,069 
and the convolution property

229
00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:00,620 
lead to an important concept namely the
concept the filtering

230
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,160 
kind of the idea that if we decompose
the input as a linear combination of

231
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,750 
complex exponentials

232
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,720 
we can separately attenuator amplify

233
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,899 
each of those compounds and in fact

234
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,480 
we could exactly pass some center
frequencies and totally eliminate other

235
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,170 
center frequencies

236
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,800 
so again just as in continuous-time

237
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,139 
we can talk about an ideal filter

238
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,620 
and what I show here is the frequency
response

239
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,930 
love idea low-pass filter

240
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,440 
the idea low-pass filter of course
passes

241
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,579 
exactly with a gain of one

242
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,259 
frequencies around zero and eliminates

243
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:55,029 
totally other frequencies

244
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,370 
however an important distinction here
between continuous-time and

245
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,959 
discrete-time

246
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,709 
is the fact that whereas in continuous
time when we talked about an ideal

247
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,550 
filter

248
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,720 
we passed a band of frequencies and
totally eliminate everything else out to

249
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,089 
infinity

250
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,829 
in a discrete-time case the frequency
response

251
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,850 
is periodic so obviously

252
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,970 
the frequency response must periodically
repeat

253
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,689 
the low low-pass filter and in fact we
see that here

254
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,779 
if we look at the low-pass filter

255
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,259 
then we've eliminated some frequencies

256
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,759 
but then we passive course frequencies

257
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,649 
around to pie and also frequencies

258
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,310 
around minus 25 for that matter around
any multiple

259
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,610 
to pie although it's important to
recognize

260
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,899 
that because of the inherent periodicity
at the complex exponentials

261
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,250 
these frequencies are exactly the same
frequencies

262
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,420 
as these frequencies so

263
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,630 
its low-pass filtering interpreted in
terms of frequencies over a range

264
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,150 
from minus buy the pie

265
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,829 
well just as we talk about a low-pass
filter we can also talk about

266
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,470 
a high pass filter and a high pass
filter course with

267
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,800 
past high frequencies

268
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,170 
in a continuous-time case high
frequencies man frequencies that

269
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,870 
go out to infinity in the discrete-time
case

270
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,800 
course the highest frequencies we can
generate our frequencies up the pie

271
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,200 
and wants are complex exponentials go
past pie

272
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,110 
then in fact we start seeing the lower
frequencies again might be

273
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,500 
indicate what I mean if we think

274
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,310 
in the context of the low-pass filter
these are low frequencies

275
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,360 
as we move along the frequency axis
these become high frequencies

276
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,860 
and as we move further along the
frequency axis

277
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,240 
what we'll see when we get to for
example frequency

278
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,070 
to pie are the same low frequencies

279
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,230 
that we see around zero a particular
then

280
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,440 
a and i do. high pass filter in the
discrete-time case

281
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,840 
would be a filter that eliminates these
frequencies

282
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,610 
and passes frequencies around pie

283
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,670 
okay so and we've seen the

284
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,560 
convolution property and its
interpretation in terms of filtering

285
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,570 
more broadly the convolution property in
combination

286
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,300 
with a number of the other properties
today introduced in particular the time

287
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,540 
shifting and when the arity property

288
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,990 
allows us to generator analyzes

289
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,640 
the an ally systems that are described
by linear constant coefficient

290
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080 
difference equations

291
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,630 
and this again pareles very strongly

292
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,770 
the discussion that we carried out in
the continuous-time

293
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,010 
case their particular let's

294
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,340 
think I love a discrete-time system

295
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,910 
there is described by when your car is
the coefficient difference equation

296
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,270 
and will restrict the initial conditions
on the equation

297
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,350 
such that it corresponds to linear
time-invariant system

298
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,960 
and recall that in fact in our
discussion

299
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,300 
when your constant coefficient
difference equations

300
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,440 
is the condition of initial rest

301
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,470 
there on the equation that guarantees

302
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,660 
4s that the system will be causal linear
and time-invariant

303
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,720 
okay now let's consider

304
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,180 
a first-order difference equation system
described by first-order difference

305
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,880 
equation and we've talked about the
solution of this equation before

306
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,030 
essentially we run the solution recur
simply

307
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,960 
let's now consider generating the
solution by

308
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,240 
taking advantage the properties the
forty a transport

309
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,170 
well just as we did in continuous time
we can consider

310
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,230 
applying to 48 transformed to both sides
of this equation

311
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,500 
and the Fourier transform are why I have
been

312
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,640 
courses y Omega and then using the
shifting

313
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240 
property the time shifting property the
Fourier transform why event -1

314
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,630 
is y Omega multiplied by

315
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,850 
you to the minus jail make and so we
have this

316
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,110 
using the when the arity property we can
carry down the scale factor in and these

317
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,300 
two together as they read it here

318
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,540 
and forty a transformer victim and is XO
make

319
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,580 
well Wii console this equation

320
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,650 
the Fourier transform of the output in
terms of the Fourier transform

321
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,030 
up the input and a

322
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,700 
inappropriate complex scale factor and
simply solving this

323
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,810 
for y Omega yields what we have here

324
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,760 
now what we've used in going from this
point to this point

325
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,910 
is both the shifting property

326
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,880 
and we've also used the linearity
property

327
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,110 
at this point we can recognize that

328
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,680 
here the Fourier transform the output is
the product

329
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,910 
the Fourier transform of the input and

330
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,600 
some complex function and from the
convolution property

331
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,380 
then that complex function must in fact

332
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,880 
correspond to the frequency response

333
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,220 
or acquittal atlee the 48 transform

334
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,350 
love the impulse response so if we
wanted to determine the Fourier

335
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,330 
transform

336
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,260 
or the or where the impulse response to
the system

337
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,910 
let's say for example then it becomes a
matter

338
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,810 
love having identified the 4e a
transformer the impulse response which

339
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,590 
is the frequency response

340
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,590 
we now want to inverse transform to get
the impulse response

341
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,100 
well how do we inverse transform of
course we could do it by attempting to

342
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,990 
go through the synthesis equation

343
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,280 
for the Fourier transform or we can do
is we did

344
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,710 
in a continuous-time case which is to
take advantage

345
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,430 
I love what we know and in particular

346
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,590 
we know dead from an example that we
work before

347
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,850 
this is in fact the 48 transform

348
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,160 
all a sequence which is

349
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,220 
a to the N times

350
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,730 
you then and so in essence by inspection

351
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,170 
very similar to what has going on can

352
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,570 
in continuous-time essentially by
inspection

353
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,400 
we can then solve for the impulse
response to the system

354
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,440 
okay so that procedure follows very much

355
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,390 
the kind of procedure that we've carried
out in continuous-time

356
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,470 
and this is the course is discussed in
more detail

357
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,840 
in the text well let's

358
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,930 
a look at that example

359
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,930 
then here we have the impulse response

360
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,770 
for that for associated with the system
described by that particular

361
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,040 
difference equation and to the right of
that

362
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,150 
we have the Associated frequency
response

363
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,200 
and one other things that we notice and
this is drawn for a

364
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,380 
positive between 0&1 what we noticed in
fact is that

365
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,660 
it is an approximation to

366
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,280 
a low-pass filter because it tends to
attenuate

367
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,460 
the high frequencies and retain and in
fact

368
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,340 
amplify the low-frequency now

369
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,160 
if instead actually the impulse response

370
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,790 
was such that we picked a to be negative
between minus 10

371
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:08,110 
and the impulse response in the time
domain looks like this

372
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,880 
and the corresponding frequency response

373
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,660 
looks like this and that becomes an
approximation

374
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,810 
to a high pass filter

375
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,020 
so in fact a first-order difference
equation

376
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,040 
as we see has a frequency response
depending on the value obey

377
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,520 
dad either looks approximately like a
low-pass filter for a positive or a high

378
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,180 
pass filter for a negative

379
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,300 
very much like the first order
differential equation

380
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,420 
looked like a low-pass filter in the
continuous-time

381
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,290 
case and in fact I'd like to illustrate

382
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,340 
is the filtering characteristics

383
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,620 
for example love filtering using
first-order difference equation

384
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,660 
and the example that a lil astray

385
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,670 
is filtering over sequence that in fact
is filtered very often

386
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,130 
for a very practical reasons namely a
sequence which represents the Dow Jones

387
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,710 
Industrial Average

388
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,930 
over a fairly long period and

389
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,880 
will process the Dow Jones Industrial
Average first

390
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,340 
through first-order difference equation
where if we begin

391
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,270 
with a sequel 0 then referring to the
frequency response

392
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,640 
that we have here equal 0 would simply
be

393
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,520 
passing all frequencies as a as positive

394
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,160 
we start to retain mostly low
frequencies

395
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,680 
and the larger a gets but still less
than 1

396
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,290 
the more it attenuates high frequencies
at the expensive low frequencies

397
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,760 
so let's watch the filtering first

398
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,200 
with a positive and we'll see if behave
as a low pass filter and then

399
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,490 
with a negative and we'll see

400
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:05,110 
the difference equation behaving as a
high pass filter

401
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,400 
what we see here is the Dow Jones
Industrial Average over

402
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,820 
roughly a five year period from 1927 to
1930 to

403
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,970 
and in fact that big dip in the middle

404
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,670 
is the famous stock market crash of 1929

405
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,050 
and we can see that following that in
fact the market continued

406
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,930 
a very long downward trend and

407
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,530 
what we now want to do is process this

408
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,680 
through a difference equation

409
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,360 
above the Dow Jones average we show the
impulse response to the difference

410
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,800 
equation here

411
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,080 
we've chosen the parameter a equal to 0

412
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,770 
and the impulse response will be
displayed on

413
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,390 
in expanded scale in relation to

414
00:26:53,390 --> 00:27:00,230 
the scale love the input and for that
matter the scale of the output

415
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,970 
now with the impulse response shown here
which is just an impulse

416
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,090 
in fact the output shown on the bottom
trace

417
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,890 
is exactly identical to the input

418
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,920 
and what will want to do now is increase

419
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,750 
first the parameter a and the impulse
response

420
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,440 
will begin to look like an exponential

421
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,330 
with a duration: that's longer and
longer as

422
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,710 
a moves from 0 to 1

423
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,920 
correspondingly we will get more and
more low pass filtering as the

424
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,010 
coefficient a

425
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,430 
increases from 0 toward one so now

426
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,910 
we are increasing the parameter a we see
that

427
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,960 
the bottom trace in relation to the
middle trace in fact is

428
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,410 
looking more and more smooth or

429
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,550 
low-pass filtered and here now we have

430
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:00,870 
a fair amount of smoothing to the point
where the stock market crash of 1929

431
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,980 
is totally lost in fact I'm sure there
are many people who

432
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,720 
wish that through filtering we could in
fact have avoided the stock market crash

433
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,930 
altogether

434
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,970 
now let's decrease

435
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,840 
a from one back toward zero

436
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,890 
and as we do that we will be taking out

437
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,760 
the low-pass filtering and when they
finally reaches

438
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,110 
0 the impulse response to the filter
will again

439
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,170 
be in in polls and so the output will be

440
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,370 
once again identical to the input

441
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,000 
and that's where we are now

442
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,080 
right now we want to continue to
decrease

443
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,230 
a so that it becomes negative moving

444
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,710 
from zero toward -1 and what we will see
in that case

445
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,770 
is more and more high-pass filtering

446
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,560 
on the output in relation to the input

447
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,070 
and this will be particularly evident in
again

448
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,050 
the region a pipe frequencies
represented by sharp transitions which

449
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,680 
of course

450
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,320 
the market crash goodnight 1929 would
represent

451
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,150 
so here now a is decreasing

452
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,410 
toward -1 we see that the high
frequencies

453
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,260 
or rapid variations are emphasize

454
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,280 
and finally let's move from -1

455
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,970 
back toward zero taking out the
high-pass filtering

456
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,450 
and ending up with

457
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,010 
equal to 0 corresponding to an impulse
response which is an impulse

458
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,680 
in other words and identity system and
let me stress once again that

459
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,530 
the time scale on which we displayed the
impulse response

460
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,590 
is an expanded time scale in relation to
the timescale

461
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:59,640 
on which we displayed the input and the
output

462
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,020 
okay so we see that in fact a

463
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,130 
first-order difference equation is

464
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,680 
a filter and in fact it's a very
important class the filters and its use

465
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,930 
very often to do

466
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,190 
approximate low-paying some high-pass
filtering

467
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,740 
now in addition to

468
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,320 
the convolution property another

469
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,810 
important property that we had in
continuous-time and that we have in

470
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,010 
discrete-time

471
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,810 
is the modulation property the
modulation property tells us

472
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,270 
what happens in the frequency domain
when

473
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,690 
you multiply signals in the time domain

474
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,090 
in continuous-time the modulation
property corresponded to the statement

475
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,390 
that if we multiply in the time domain

476
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,220 
we convolved the 48 transforms

477
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,730 
in the frequency domain and in
discrete-time

478
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,900 
we have very much the same

479
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,070 
kinda relationship

480
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,450 
the only real distinction between the

481
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,770 
is is that in the discrete-time case

482
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,300 
in carrying out the convolution its
integration

483
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,460 
only over a two-party interval and

484
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,960 
what that corresponds to is what's
referred to as

485
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,600 
a periodic convolution

486
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,530 
as opposed to the continuous-time case

487
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,110 
where what we have is a convolution

488
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,080 
that is a periodic on pollution

489
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,030 
so again we have a convolution property
in discrete-time

490
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,770 
that is very much like the convolution
property in continuous-time

491
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,360 
the only real difference is that here
work involving

492
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,950 
periodic functions and so

493
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,480 
its a periodic convolution which
involves integration only over to pie

494
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,330 
and herbal

495
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,710 
rather than in immigration from minus
infinity the question

496
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,000 
well let's and take a look at the

497
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,140 
example love the modulation property
which will then

498
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,830 
leave to one particular application and
a very useful application

499
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,140 
love the modulation property in
discrete-time

500
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,660 
example that I 12 pic is

501
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:34,700 
example in which we consider modulating
a signal

502
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,730 
with a signal with another signal

503
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,770 
X evander x1 event as i indicated

504
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,150 
here which is -1 to the end

505
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,210 
essentially with that says is that

506
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,610 
any signal which I modulate with this
effect corresponds to taking the

507
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,820 
original signal

508
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,170 
and then going through that signal
alternating

509
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,700 
the algebraic sign

510
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,000 
now we in in applying the modulation
property of course

511
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,380 
what we need to do is develop the 48
transform

512
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,910 
this signal this signal which I

513
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,940 
rewrite I can ride either is -1 to the
air to rewrite is you DJ pie and since

514
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,160 
you the J pie

515
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,220 
is equal to -1 is a periodic signal

516
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,710 
and if the periodic signal that I show
here

517
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,080 
and recall that to get the 48 transform
other periodic signal

518
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,570 
one way to do it is to

519
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,120 
generate the forty a series coefficients
for the periodic signal

520
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,980 
and then identify the Fourier transform
as an impulse train

521
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,710 
where the heights of the impulses in the
impulse train

522
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,630 
are proportional the proportionality
factor to pry

523
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,110 
proportional 240 a series coefficients

524
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,640 
so let's first workout what the for a
series is it for this example

525
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,710 
in fact it's fairly easy here is

526
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,879 
the general synthesis equation for

527
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:13,750 
the forty a series and

528
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,129 
if we take our particular example

529
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,609 
where if we look back at the curve above

530
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:25,149 
what we recognize is that the period

531
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:29,169 
is equal to 2 merely repeat after two
points

532
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:32,619 
then capital in is equal to two

533
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:36,389 
and so we can just write this out with
the two turns

534
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,540 
and the two terms involved are x1 a van
is a0

535
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,760 
0 go fishin as cake 0

536
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,050 
in a1 and this is with

537
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,500 
cake was one we substituted in capital
an equal to two

538
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,480 
right well we can do a little bit about
to bring here obviously

539
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,789 
cross of the factors to and what we
recognize

540
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:04,380 
if we compare this expression with

541
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,960 
the original signal which is you the
j-pop I N

542
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,140 
then we can simply identify the fact
dead

543
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,529 
80 0 coefficient is zero that's the DC
term

544
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:19,779 
and call fish in a1 is equal to 1

545
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:23,009 
so we've done it simply by essentially

546
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,220 
inspecting the for EA

547
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,930 
series synthesis equation

548
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,690 
okay now if we want to get the Fourier
transform for this we take those

549
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,319 
coefficients

550
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:40,359 
an essentially generate

551
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:44,039 
an impulse train where we

552
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,390 
chooses values for the impulses to pie

553
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,710 
times the forty a series coefficients

554
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:56,650 
so before a series coefficients array0
sequel to zero in a one is equal to 1

555
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,819 
so noticed that in

556
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:05,299 
the plot that I shown here above the 40
a transform

557
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:11,140 
love x1 a band we have the zeroth
coefficient which happens to be 0

558
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,829 
and so I haven't indicated impose

559
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,480 
there we have the

560
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,289 
coefficient a one and the coefficient a1

561
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,799 
occurs at a frequency which is

562
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:29,609 
Omega 0 and Omega 0 in fact is equal to
hi

563
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:33,089 
because the signal is the the j-pop I N

564
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:37,740 
well in what's this impulse over here

565
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,140 
well any polls is ace

566
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,470 
corresponds to the four-day series go
fishin a sieve -1

567
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,569 
and of course if we drew this out

568
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:52,470 
over a longer frequency axis we would
see lots of other impulses

569
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,890 
because it the fact that the four th
transform periodically repeats

570
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,390 
or equipment leader for a series
coefficients periodically

571
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,549 
p so this is the coefficient

572
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:07,500 
80 this is the coefficient

573
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,180 
a one with a factor to pie this is 25
times a zero

574
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,690 
and two pi times they won

575
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,839 
and then this is simply an indication

576
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,220 
that is periodically repeated

577
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,839 
right now let's consider what happens if
we take a signal

578
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,400 
and multiplier modulated by

579
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,460 
-1 to the end well in the frequency
domain

580
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,779 
that corresponds to a convolution

581
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:42,880 
let's consider a signal x2 a van

582
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,309 
which has a $4 EA transform as i've
indicated here

583
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:51,190 
then the Fourier transform the product

584
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,839 
affects 1 event next to %uh van is the
convolution

585
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,000 
up these two spectra and

586
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,599 
recall that if you can fall something

587
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,259 
with an impulse train is this is that
simply corresponds to taking the

588
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:07,609 
something

589
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:10,940 
and placing it at the positions love

590
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,119 
should the impulses so in fact

591
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,750 
the result the convolution this with
this

592
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,450 
would then be the spectrum their I
indicate here

593
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,509 
namely this spectrum shifted up to pie

594
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:29,529 
and of course two-minus by and then

595
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:33,460 
of course to not only Piper three pie in
five

596
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,990 
by et cetera et cetera and

597
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,109 
so this spectrum finally corresponds to

598
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,930 
the Fourier transform -1 to the end

599
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,740 
times X to have an where x2 event is the
sequence

600
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,769 
spectrum was x2 make

601
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,180 
okay now this is in fact important

602
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,339 
useful and interesting point what it
says is

603
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:04,160 
I have a signal with a certain spectrum
and if I

604
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,529 
modulate multiply that signaled by -1 to
the end

605
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:11,950 
meeting that I alternate the signs then

606
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:17,150 
it takes the low frequencies in effect
the ship's the spectrum by pie

607
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,720 
so it takes the low frequencies and
moves them up the high frequencies

608
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,000 
and will incidently take the high
frequencies and movement the low

609
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,460 
frequency

610
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,569 
so in fact we in essence saw this when
we

611
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:33,089 
so or twenty talked about the example
love

612
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,099 
a sequence which was aided the end times
you have an

613
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:40,059 
notice let me draw your attention to the
fact dead

614
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:43,240 
when a is positive we have

615
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,000 
this sequence and its Fourier transform

616
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,210 
is as II show on the right

617
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,430 
for a negative

618
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,440 
the sequence is

619
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,039 
the identical to a positive but with
alternating signs

620
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,579 
and the Fourier transform it that you
can now see

621
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:10,000 
and verify also algebraically

622
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,269 
if you'd like is identical to this
spectrum

623
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:17,670 
simply shifted by pie

624
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,690 
so it says in fact that multiplying

625
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,130 
that impulse response or if we think
I've a positive and a negative

626
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,730 
that is algebraically similar to
multiplying

627
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:34,069 
the impulse response by -1 to the end
and in the frequency domain

628
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:38,529 
the affected that essentially is
shifting the spectrum by pie

629
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:43,049 
we can interpret that in the context
that the modulation property

630
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,230 
now it's interesting that

631
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,240 
what that says is there

632
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,380 
if we have system which corresponds to

633
00:40:54,380 --> 00:41:00,119 
a low-pass filter as i indicated here

634
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,319 
with an impulse response a true fan

635
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,119 
and its it can be any approximation to a
low pass filter and even an idea Lopez

636
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,869 
filter

637
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:14,249 
if we want to convert that to a high
pass filter

638
00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:18,519 
we can't do that by generating a new
system

639
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:22,249 
whose impulse response is -1 to the end

640
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:25,450 
times the impulse response the low-pass
filter

641
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,999 
and this modulation

642
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:33,150 
by -1 to the end will take the frequency
response

643
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,749 
this system and shifted by popeye

644
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:39,749 
so that what's going on here at low
frequencies

645
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:44,599 
will now go on here at high frequency

646
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,789 
this also says incidently dead if

647
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,529 
we look at

648
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:57,150 
the a and idea low-pass filter and i do.
high pass filter

649
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,339 
and we choose the cutoff frequencies for
comparison

650
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:04,650 
for the band with the filter to be equal

651
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,220 
since this ideal high pass filter is

652
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,630 
this idea low-pass filter with the
frequency response shifted

653
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,559 
by popeye the modulation property tells
us

654
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,660 
that in the time domain with that
corresponds to

655
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,960 
is an impulse response multiplied five
minus one to the S

656
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,150 
so it says that the impulse response

657
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,559 
love the high-pass filter or quently the
inverse Fourier transform

658
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,609 
love a high pass filter frequency
response

659
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:41,819 
is -1 to the end times the

660
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:45,450 
impulse response to the low-pass filter
that all follows for the modulation

661
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,859 
property

662
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:51,700 
now there's another way interesting and
useful way

663
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,630 
that modulation can be used to

664
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,619 
implement or convert from low pass
filtering the high-pass filtering

665
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,099 
the modulation property tells us about
multiplying the time domain is shifting

666
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,170 
in the frequency domain

667
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,779 
and the example that we happen to pick
said if you multiply

668
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:15,410 
or modulate by -1 to the end that takes
low frequencies and ship them to

669
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,660 
high-frequency

670
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,920 
what that tells us it as a practical and
useful

671
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,440 
notion is the following suppose we have
a system

672
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,430 
that we know is a low pass filter and
it's a good luck this

673
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,859 
how might we use it as a high pass
filter

674
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:39,690 
well one way to do it instead of
shifting its frequency response

675
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,970 
is to take the original signal

676
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,730 
shift its low frequencies the high
frequencies and its high frequencies the

677
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,089 
low frequencies

678
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:53,609 
by multiplying the input signal the
original signal by -1 to the yen

679
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,269 
process that with the low-pass filter
we're now with sitting at the low

680
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:00,440 
frequencies with a high frequencies

681
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,450 
and then unscramble it all at the output

682
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,759 
so that we put the frequencies back
where they belong

683
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,380 
and I summarize that here let's suppose
for example that

684
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,460 
this system was a low-pass filter in and

685
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,130 
so it low pass filters whatever comes
into it

686
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,940 
down below I indicate taking the input
and first interchanging

687
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:32,430 
the high and low frequencies through
modulation with -1 to the end

688
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,099 
doing a low-pass filtering which and
what sitting at the low frequencies here

689
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,339 
with a high frequencies

690
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:42,319 
this signal and then after the low-pass
filtering

691
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,329 
moving the frequencies back where they
belong

692
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:48,569 
by again modulating with -1 to the end

693
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:52,339 
and that in fact turns out to be a very
useful

694
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:56,119 
a very useful notion for

695
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:00,430 
applying a fixed low pass filter

696
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:06,730 
to do high-pass filtering and vice versa

697
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,210 
okay no

698
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,559 
what we've seen and what we've talked
about

699
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,450 
are the for a representation for

700
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,029 
discrete-time signals and prior to that

701
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:27,220 
continuous-time say and we've seen some
very important similarities and

702
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,480 
differences

703
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,089 
and what I'd like to do is conclude

704
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:36,730 
this lecture by summarizing

705
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,220 
those various relationships kinda ball
in one package

706
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,309 
and in fact drawing your attention to

707
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:48,849 
both the similarities and differences
and comparisons between

708
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,420 
well let's begin in this summary

709
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,630 
by first looking at the continuous-time

710
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,130 
for a series in a continuous time for a
series

711
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,829 
we have a periodic time function

712
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:08,539 
expanded as a linear combination of
harmonically related complex

713
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:09,970 
exponentials

714
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,329 
and there are an infinite number these
that are required to do the

715
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:15,710 
decomposition

716
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,980 
and we saw and analysis equation which
tells us

717
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,740 
how to get these four EA series
coefficients

718
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,329 
through an integration on the original
time

719
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:31,380 
and notice in this that what we have

720
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,559 
is a continuous periodic timer function
what we end up with

721
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,069 
are in the frequency domain is a
sequence a Fourier series coefficients

722
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:41,839 
which in fact

723
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,549 
is an infinite sequence namely requires
all values

724
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:49,410 
K in general

725
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,960 
we had then generalized that to the
continuous time for EA transform

726
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,819 
an ineffective doing that what happened
is that

727
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:03,910 
the synthesis equation in the four EA

728
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,119 
series became

729
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,749 
integral relationship in the Fourier
transform

730
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:15,910 
and we now have a continuous-time

731
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:21,279 
function which is no longer periodic
this was for the a periodic case

732
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:27,019 
represented as a linear combination up
infinite has only close and frequency

733
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:32,499 
complex exponentials with complex
amplitudes given by Eq civil make it the

734
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:35,890 
Omega divided by two pi

735
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:41,059 
and we had of course the corresponding
analysis equation the told us how to get

736
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,079 
exe below me here

737
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,069 
we have a continuous-time function which
is a periodic

738
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:52,369 
and a continuous function of frequency

739
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,999 
which is a periodic

740
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,200 
the conceptual strategy in a
discrete-time case

741
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,589 
was very similar with

742
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:07,769 
so differences resulting in the

743
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:11,369 
relationships because of some inherent
differences between

744
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:15,089 
continuous-time and discrete-time we had

745
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:19,579 
we began with the discrete-time for you
series

746
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:24,039 
corresponding to representing a periodic
sequence

747
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,400 
through a set of complex exponentials

748
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,069 
where now we only required a finite
number of the

749
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:35,720 
is because the fact that in fact with
there are only a finite number of

750
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,519 
harmonically related complex
exponentials

751
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,980 
that's an inherent property
discrete-time complex exponentials

752
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,720 
and so we have a discrete

753
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,140 
periodic type function and we ended up
with a set of 48 series coefficients

754
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,549 
which of course are discrete as for a
series coefficients are

755
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:01,970 
and which periodically repeat because it
the fact

756
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,029 
that the Associated complex exponentials
periodically

757
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:08,519 
repeat we then

758
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,710 
used in arguments similar to the
continuous-time case

759
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,170 
for going for periodic time fortunes a
periodic time

760
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,289 
functions and we ended up with a
relationship

761
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,049 
describing representation for a periodic

762
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:26,390 
discrete-time signals in which now

763
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,410 
the synthesis equation went from a
summation to an integration

764
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,259 
says the frequencies are now if it
hasn't we close

765
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:39,019 
involving frequencies only over to pry
interval

766
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,809 
and for which the amplitude factor Xa
bomb-maker

767
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:47,200 
well the apathy factors X will make it
the Omega divided by two pi

768
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,299 
and this term Mexico may go which is the
48 transform

769
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:56,089 
is given by this some Asian

770
00:49:56,089 --> 00:50:01,519 
and course involves all of the values
affects a bit

771
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,880 
and so the important difference between
the continuous-time and discrete-time

772
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,890 
case kinda rose in part to the fact that
discrete I miss discrete-time

773
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,920 
continuous-time is continuous time

774
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,890 
and the fact the complex exponentials a
periodic

775
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,440 
in discrete-time the harmonically
related ones periodically repeat

776
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,450 
whereas they don't in continuous time

777
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:30,210 
now this among other things has an
important consequence for duality

778
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:34,359 
and let's go back again and look at this
equation

779
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:37,390 
despair equations clearly their

780
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,029 
is no duality between these two
equations

781
00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:44,230 
this involves a summation this involves
an integration

782
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,239 
and so in fact if

783
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:50,549 
we make reference to to our the

784
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,670 
their isn't the reality in the
continuous-time

785
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,759 
for a series however

786
00:50:56,759 --> 00:51:01,009 
for the continuous-time for EA transform

787
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:05,039 
we're talking about a periodic timer
functions in a periodic frequency

788
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,319 
functions

789
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,549 
and in fact we look at these two
equations we see very definitely duality

790
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:15,220 
in other words the time function
effectively

791
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,309 
is the Fourier transform the four th
transport

792
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:21,789 
little time reversal in there but
basically that's the result

793
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:26,529 
and in fact we had exploited that
duality property

794
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:32,029 
when we talked about the continuous-time
for EA transport

795
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:36,739 
with the discrete-time Fourier series

796
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,359 
we have a duality

797
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:44,609 
indicated by the fact that we have a
periodic time function

798
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:47,970 
and a sequence which is

799
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,489 
periodic in the frequency domain and in
fact if you look at these two

800
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:52,769 
expressions

801
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:56,529 
you see the duality very clearly and so

802
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:59,700 
ants the discrete-time Fourier series

803
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,749 
that has to do our D and

804
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:08,230 
finally the discrete-time Fourier
transform loses the duality

805
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:12,650 
because the fact among other things then
in the time domain

806
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,690 
things are inherently discrete whereas
in the frequency domain

807
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,630 
they are inherently continuous so in
fact here

808
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,680 
there is no do well

809
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,279 
okay now that says that there's a
difference in the duality

810
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:33,769 
continuous-time and discrete-time and
there's one

811
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:37,200 
more very important peace to

812
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,130 
the duality relationship and we can see
that

813
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,299 
first algebraically by comparing

814
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:47,739 
the continuous-time for a series

815
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:54,249 
and the discrete-time for EA transport

816
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:57,910 
the continuous time for a series

817
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:01,829 
in the time domain is a periodic
continuous function

818
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:06,940 
in the frequency domain is in a periodic
sequence

819
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,420 
in the discrete-time case in

820
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,509 
the time-domain we have

821
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:16,519 
and a periodic sequence

822
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:21,960 
and in the frequency domain we have a
function as a continuous variable

823
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,079 
which we know is periodic and so in fact

824
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,369 
we have in the time domain here a
periodic sequence

825
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:34,999 
in the frequency domain we have to
continue with periodic function

826
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:39,599 
and in fact if you look at the
relationship between these two

827
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,950 
and and what we see in fact is

828
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:47,440 
a duality between

829
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,079 
the continuous-time for EA series

830
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,400 
and the discrete-time for EA transport

831
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,819 
one way of thinking if that is to kind
of think

832
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,539 
this is a little bit at a time twister
which you might want to get straightened

833
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:04,059 
out

834
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:07,569 
slowly but

835
00:54:07,569 --> 00:54:12,279 
the Fourier transform a discrete-time is
a periodic function of frequency

836
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:17,210 
that periodic function has a forty a
series representation

837
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,140 
what is this for you series what are the
for a series coefficients

838
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,809 
that periodic function well in fact
except for an issue with time reversal

839
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,049 
what it is

840
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:31,640 
is the original sequence for which
that's the 48 Reitz

841
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,400 
and that is the duality that I'm trying
to emphasize

842
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,579 
you

843
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,220 
okay well so what we see is that these

844
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:47,170 
four sets a relationship all tied
together in a whole variety of ways

845
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:51,079 
and we will be exploiting as the
discussion goes on the

846
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,970 
interconnections a relationship that
i've talked about

847
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:59,569 
also as we've talked about the 48
transform both continuous-time and

848
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:01,190 
discrete-time

849
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,660 
two important properties that we focus
on among

850
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,910 
many other properties by the convolution
property in the modulation property

851
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,299 
we've also shown that the convolution
property

852
00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:17,539 
the so very important concept

853
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:21,220 
namely filtering the modulation property
leads to an

854
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,390 
an important con- concept namely
modulation

855
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,700 
we've also very briefly indicated

856
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,200 
that how these properties

857
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,930 
and how these concepts have practical
implications

858
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,039 
in the next several lectures will focus
and more specifically

859
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,579 
first on filtering and then on
modulation

860
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:48,180 
and as we'll see the filtering and
modulation concept

861
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,749 
form really the cornerstone %uh many
many

862
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:53,779 
signal processing ideas thank you
