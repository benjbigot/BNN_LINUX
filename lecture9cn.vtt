00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
is dead we've lost edges which

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
is the rapid variation and what we've retained is the broader

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and we can also consider is what would happen if we look

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this

to be enhanced if in fact we differentiated the image
