the in

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,790 
the new the we concluded the last
lecture

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,690 
with the statement above the sampling
theorem and just as a quick reminder

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,089 
the sampling theorem said that

13
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,270 
if we have a continuous-time signal

14
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,700 
and we have equally spaced samples

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,460 
all that signal sampled at a sampling
period which a indicators capital T

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,869 
and if except he is banned limited

17
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,550 
in other words the forty a transformer 0

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,830 
outside some band where Omega Sapan

19
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,110 
is the highest frequency then

20
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,590 
under the condition that the sampling
frequency which is two-part divided by

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,539 
the period

22
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,170 
is greater than twice the highest
frequency

23
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,080 
the original signal is uniquely

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,950 
recoverable from the set of samples and

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,549 
the sampling theorem essentially was
derived by

26
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,820 
observing or using the notion that

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,119 
sampling could be done by multiplication

28
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,729 
or modulation with an impulse train and
the sampling theorem develop

29
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,860 
by examining the consequence

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,280 
love the modulation property in the
context of the Fourier transform

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,040 
in particular if we have our signal
accept T

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,430 
and it's multiplied by an impulse train

33
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,560 
to give us a sampled signal

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,480 
another impose train whose values or
areas are samples of the original time

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,170 
function

36
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,049 
as i indicate here then

37
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,930 
in fact if we examine this equation or
equivalently

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,989 
bringing accept T inside this some

39
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,500 
if we examine either if these equations
in the frequency domain

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,760 
the four EA transform love

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,520 
exe PFT is the convolution

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,290 
above the 40 a transformer the original
signal and the Fourier transform

43
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,129 
up the impulse train now

44
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,890 
be imposed strain is a periodic signal
its Fourier transform

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,870 
therefore as we talked about with
Fourier transforms itself an impulse

46
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,580 
train

47
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,700 
and when we do this convolution n

48
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,030 
using the fact that the 48 race for the
imposed strain

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,280 
is an impulse train the result

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,090 
or this convolution then tells us

51
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,370 
that the 48 transform love

52
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,550 
the sampled signal or the impulse train

53
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,459 
which represents the samples is a some

54
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,319 
love frequency shifted replications

55
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,390 
up the 48 transform of the original
signal

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,840 
so mathematically

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,420 
that's the relationship it essentially
says that after sampling or modulation

58
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,879 
with an impulse train

59
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,069 
the resulting spectrum is the original
spectrum

60
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,420 
added to itself shifted by multiples

61
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,080 
integer multiples of the sampling
frequency well

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,569 
let's see that as we did last time in
terms of pictures

63
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,140 
and again to remind you of the basic

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,269 
picture involved if we have an original
signal

65
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,440 
with the spectrum is a indicated here
where

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,789 
its ban limited with the highest
frequency Omega Savannah M

67
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,390 
and if the time function is sample

68
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,870 
so that in the frequency domain week
involved this spectrum

69
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,870 
with the spectrum shown below which is
the

70
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,300 
spectrum love the impulse train

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,320 
the convolution if these true up these
two

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,870 
is then the Fourier transform or
spectrum

73
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,590 
love the sampled time function

74
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,740 
and so thats what we end up with here

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,669 
and then as you recall to recover the
original time function

76
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,400 
from this as long as these individual
triangles don't overlap

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,800 
to recover it just simply involves

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800 
passing the impulse train through a
low-pass filter in effect

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,970 
extracting just one of these
replications

80
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,440 
love the original spectrum

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360 
so the overall system

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,930 
then for for doing the sampling and then

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,520 
the reconstruction of the original
signal from the samples

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,400 
consists of multiplying the original
time function

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,370 
by an impulse train and that gives us

86
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,990 
then the sampled signal

87
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,400 
the Fourier transform I show here love
the

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,780 
original signal and after modulation
with the impulse train

89
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,300 
the resulting spectrum that we have is

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,479 
that replicated around integer multiples
of the sampling frequency

91
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,479 
and then finally to recover

92
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,100 
the original signal or to generate a
reconstructed signal

93
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,710 
we then multiply this in the frequency
domain

94
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,699 
by the frequency response of an idea
low-pass filter

95
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,880 
and what that accomplishes forest and

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,259 
is recovering the original signal

97
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,820 
now in this picture an important point
that I raise last time

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,880 
relates to the fact dead in doing the
reconstruction

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,410 
well we've assumed is dead in
replicating

100
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,660 
these individual versions

101
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,060 
0 the original signal

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,979 
those replications don't overlap and
sold by passing this through a low-pass

103
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,190 
filter in fact

104
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,479 
we can recover the original signal well

105
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,009 
what that requires is that

106
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,430 
this frequency Omega Savannah M be less
than

107
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,169 
this frequency and this frequency

108
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,310 
is Omega so fast minus Omega serve them

109
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,690 
and so what we require is dead the
frequency Omega Sapan

110
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,590 
be less than Omega cyb s minus Omega sed
am

111
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,919 
or equivalent Lee what we require is
that the sampling frequency

112
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,330 
be greater and twice the highest
frequency

113
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,690 
in the original signal now

114
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,030 
if in fact that condition is violated

115
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,960 
then we end up with a very important
effect

116
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,819 
and that effect is referred to as a
leasing

117
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,430 
in particular if we look back at are

118
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,889 
original example we're here

119
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,580 
we were able to recover our original
spectrum by

120
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,080 
low-pass filtering if in fact

121
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,650 
the sampling frequency is

122
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,930 
not high enough to avoid aliasing

123
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,639 
then what happens in that case is that
the individual replications

124
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,910 
love the Fourier transform above the
stove the original signal

125
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,960 
overlap and what we end up with

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,800 
is some distortion as you can see if we
tried to pass this through a low-pass

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,330 
filter

128
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,449 
to recover the original signal in fact
we won't recover the original signal

129
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:38,360 
since these individual replications have
overlapped

130
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,400 
and this is the case where Omega service
minus Omega Savannah is less than

131
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,940 
Omega so vast in other words the
sampling frequency is not greater

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,120 
in this case than twice the highest
frequency

133
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,970 
so what happens here then is that in
effect

134
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,500 
higher frequencies get folded down into
lower frequencies what would come out of

135
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,130 
the low-pass filter

136
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,390 
is the reflection of some higher
frequencies into lower frequencies

137
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,839 
as I suggested a minute ago that affect

138
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,790 
is referred to as alias saying and in
order to

139
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,010 
both understand that term better and two
understand in fact the effect better

140
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,279 
it's useful to examine this a little
more closely

141
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,760 
for the specific example a sinusoidal
signal

142
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,459 
so let's concentrate on that and what we
want to look at

143
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,500 
is the effect or alias saying

144
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,890 
when our input signal is a sinusoidal
signal

145
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,339 
now to do that what I wanna show shortly

146
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,480 
is a computer-generated movie

147
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,860 
that we've made and let's first
walk-through

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,890 
a few frames a bit to give you our first
of all

149
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,490 
to to set up our notation and to suggest
what it is that we're trying to

150
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,550 
demonstrate

151
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,050 
well what we have is an input signal

152
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,080 
is a sinusoidal signal and

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,459 
the spectrum or for a transformer that

154
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,560 
is an impulse in the frequency domain at

155
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,779 
the frequency the sinusoid we then

156
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,200 
have samples love that and when we
sample that in for this particular

157
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,080 
example its sample the 10 killer hurts

158
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,910 
this spectrum is then replicated

159
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,649 
at multiples all the sampling frequency

160
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,850 
and I haven't shown negative frequencies
here but the contribution do

161
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,130 
to the negative frequency

162
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,670 
is at 10 killer hurts minus the input
sinusoid

163
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,790 
we then carry out a reconstruction

164
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,149 
with an idea low-pass filter and the
ideal ok pass filter is set at

165
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,450 
half the sampling frequency or five
kelleher its

166
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,490 
so what we have then is

167
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,990 
the input signal accept T

168
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,850 
and the impulse train exe PFT

169
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,149 
and then the reconstructed signal is

170
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:16,399 
the output from the low-pass filter

171
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,100 
which I denote as X a party

172
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,149 
now as the input frequency X 50

173
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,279 
increases this impulse moves up in
frequency

174
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,130 
but this impulse moves down in frequency

175
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,180 
and so let's just look at a few frames
as the input frequency increases

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,579 
so we have here a case

177
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,680 
where the input frequency has move up

178
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,730 
close to five killer hurts

179
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,790 
as we continue further these two
impossible's

180
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,630 
will cross and what we'll end up with as
i indicated

181
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,310 
is aliasing so here now is a case

182
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,610 
where we have alias saying the

183
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,970 
replication of the negative frequency
has crossed into the passband if the

184
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,100 
filter

185
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,990 
and the reconstructed sinusoid will now

186
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,829 
be the frequency associated with this
impulse

187
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,990 
rather than the frequency Associated

188
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,620 
with the original sinusoid and to
dramatize that

189
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,870 
even further here is

190
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,820 
the example where now the input
frequency

191
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,029 
has moved up close to 10 killer hurts

192
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,110 
but what comes out of the low-pass
filter

193
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,570 
is a much lower frequency and in fact

194
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,519 
you can see that here is the
reconstructed sinusoid

195
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,839 
whereas here we have the input size

196
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,959 
okay well now what I'm gonna wanna do is

197
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,920 
demonstrate this as i indicated with a
computer-generated movie

198
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,709 
and well we'll see is the effect

199
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:05,149 
on the effect of reconstructing

200
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:08,160 
from the samples using a low-pass filter

201
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,360 
for an input which changes in frequency

202
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,720 
and with the sampling rate of 10 killer
hurts

203
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,060 
and what we'll see in the first part of
this movie is

204
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,740 
the input except the and the
reconstructed signal

205
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,240 
X a party without explicitly showing the
samples

206
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,089 
and then at a later point will also show
this and indicate

207
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,490 
that in fact the samples are those two
are equal even though

208
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,560 
they themselves are not

209
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,899 
so at the top will have the input
sinusoid without

210
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,930 
showing the samples and its

211
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,510 
for EA transform is an impulse in the
frequency domain as we've indicated

212
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,680 
and if we sample it that imposed and
gets replicated

213
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,860 
and so samples in particular

214
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,329 
will have a Fourier transform not only
with an impulse

215
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:07,240 
at the input sinusoid sinusoidal
frequency but also attend killer hurts

216
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,230 
minus that frequency

217
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,550 
now for the reconstruction we pass the
samples through an idea low-pass filter

218
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,370 
I picked

219
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,360 
the cutoff frequency of the low-pass
filter at half the sampling frequency

220
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,540 
namely 5 killer hurts

221
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,649 
and here we see is that the output

222
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,529 
reconstructed signal in fact matches in
frequency the input signal

223
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,260 
now as we change the input frequency

224
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,959 
the reconstructed sinus so it is
identical

225
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,010 
until we get to an input frequency

226
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,470 
which exceeds half the sampling
frequency

227
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,139 
at that point we have aliasing and while
the input frequency is increasing

228
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,730 
the output frequency in fact is
decreasing

229
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,940 
because that's what's inside the
passband the filter

230
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:05,050 
now let's sweep it back and as the input
frequency decreases the output frequency

231
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,190 
increases

232
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,930 
till there's no aliasing and now the
output reconstructed

233
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,320 
signal is equal to the input

234
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,190 
so we sample the signal and then
reconstructed

235
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,949 
the signal from the samples and keep in
mind

236
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:26,670 
that given a set of samples there are
lots of continuous curves that we can

237
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,639 
thread through the set of samples

238
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,660 
the one that we picked up cores is the
one consistent

239
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,899 
with the assumption about the signal
band with

240
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,000 
in particular we've reconstructed the
signal

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,420 
that who spectrum falls within the pass
band at the filter

242
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,389 
now what I'd like to show is the same

243
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,570 
reconstruction and input as I showed
before

244
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,110 
but now let's look at the samples and
what we'll see is that

245
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,579 
when there's alias saying even though

246
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,029 
the output the reconstructed signal

247
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,680 
is not identical to the input in fact

248
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,820 
it's consistent with the input samples
that is sampling the reconstructed

249
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,579 
signal

250
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,139 
gives a set of samples identical to the
samples at the input

251
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,209 
and it's just that the interpolation in
between those samples

252
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,300 
is an interpolation consistent with you
soon

253
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,940 
fan with love the input based on the
sampling there

254
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,949 
so let's now look at that with

255
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:33,709 
the samples also shown along with the
sinusoid

256
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,470 
so at the top we have the input sinusoid
together with its samples

257
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,850 
the bottom traces the Fourier transform
of the sampled waveform

258
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,430 
the middle trace is the reconstructed

259
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,540 
sinusoid together with its samples and
notice of course that the samples are

260
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,639 
the input a reconstructed signal

261
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,920 
are identical and also

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,440 
the input sinusoidal frequency

263
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,959 
and the output sinus or frequency are
identical

264
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,409 
we now increase the frequency at the
input

265
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,159 
the reconstructed sinusoid tracks the
input frequency

266
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:16,970 
and of course the samples are the two
are identical

267
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,800 
the interpolation in between the samples
is identical

268
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,829 
because the fact dead the input
frequency is still

269
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:31,510 
less than half the sampling frequency

270
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,149 
and so as long as the input is frequency
is less than half the sampling frequency

271
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:40,690 
not only will the samples be identical
but also

272
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,220 
the reconstructed continuous waveform
will match

273
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:51,220 
the input way for

274
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,940 
now when we get to hear the sampling
frequency were just

275
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,970 
on the verge Bailey is saying this isn't
alias saying

276
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,610 
quite yet but any increase in the input
frequency

277
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,250 
will now generate aliasing we now have a
leasing

278
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,429 
the output frequency is lower than the
input frequency but notice

279
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,200 
that the samples are identical now

280
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,240 
the low-pass filter is interpolating in
between those samples

281
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,970 
with a sinusoid that falls within the
past Pandev the low-pass filter

282
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,550 
which no longer matches the frequency of
the input sinusoid but

283
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,410 
the important point is that even when we
have alias saying

284
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,740 
the samples are the reconstructed
waveform

285
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,840 
are identical to the samples

286
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,540 
of the original way for and notice that
as the input frequency increases

287
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,770 
in fact the interpolated output the
reconstructed output

288
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:01,770 
has decreased in frequency now as the
input frequency begins to get closer to

289
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,250 
10 killer hurts in fact you're all I

290
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,380 
tends to also interpolate between the
samples

291
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,250 
with a frequency that is lower

292
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,340 
day and the input frequency NS
particularly evident

293
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,170 
here notice that the input samples in
fact

294
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,220 
look like they would be associated

295
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,030 
with a much lower frequency sinusoid
then in fact

296
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,350 
was the sinusoid the generated a lower
frequency sinusoid

297
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,679 
in fact corresponds to the reconstructed
one now as we sit back down

298
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,760 
the aliasing eventually disappears and
the output sinus or tracks the input

299
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,070 
sinusoid in frequency

300
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,800 
so we've seen the

301
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,830 
effective aliasing for sinusoidal
signals and turns away forms

302
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,710 
now let's hear how it sounds now

303
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,210 
what we have for this demonstration is

304
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,530 
an oscillator and

305
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,410 
a sampler and the output of the sampler

306
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,850 
goes into a low-pass filter so the

307
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,130 
input for from the oscillator goes into
the sampler

308
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,140 
and the output the sampler

309
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,600 
goes into the low-pass filter the

310
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,809 
sampler frequency is 10 killer hurts

311
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:26,240 
and so the low-pass filter

312
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,150 
has a cutoff frequency as i indicate
here

313
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,580 
all five killer hurts and

314
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,600 
what will listened to is the

315
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,280 
reconstructed output as the

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,960 
oscillator input frequency berries

317
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,130 
and recall there what should happen is
that

318
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,309 
when the oscillator input frequency gets
past half the sampling frequency

319
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:59,230 
we should hear aliasing so we'll start
the oscillator it to kill her ex

320
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,460 
and keep in mind that what you see on
the dial

321
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,860 
is the input frequency which you here is
the output frequency

322
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,530 
as long as the input frequency is less
than half the sampling frequency in

323
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,130 
other words 5 killer hurts

324
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,000 
the reconstructed signal sounds
identical to the input

325
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,510 
now at five still hurts were right

326
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,600 
on the verge of aliasing and when we
increase the input frequency past five

327
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,480 
killer hurts

328
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,030 
the reconstructed frequency in fact will
decrease

329
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,880 
so as we move for example from 5 killer
hurts

330
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,070 
up to let's say 6 killer hurts

331
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,110 
sick still hurts in fact yes alias

332
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,070 
down to what gets alias down to

333
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,330 
4 killer us so

334
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,250 
6 go over to the input is for killer
hurts

335
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,180 
at the output now if we move up even
further

336
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,140 
7 kilohertz at the end pushed its alias
down

337
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,800 
to three killer hurts at the outpost

338
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,220 
so bad dan is a audio demonstration and
aliasing

339
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,340 
so to summarize

340
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,690 
if we sample signal and then reconstruct

341
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,420 
from the samples using a low-pass filter
as long as the sampling frequency is

342
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,150 
greater than twice the highest frequency
in the signal

343
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,610 
we reconstruct exactly if on the other
hand

344
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,010 
the sampling frequency is too low less
than twice the highest frequency

345
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,260 
then we get alias saying in other words

346
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,150 
higher frequencies get folded or
reflected

347
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,460 
down into lower frequencies as they come
through the low-pass filter

348
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,120 
now wanted the

349
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,260 
common applications love the whole
concept of sampling

350
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,380 
is the use sampling to convert a
continuous-time signal into a

351
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,520 
discrete-time signal to carry out

352
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,340 
what's often referred to as discreet I
processing

353
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,420 
of continuous-time signals and this in
fact is something that will be talking

354
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,080 
about

355
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,560 
in a fair amount of detail beginning
with the next lecture

356
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,180 
but and let me indicate that for

357
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,760 
that kinda processing essentially what
happens

358
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,370 
is dead we begin with a continuous-time
signal

359
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,710 
and convert it to a discrete-time signal

360
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,350 
carry out the discrete-time processing
and then

361
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,910 
convert back to continuous-time and

362
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,660 
the conversion from a continuous-time
signal to a discrete-time

363
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,670 
signal in fact is done

364
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,660 
by exploiting sampling specifically

365
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,910 
by sampling the continuous-time signal

366
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,100 
with an impulse train and then

367
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,590 
converting the impulse train into

368
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,040 
a sequence in a manner that all talk
about in more detail

369
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,340 
next time now in doing that

370
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,420 
of course as you can imagine it's
important since we want

371
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,460 
an accurate representation of the
original continuous-time signal

372
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,080 
to choose the sampling frequency to very
carefully avoid aliasing

373
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,640 
and so in fact in that context

374
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,030 
and in many other contexts alias saying
is something

375
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,380 
that we're very eager to avoid however

376
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,700 
it's also important to understand that
alias saying

377
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,570 
isn't all bad and there are some very
specific contexts in which

378
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,960 
alias saying is very useful and very
heavily exploited

379
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,130 
one example love

380
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,280 
a very useful context valia saying is
when

381
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,590 
you want to look at things that happen
at frequencies

382
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,210 
that you can't look at for one reason or
another and sampling in a leasing is

383
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,650 
used to map those into lower frequencies

384
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,880 
one very common example of that is the
use of the stroboscopic

385
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,750 
which was invented by doctor how their
chechen

386
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,280 
at MIT and sometime earlier in fact we
had

387
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,100 
the opportunity to visit doctor Richard
ins laboratory at MIT

388
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,310 
and see some examples of this so I'd
like to

389
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,020 
at as a conclusion to this lecture take
you

390
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,850 
on visit to the stroke where and MIT

391
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,070 
in the lecture in discussing aliasing
we've stressed

392
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,940 
the fact that in most situations it's
something that would like to avoid

393
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,950 
however right now we're at MIT and
stroll Valley

394
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,960 
as it's called on the way to visit the
laboratory

395
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,030 
Mike MIT colleague Professor are alleged

396
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,440 
where in fact a leasing is an everyday
occurrence

397
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,320 
basically the idea is to follow dead

398
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,540 
it in fact you wanna make measurements

399
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,000 
at frequencies that for one reason or
another

400
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,480 
you can't measure their sampling and
consequently aliasing

401
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,230 
can be used to bring those frequencies
down into a frequency range that you can

402
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,220 
measure

403
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,390 
well professor edgerton alias

404
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,310 
da kitchen invented the strokes call

405
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,450 
for exactly that reason and kinda the
idea is the fall

406
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,050 
the I essentially is a low pass filter
and so there are things that happen

407
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,320 
at frequencies boat which

408
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,790 
your I contract and by

409
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,440 
sampling with light poles sampling in
time

410
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,050 
what in effect you're able to do is
sample in such a way

411
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,080 
that higher frequencies get alias

412
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,650 
down to lower frequencies then factor I
contract

413
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,420 
so let's take the look inside the where

414
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,950 
and in fact see no aspiration or

415
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:05,260 
the scroll and some its effects

416
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,010 
will be here introduce you to my mighty
colleague I kitchen

417
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,360 
in also by the way he this is a great
place for kids of all ages

418
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,380 
and so my daughter just insisted on
coming along to

419
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,720 
also helped out stock need you we could
begin with you

420
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,080 
just saying a little bit about what the
strobe is in with some history is

421
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,230 
steroids ring resemble an increase in a
min ly

422
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,970 
misses them losing on Lampson

423
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,770 
prices litter control rate planning on

424
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,420 
school is not a good strategy is going
to turn and we're going to look at.

425
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,650 
motor striving on balance weight

426
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,120 
to set up some rhinos lesions in the
spring

427
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,880 
want to know more bring on the throne

428
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,880 
by

429
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,960 
by

430
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,710 
you writer and

431
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,710 
throbs but just in the frequency the way

432
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:25,950 
but corresponds to North influencer
little more elusive

433
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,980 
for the facts thought maybe we could the
turn the stroller

434
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,789 
for a minute noon the but let me

435
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:37,600 
point out the by the way there the fact
that

436
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,570 
when looking at this without the strong
mind always say essentially

437
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,600 
our frequencies that are I can attract
so you can see the motor

438
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,269 
turning and

439
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,769 
we can really see other than then with
the were we can see the movie the spring

440
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:55,440 
and so I get your point is that when we
put the strobe on

441
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,779 
who were essentially sampling this and
no

442
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,330 
you brought this stand with a frequency
that there the

443
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,649 
Riza with the track in fact

444
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:09,960 
the I guess if we turn the

445
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,169 
incandescent light of loon

446
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,279 
the able to really bring out

447
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,399 
are the alias frequency so now we're
what we're looking at in fact are the

448
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,590 
the earliest frequencies the street
courses moving a lot faster than we see

449
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,359 
it in their ranks

450
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,609 
you know that's going on arena

451
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:34,070 
30 times second Bruins are

452
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,929 
thirties and second occurs through the
survivors include

453
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:41,859 
next move Rohingya figure 8a. saying you
don't see that

454
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:47,399 
yeah friend

455
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:54,399 
well we'll be seeing now is essentially
second harmonic that

456
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,059 
someone okay

457
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,080 
and just do you think you can make this
spring dance around a little bit

458
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,399 
find taking this slow frequency soon as
all around

459
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,909 
okay it's really neat let's turn the
lights back on

460
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:23,190 
weekend this is Charles president with
anything 3 I'm

461
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,029 
yeah has the third what's interesting
now if we look at this and

462
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,179 
seeking a fifth just rolled off again

463
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:37,039 
earth okay noticed just think we look at
the spring man although we can see is a

464
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,600 
blur

465
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,200 
and really can't see because you're
right here tracking

466
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,119 
can see things happening station but he
said

467
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,830 
by the way this was written demonstrated
at the World's Fair

468
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,400 
the thickness

469
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,399 
world because glasses

470
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,589 
for their Wow a loses all dressed up

471
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,679 
element using

472
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,690 
break bring bruises

473
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,889 
fine but failed I stick with the miners
stresses

474
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,219 
runners or have break

475
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,929 
bum they work on automobiles

476
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:24,929 
their own thoughts on the vibrate but
let's

477
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,659 
earth buy levitra run this for a lot
more than half an hour or a liberal

478
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:33,600 
name is continues

479
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,980 
terms

480
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,200 
thing me maybe we can look at the

481
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,279 
a couple other things have a about the
fam

482
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,940 
brand the classic buzzed

483
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,639 
that's a good idea makes too much noise

484
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,989 
ok is to remove that over here that's
just an ordinary like the fam

485
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:58,610 
has a mark on one plate surgeon

486
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:05,610 
identify you can get up to speed

487
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,190 
know that this looks like a phantom was
also demonstrated in the

488
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,870 
world's fair few years ago yeah kinda
been

489
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,470 
been does a movie

490
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,580 
quicken awake practicing in to and it
was very fan

491
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,070 
well one like it happened if the reform
do

492
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,120 
MGM and the Peters B Smith

493
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,680 
wanted he said he won miss royale up

494
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,500 
custard pie into it not don't know I'm a
serious scientists for

495
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,200 
sizes compromise on a I

496
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,400 
so we dropped an egg into it in the news
UCI's B-movie

497
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,180 
dropping 0 not known struggle there
there was with the

498
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,880 
high-speed great remove yeah it's okay
so

499
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,730 
so again I guess without this true when
we look at its

500
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,260 
what we're looking at our frequencies it
are

501
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,200 
much higher than the I think following
now with the stroke blindness

502
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,170 
you can see both the alias frequency and
you can also see the original frequency

503
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,030 
because we have the

504
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,530 
investment line sweats I'm let's

505
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,650 
turned down the the background lighting
and

506
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,050 
stand then really all that were able to
see or the aliasing

507
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,460 
frequencies stand I guess

508
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,510 
I guess when we see more than one market
means that the

509
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,960 
stay were actually running its and

510
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,310 
or guns is more and more things the the
using

511
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,080 
lower radiation steroids because the
plans aren't exactly the same

512
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,140 
actually this gives me a chance
illustrating other important correlated

513
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,070 
to the lecture

514
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,110 
I'll that they could bring them to
frequency

515
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:56,110 
so that re only get one more scorched

516
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,550 
missus begins to move this is just one
way there now

517
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,580 
okay so so the way we have now we've
essentially alias the fan speed and so

518
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,060 
the

519
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,110 
is just a little higher than the seeds
and now

520
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,820 
on right at the sea and now if I could
and just a little further in fact that

521
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,870 
looks like the fans turning back hurts

522
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,040 
and if you think that this into context
the leasing

523
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,820 
its it's like this to impulses in the
frequency domain

524
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,140 
crossover in with you get an effective
you and was mathematically

525
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,420 
you get a phase reversed in

526
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,740 
no wasn't so I E I first understood have
a leasing

527
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,310 
with Doc understood why stand with the
western movies

528
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,730 
a everyone's Ryan see the wagon wheels
through November go backwards train and

529
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,890 
there's there the

530
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,600 
wagon wheels in western movie going
backwards yes stressed

531
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,510 
and just see what you see is %um too
much weaker on straight up so you get to

532
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,670 
just see greater frequency of so that's

533
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,230 
you get to marched

534
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,030 
u-turn and Justin's governor and you
think tourist

535
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,080 
you impressed

536
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,870 
schoolroom its regular spirits

537
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,980 
all rights pictures in your honor older
adults

538
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,600 
and I rising price revolution I guess
another thing is that this demonstrates

539
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,620 
something that is

540
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,620 
and I heard a long time ago which is its
should never use a power so with the

541
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,410 
fluorescent lights the is arrest like is
a little bit of a stroke affecting

542
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,870 
you could actually can misuse of that
standing still make mistakes a

543
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,810 
strength that you think everything we
are doing is a good friend of

544
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,120 
no I don't think I want to try it out
how are you this do you think that's

545
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,550 
any sores and wounds she knows it's
going

546
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,800 
sproule undergoing closest friends okay
let's

547
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,570 
I'm actually we turn the lights back on
again what's

548
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,890 
their latest see once again is that we
can see both the alias frequencies going

549
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,960 
to you that's

550
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,400 
and we we can also see the higher
frequencies because the

551
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,530 
incandescent lighting its okay maybe we
can be no

552
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,620 
is parents take a look at some other

553
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,500 
on things and when I guess I'm curious
about is the distance you have over

554
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,410 
their kids

555
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,180 
doc maybe you can tell us what we have
here

556
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,300 
churros the this to show

557
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,240 
how you can get motion pictures on a
Susan still pictures

558
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,040 
the circle is repeated 12 times

559
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,860 
why does outer part over mmm on this
site

560
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,390 
in part on the other quiet place one
time for a revolution on this

561
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,880 
you see the exactly as it is if I skip
one picture each time

562
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,880 
when you get there relative motions

563
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,150 
mall the object is to show the ball
rotating

564
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,520 
is this where that one depending on mood
straw was going faster or slower

565
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,780 
and the other Uzan this way motion
pictures went well

566
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,970 
100 years school long for photography
drew pictures of people

567
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,850 
different animated features like the run
yes great

568
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:16,280 
is actually the title kinda busy
aliasing can be fun conservatism

569
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,460 
sterling if the speeds

570
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,190 
or away if you get a lot of different
things sorted veterans

571
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,890 
go through ruin currently reaches speeds

572
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,340 
reserve a room in the rules it sounds

573
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,650 
ok and the background blur basically the
high frequencies the I can't follow

574
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,690 
and and then we're going to propose and
then again we can see

575
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,030 
frequencies it really is down the nets

576
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,410 
rookie I ends right now I am one place
for revolution sleep

577
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,670 
see the corner the move is consuming
records

578
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,770 
exactly the reasons there are an
increasing frequency

579
00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,730 
of risk if 100 one server or early get
the illusion that diamonds

580
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,980 
room in fact let's a let's really
enhanced solution

581
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,120 
Western the incandescent lights off

582
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,830 
and now now are we seeing really you're
the alias frequencies

583
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,340 
or or do you think this just adds

584
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,020 
looks like reading recognized through
was doing rejoining licensing

585
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,820 
of is the same rules now lower watching
is something also

586
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,050 
might point out of a for the

587
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,580 
I'm the lecture for the course is that
actually there

588
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,820 
there really are two sampling
frequencies receiving one is this road

589
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,760 
and

590
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,500 
which is the stroke that you're running
the other is the inherent

591
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,400 
Creamery for the TV that's running at 30
frames a second

592
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,930 
and that's won the reasons by the way in
dead people watching this

593
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,670 
on the video worst are in fact seeing

594
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,930 
Flickr or a feeding or modulation
between

595
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,200 
the two on synchronize frame rates
runner grievances

596
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:06,960 
grow up so we get to of to a room
credits

597
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,990 
of to

598
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:16,990 
roaming two runs on each other of

599
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,230 
of

600
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,820 
you know it senator Reid's learning this

601
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,470 
soon living room when all your friends

602
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,340 
I think would be a good terrific homered
problem getting video Kors

603
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,810 
they have them all sit down and analyze
all the frequencies that they're seeing

604
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,109 
and what they're being alias through the
evening event

605
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:39,140 
it's a good view run the teacher I love
you

606
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,350 
who is great yeah remember these dudes
list

607
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,590 
I think that a chase a few people away
from the courses good

608
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:49,760 
cracks and you get you get involved in
these offerings

609
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,220 
rule ruler and what you can do for a KMS
roots

610
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,570 
let's bring you the incandescent lights
back again

611
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,260 
just to remind everybody that in back
row this or

612
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,730 
some some frequencies that are a lot
higher than the ones that

613
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,900 
we begin to get the impression that
we're watching just the

614
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,520 
motor running Frances Bean pattern on

615
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,420 
long Dhaka have to

616
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,480 
I have to say that there are many people
I know they have as much fun in the work

617
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,130 
as you do

618
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:23,230 
home like a man arm quote would but I'd
like to

619
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,490 
do now baby is take a look at one last
experiment sure did

620
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,750 
and what I'd like to do is a.m. is go
take a look at the

621
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,770 
I guess what sometimes is called the
home

622
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,270 
well not the water graphics for men with
thin air the minute dole pillar

623
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,590 
hydraulic everything that's the 1i was
thinking and let's take a look over

624
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,030 
there

625
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:49,030 
okay one just in this Go internal war so

626
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,670 
your doc this is the what did you got DP

627
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,560 
HHM bird double peddler hydraulic

628
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,010 
happening machine Gary okay then it's
a.m. so please

629
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,030 
it looks like continues dream up it is
not its

630
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,180 
pump over there something sixty post
second so those owners

631
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,900 
coming out in spurts %uh so actually
again it's

632
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,990 
it's the the sixty boss is the second
year I can follow

633
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,530 
your eyes so is exactly basically looks
like a blur

634
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,170 
ruseler it is a blur writers you learn
output stroll on

635
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:28,990 
okay grace start so again

636
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,410 
I guess we have this a essentially alias
then in

637
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,600 
and again with the incandescent light
you can see both sky high frequency

638
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,210 
and the alias frequency its and

639
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,720 
but see I guess that's with the
frequency close to the sea and we can

640
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,090 
adjusted so that is stop stop bothering
me going to go out and then we can

641
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,200 
actually make it go up

642
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,910 
scored anybody who is this South

643
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,340 
yeah effect movie have just just again
due to stress this point to the

644
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,590 
class the the kind of the idea here the
face reversal of course

645
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,980 
you can see it in the time domain
Chynoweth you just think about when the

646
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,990 
flashes of light

647
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,320 
come but if you think I love kind of
these

648
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,109 
impulses that we have in the frequency
domain

649
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:18,660 
and we're aliasing as we change the
sampling frequency what happens is that

650
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,580 
these impulses crossover

651
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,780 
and what that means is that we get a
phase reversal the pending

652
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,280 
on which faces are associated with

653
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,230 
which side up the sea so that's kind of
the idea the phase reversal

654
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,550 
okay let's the let's turn the

655
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,090 
against because it is important thing in
between those who got

656
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,510 
yeah let's let's turn the incandescent
light of first and

657
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,530 
think one thing your so 103 know through
this thing you think you can do to get

658
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,210 
on the other side you're on hand so we
can see with

659
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:54,220 
when for the UN intervening sleuths

660
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,230 
water there all the time well on a
nosedive it seems to me if we can't we

661
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,590 
just the justices

662
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:04,850 
the that's just go through to next year
staff the dots can do it just seeing how

663
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,550 
come you think your finger in the air

664
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,790 
fun to try once more its

665
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,450 
I get snyder et that's one thing we can
do this

666
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,720 
well as bring the lights back up and its

667
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,290 
again just to go stress the point scary
RTC

668
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,690 
there we are at a frequency that it's
just a little above the sea

669
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,580 
and we can go back there and in the sea
and we can actually get a phase reversal

670
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,820 
and I guess if we do this long enough we
get at the at the whole ocean and put it

671
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,589 
back in

672
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,750 
we're ever comes from is there in cars
in newsrooms gonna run is not running

673
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,580 
too long by the Rev trailer get here yet
to be careful as well as the Moody Blues

674
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,240 
V

675
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,220 
surface well I don't know about them but
I guess I believe you back its

676
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,400 
up a little more pressure on three gods
monarchy

677
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,750 
Adams girlfriends or service teams

678
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,100 
going things together Ste

679
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,589 
we have these machines are all over the
place lot of fun

680
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:08,640 
but that this this is really terrific I
i think that

681
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,010 
the this whole idea of the

682
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,220 
and abusing aliens saying in stroz and

683
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,600 
the kinds of things that did you do with
the murder just fantastic in that we

684
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,230 
really appreciate the chance to

685
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,310 
come in here and see the demonstration
Rose Bowl game ruth's

686
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,830 
hope you will use it for years the bar
over many years to come

687
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,109 
so is I emphasized that the beginning

688
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:36,030 
in what situations aliasing can in fact
be very useful

689
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,770 
also with this demonstrates is that
particularly when you have a colleague

690
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,150 
like da kitchen

691
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,180 
a leasing and for that matter science in
general can be an awful lot of fun

692
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:53,180 
by gonna thanks a lot that again and
thank you just the name

693
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,920 
well I have to say that that visit was
an awful lot of fun for me and

694
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,330 
for Justin in fact to for the whole
camera crew that was

695
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:09,140 
there and hopefully you all have used at
some point will also have a chance to

696
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,200 
visited stroll Valley well

697
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,380 
hopefully what we've gone through today
gives you

698
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,520 
a good feeling for the concepts love
sampling an alias saying

699
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,890 
and both why it might be useful and why
we might want to avoid

700
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,100 
in the next lecture will continue on

701
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,280 
the discussion of sampling any
particular

702
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,930 
what all be talking about is the
interpretation

703
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,640 
love the reconstruction process not in
the frequency domain

704
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,780 
but in a time-domain interpretation
specifically associated

705
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,410 
with the concept %uh interpolating
between the samples

706
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:53,060 
well then proceed from there too a
discussion as i've alluded to

707
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,060 
in several lectures love what i've
referred to as

708
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,830 
discrete-time processing of
continuous-time signals

709
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:06,089 
very heavily exploiting the concept and
issues associated with sample

710
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:06,420 
thank you
