ha

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the norm

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
are

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
over the past several lectures we've developed the representation for linear

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
time-invariant systems

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
in a particularly important center systems

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which are linear and time-invariant are those that are represented by linear

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
constant coefficient differential equations continuous-time

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or when your constant coefficient difference equations

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in discrete-time for example electrical circuits that are built let's say I dove

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
resistors inductors and capacitors perhaps with %ah pants

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
correspond to systems described by differential equations

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
mechanical systems with springs and dash pots likewise

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
are described by differential equations and in the discrete-time

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
case things such as moving average filters

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
digital filters and most simple kinda data smoothing

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
are all linear constant coefficient difference equations

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
now presumably

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in a previous course you've had some exposure to

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
differential equations for continuous-time and

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
their solution using notions like particular solution and homogeneous

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
solution initial conditions center

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
later on in the course

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
when we've developed the concept to the 48 transforming after that the

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
apostrophe its form

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
will see some very efficient and useful ways

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
generating solutions both differential and difference equations

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
at this point however I'd like to

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
just introduce when your constant coefficient

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
differential equations and the discrete-time counterpart

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and address among other things the issue

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
love when they do and don't correspond to linear time-invariant systems

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
well let's first consider

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
what I refer to as an nth order

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
linear constant coefficients differential equation as i've indicated

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
here

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and what it consists of is a linear combination of derivatives up the system

00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
output

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
y'at equal to a linear combination

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of derivatives above the system input accept T

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and is referred to

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
as a constant coefficients equation of course because the

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
coefficients are constant in other words not assume to be time-varying

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and its referred to

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
as linear because it corresponds to a linear combination

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
love these derivatives not because

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it corresponds to a linear system and in fact

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
as we'll see or as all indicate this

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
equation may or may not in fact correspond to

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
when your system in the discrete-time case

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the corresponding equation is a linear constant coefficient difference equation

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and that corresponds to again

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a linear combination love the late versions of the output equal to

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
a linear combination love the late versions at the input

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
this equation is referred to as an nth order

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
difference equation the N referring to the number of the ladies

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
are the output involved just as an aunt order differential equation

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
the N for the order the equation refers to the number of derivatives

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the output now let's first begin

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
with the near constant coefficient differential equations

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the basic

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
point or the solution for

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the differential equations is the fact dead

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if we've generated some solution

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
which I refer to here's why superiority some solution

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to the equation for a given input then

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
in fact we can and to that solution

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
any other solution which

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
satisfies what's referred to as

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the homogeneous equation so in fact

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this differential equation by itself

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
is not a unique specification

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the system

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
if I have any solution then I can

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and to that solution any other solution which satisfies the homogeneous equation

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and thus all those two

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
likewise be a solution and that's very straight forward to verify

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
by simply substituting into the differential equation

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
some love the particular a particular and the homogeneous solution

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and what you see is that the homogeneous contribution

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
in fact goes to zero by definition

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
what we mean by the homogeneous equation now

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the homogeneous solution for a when your constant coefficient differential

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
equation

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
is of the form that I

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
indicate at the bottom and

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it typically consists love a

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
song or capital and complex exponentials

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and the Constance

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
are on determined by the equation itself

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and this form for the homogeneous solution

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
in essence drops out love examining

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the homogeneous equation where

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
if we assume that the former the homogeneous solution

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is a complex exponential with some

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
on specified amplitude and unspecified exponent

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
if we substitute this into are homogeneous equation

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
we end up with the equation that i've indicated

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
year the factor A&E the st. can in fact be

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
cancelled out and we find there that equation

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is satisfied

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
for capital N values

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
love s and

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that's true no matter what choices made for these

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
coefficients and the essential consequence

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
have all of that is that the homogeneous solution

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is of the form that I indicated previously

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
namely it consists love some

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
love capital and complex exponentials

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
where the coefficients the capital and coefficients

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
attached to you to those complex exponentials

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is undetermined Iran specified

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so what this says is that in order to

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
obtain the solution for a win here comes the coefficient differential equation

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
we need some kind of auxiliary information

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
tells us how to obtain these capital and

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
undetermined Constance and there are a variety of ways

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
specifying this auxiliary information or auxiliary conditions

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
for example in addition to the differential equation

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
what I can tell you is the value

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
of the output and and -1 up there

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and -1 if its derivatives at some

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
specified time t0 and

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
so the differential equations together

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
with the auxiliary information the initial conditions

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
van lets you determine the total solution

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
which namely lets you determine these previously unspecified

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
coefficients in the homogeneous solution

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
now depending on how the auxiliary information is stated or what auxiliary

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
information is available

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the system a or may not correspond

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to a linear system and may or may not correspond to a linear time-invariant

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
system one essential condition

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for it to correspond to a linear system is that

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the initial conditions must be zero

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and one can see the reason for that

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
if we refer back to the previous lecture in which we saw that for a linear system

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
if we put 0n we get zero out

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
so if exit see the input is zero the output must be zero

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and so that in essence tells us that at least for the system to be linear

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
these initial conditions must be zero

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
now beyond that if

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we want the system to be

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
causal and linear time in and time-invariant

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
then what's required on the

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
initial conditions is that they be consistent with

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
what's referred to as initial rest initial arrest says

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that the output must be

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
0 up until the time

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that the input becomes 90 and we can see

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of course that that's consistent with the notion of causality as

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we talked about in the previous lecture and

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
its relatively straightforward to see

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that if the system is causal and linear and time-invariant

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that will require

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
initial rest it's somewhat more difficult see

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that if we specify initial rest the NAT in fact is sufficient to

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
determine that the system is both causal in linear

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and time very but the essential point then is that

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
requires initial rest for both linearity

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and causality okay well

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
let's look at an example and

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
let's take the example love a first-order

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
differential equation as I've

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
indicated here so we have

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
a first-order differential equation the wife TTT

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
was a yote is the input exit

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
T and let's first

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
look at what the homogeneous solution this equation is

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and so we can consider the homogeneous equation

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
namely the equation specify solutions

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which would correspond to zero input

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we in essence guess for impose

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
a solution love the form the homogeneous solution

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
is an amplitude factor times the complex exponential

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
substituting this into the homogeneous equation

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
we then get the equation that i've indicated here

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what you can see is that this equates in this equation

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can cancel out the amplitude factor and this complex exponential

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
so let's just cancel those out on both sides of the equation

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and what we're left with is an equation

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that specifies what the complex exponent must be

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
in particular for the homogeneous solution s must be equal to minus a

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and so finally are homogeneous solution

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is as I've indicated year

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
okay now let's look at the solution for specific input let's consider for

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
example input

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
which is a scale units step and

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
although I won't work at the solution in detail and perhaps

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
using what you've worked on previously

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
you know how to carry out the solution for that the

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a solution with step input

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
is what i've indicated here scaler one minus the next financial times unit

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
staff and you can verify that simply by substituting into the differential

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
equations now

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we know that there's a family of solutions in other words

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
any solution with

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a homogeneous solution added to it is again a solution

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and so if we consider the solution I just indicated

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
we generate the entire family of solutions by

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ending a homogeneous solution to it and so

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
this then corresponds to the entire family of solutions

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
where the constant a is unspecified

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so far and needs to be specified through some type avoids avery conditions

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
now a class A auxiliary conditions

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is the Commissioner initial rest which

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
as i indicated before is equivalent to the statement that the system

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
is causal and linear and time-invariant and

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in that case for the initial rest condition

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
we would then require in this equation above

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that this constant be equal to 0

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and so finally the response

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to scales step if the system

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is the correspond to cause a linear time-invariant system

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is then just this term namely

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
constant times one minus an exponential

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
times step

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
okay now if the system is a linear time-invariant system

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
it can as we know be described through its impulse response

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and as you've worked out previously

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in the video course manual for

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a linear time-invariant system the impulse response

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
is the derivative love the step response adjusted quickly remind you

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
love where that result comes from in essence

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
we can consider to linear time-invariant systems and Cascade

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
wanna differentiator the other the system that we're talking about

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
described by

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the differential equation and step in here

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
then generated in polls into our system

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and out comes the impulse response well just using the fact that

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
these are both linear time-invariant systems and they can be cascaded in

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
either order

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
then means that if we have step response

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
to our system and that goes through differentiator

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
what must come out again is the impulse response

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
so differentiating the step response we get the impulse response

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
here again is the step response as we

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
just worked it out this time for you next step if we differentiate

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
we have then since the step response

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
is the product of two terms the derivative a product is the sum

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
the derivatives and carrying that algebra through

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and using the fact that the derivative the step

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is an impulse finally we come down

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to this statement for the impulse response

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and then recognizing that this is but I'm

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
function times and in polls and we know

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that a time function times in polls takes on

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the value at the time that the impulse occurs

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
then this term is simply 0

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and the impulse response then

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
finally is an exponential this for

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and this is the peking exponential for a positive

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
it's a growing exponentially for a negative and

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
recall that as we talked about previously

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
a system is a linear time-invariant system is stable

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
if its impulse response is absolutely integral

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
for this particular case this impulse response

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
is absolutely integral provided that

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the exponential factor a

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
is greater than 0

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
okay so what we've seen then is the

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
impulse response for system described by a linear constant coefficient

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
differential equation

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
where in addition we will impose causality

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
when you're ready in time invariance essentially through the initial

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
conditions

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
love initial rest

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
now pretty much the same kinds of things happen

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
with difference equations as we've gone through

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
with differential equations in particular

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
again let me remind you love the form love

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and aunt order when your constant coefficient difference equation

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
its as I indicate here and

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
again a linear combination this time the late versions of the output equal to a

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
linear combination

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
up the late versions love the input once again

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the difference equation is not

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
a complete specification the system because we can and to the response

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
any homogeneous solution in other words

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
any solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in the summer those well also satisfy the original

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
difference equation so if we have

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
a particular response that satisfies

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the difference equation then ending to that

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
any response there is a solution to the homogeneous equation

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
will also be a solution to the total equation

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the homogeneous solution again is of the form

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
of a linear combination of exponentials here

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
we have the homogeneous equation as with

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
differential equations we can

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
guests or impose solutions for

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
eight times an exponential when we substitute this

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
into the homogeneous equation we then end up

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
with equation that i've indicated here we recognize again

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
there a the amplitude

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and seats at the end

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
this exponential factor cancel out

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and so this equation is satisfied

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
for any values love see

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that satisfy this equation and

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
there are and roots C-one through Z and

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and so finally the form for the homogeneous solution

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
is a linear combination love capital and

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
exponentials capital and is the order the equation

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
with each of those exponentials the ample to factor is undetermined

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and needs to be determined in some way through

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the imposition love appropriate

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
initial conditions are boundary conditions

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
so the general form then

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
for the solution to the difference equation

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
is

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
some with the exponentials plus any particular solution

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
its through auxiliary conditions that we determine

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
these coefficients we have

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and undetermined coefficients and so

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we require capital and auxiliary conditions

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
for example some set values

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
of the output at and this thing instance

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
time

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
now this

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
was the same as with differential equations in the case a differential

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
equations we talked about specifying

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the value of the output and its derivatives and

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
there we indicated dead for linearity

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
what we required when the arity what we require

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
is that the auxiliary conditions 30

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and the same thing applies here for the same reason

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
namely if the system is to be linear and the response if there's no input must be

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
equal to 0

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
in addition what

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
we may want to impose on the system is

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that it be causal and in addition to linear

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
time-invariant and with that requires again

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is that it the auxiliary conditions be consistent with

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
initial rest namely that if

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the input is zero prior to some time

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
in the output is zero prior to the same time

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
okay so we've seen a very direct parallel

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so far between differential equations

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and difference equations

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
in fact one difference between them dead

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in some sense makes difference equations

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
easier to deal with in some situations is dead

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
in contrast to a differential equation a

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
difference equation if we assume causality

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
in fact is and explicit

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
input-output relationship for the system now let me

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
show you what I mean

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
let's consider the n-th order difference equation as i've indicated here

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and let's assume that we're imposing causality

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
so there'd the output can only depend

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
on prior values at the input and therefore on fire values at the output

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
well we can simply rearrange this equation

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
solving for Y have an the leading term with cable 0

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
taking all the other turns over to the right side of the equation

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and we then have a workers if equation

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
namely that an equation expresses the output interns

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
love prior values if the input which is this term

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and prior values at the output

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and so if in fact we have this equation running

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
then once it started we know how to compute

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the output for the next time

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
well

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
how do we get started the way we get it started of course

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is through the appropriate said love

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
initial conditions are boundary conditions and if for example

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
we assume initial rest corresponding to a causal when you're time-invariant

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
system

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
then if the input is zero up until sometime

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the output must be zero up until that time and Matt in essence

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
helps us get the equation started well let's look at this

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
specifically in the context love a

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
first-order difference equation so let's take

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
a first-order difference equation

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
as i've indicated here

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and so we have an equation that tells us that why I have and minus eight times

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
wider than -1

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is equal to exit

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
now if we want this to correspond to

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
a causal linear time-invariant system we

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
oppose initial impose initial rest on it we can

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
rewrite the first-order difference equation by taking

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the term involving y ven -1

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
over to the right hand side of the equation

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
right now this gives us a workers if equation

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
that expresses the output interns the input and past values at the output

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and since we've impose causality

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and if we're talking about a linear time-invariant system

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
we can now inquire as to what the impulse responses and we know of course

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that the impulse response

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
charles is everything that we need to know about the system

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
okay so let's shoes and input which is

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
an impulse so the impulse response

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is Beltre van corresponding

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
to the exit and appear plus eighty Delta

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
love this should be a chip N -1

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and let me just correct that this is a chip N -1

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so we have the impulse response as Delta van

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
was eight times a Japan -1

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
now from initial rest we know

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
bad since the input namely an impulse is 0 for and less than zero

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
the impulse response is likewise 0

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
for and less 0 and now

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
let's work out what 80 its well

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
80 with an equal 0 is

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
delta up zero plus eight times

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
a chip N -1 HRN minus 10

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and so h0 is equal to 1

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
okay now that we have a chance 0 we can figure at H

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
one by running this recursive equations

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
so 8 you've won is

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Delta love one which is zero

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
plus eight times h0 which we just figured out as one

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
so HR one is equal to a and if we carry this through

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
will have a chip to equal to a squared and

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
this will continue on and in fact we can recognize

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
by looking at this and how we would expect these terms to build

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
we would see that the impulse response a Japan

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
in fact -ism form a to the end times

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
you have an

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and we also can recognize then dead

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
this corresponds to stable system

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
if and only if the impulse response

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
which is what we just figured out if and only if the impulse response

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
is absolutely so noble and what that will require

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
is that the magnitude a the less

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
okay now we impose causality linear ready in time invariance

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and generated a solution recur simply

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and now of course if we want to generate the more general

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
center solutions to this difference equation

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
we can't do that by adding all of the

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
homogeneous solutions namely all the solutions to satisfy the homogeneous

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
equation so

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
here we have the causal linear time-invariant

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
impulse response in fact

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
with an impulse input all of the possible solutions

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
are that impulse response plus

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the homogeneous solutions the homogeneous solution is the solution

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that satisfies the homogeneous equation

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
that will in general

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
believe the form an amplitude factor

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
times an exponential factor and

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
if we substitute this into this equation

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
then we see that the homogeneous

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
equation is satisfied for any values have a

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
in any values see that satisfy

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
this equation again as we did with differential equations

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the factor Amy cancels out and also in fact I can cancel out is either the N

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
there and seat to the end here

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and so what we're left with is a statement that tells us

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
then dead the homogeneous

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
solution is over for AC to the end

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
for any ban you capital A and any value

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
see it satisfies this equation and

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
that values the in particular is the

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
people today so the homogeneous solution then

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
is any exponential this form with any amplitude factor

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and so the family of solutions with an impulse

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
input is the solution

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
corresponding to the system being cause a linear and time-invariant

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
plus the homogeneous sir

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
if

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
we impose causality Lenny a ready in time invariance

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
on the system then of course that additional

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
exponential factor will be 0 in other words capital A

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
is 0

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
okay now in we seen the

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
differential equations and difference equations interns

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
love

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
the fact there there are families have solutions

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and in order to get causality Lenny a ready in time

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
variance requires imposing a particular set initial conditions namely

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
imposing initial rest on the system

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
let's now look at the difference equation

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagrams

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
now p the difference equation at

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I just simply repeated here is why I have an

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is accident was a white van -1

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
where I've taken that the late term

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
over to the right hand side of the equation so in effect

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
what on imposing on this system is causality

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm assuming that if I know the past history

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
the input and the output I can determine

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the next value the out

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
well we can in fact draw a block diagram

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
represents that equation the equation says

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we take exit and for any given bad you

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
a van say n0 whatever bad you were computing the output were

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
we take the input at that time

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and and to it the factor a

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
times the output value that we calculated last time so

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
if we have excessive and which is our input

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and if we have why I have and which is our output

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
we in fact can't get why I have an

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
by taking the last value why event

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
indicated here by putting why I have an

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
threw it away multiplying Matt

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
by the factor

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
a

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and then Anning that result

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to

00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the input

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and the result the doing that is

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
why event

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
so the way this block diagram

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
might be interpreted for example as an algorithm is this a

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
dead we take exit Van add to it

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
eight times the previous value the output that some gives us

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
the current value of the output which we then put out of the system

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and also put into a delay element or

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
basically it was stored register to use on the next generation a recursion

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
now how do we get this started well we know that the difference equation

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
requires initial conditions

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and in fact the initial conditions

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
correspond to what we store

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in that the late register when this block diagram

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
equation initially starts up

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
okay now let's look at

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
this for the case %uh difference equations

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
more generally

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
so what we said is dead we can calculate the output by

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
having previous values that the input

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
previous values at the output and forming

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the appropriate linear combination so

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
let's just build up the more general block diagram

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that would correspond to this

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and what it says is that we want to have a mechanism

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
restoring past values the input in a mechanism for story past values at the

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,000
output

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and i've indicated that on this figure

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
so far by a chain love

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the layout its indicating

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
that whatever what

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
the output each delay is the input

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
delayed by one time it's

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
or or interval and so

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
what we see down this chain of the ladies are the late replications

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
love the input and what we see

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
on the other chain is delayed

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
replications love the output

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
now the difference equation says that we want to take these

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and multiply them by the appropriate coefficients

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the coefficients in the difference equation and so we can do that

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
as i've indicated here so

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
now we have these delay elements each multiplied

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
by the appropriate coefficients on the input and by

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
appropriate coefficients on the output those are then

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
songs together and

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
so we now what's on these and what's on these

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
after we've some these we want to add

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
those together and there's a factor 1 over 80 that comes in

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and that and generates are out

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and so this in fact and

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
represents a block diagram which is a general block diagram for implementing

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
war representing near constant coefficient difference

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
wage

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
now if you think about what it means in terms of what's a computer algorithm or

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
a piece of hardware

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in fact this block diagram is a recipe or algorithm for doing the

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
implementation

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
by it's important to

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
recognize even at this point dad it's only one

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
many possible algorithms or implementations for this difference

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
wage

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
just for example

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I can consider that equation

00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
core that block diagram

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and here I've redrawn at so

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
here once again I have the same block diagram that we just saw

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and I can recognize for example

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that this in essence corresponds to

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
to linear time-invariant systems

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
in cascade

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
now that assumes of course that my

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
initial conditions are such dad I that the system is in fact

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
when you're and that in turn requires that we're assuming initial rest namely

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
before the input does anything

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
other than 0 there are just zero value stored in the registers

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
but assuming that it corresponds to a linear time-invariant system

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
this is a cascade to linear time-invariant systems

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
we know that two linear time-invariant systems can be cascaded

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
in either order so in particular I can consider

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
breaking this cascade here and moving this block

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
over to the other side and so let's just

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
do that

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and when I do

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I then have

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
this combination systems

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and of course you can ask what advantage there is to do in at

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and the advantage arises because it the fact

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
there'd in this form

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
exactly what is stored in these delays

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
is also stored in the still air registers

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
in other words it's this intermediate variable

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
whatever it is down this chain of delays and down this chain of the ladies

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and so in fact I can collapse those delays

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
into a single chain of delays and

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the network that I'm left with is the network that I indicate

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I missed you graph where what I've done is to simply collapse that

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
double chain of the ladies into a single chain

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the waves

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
now want to ask well what's the advantage to doing that and the

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
advantage

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
one advantage simply stated is that when you think in terms of an implementation

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
of a difference equation

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the lady corresponds to

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
storage register a memory location and by this

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
by simply using the fact that we can interchange the order in which linear

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
time-invariant systems are cascaded

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
we can reduce the amount of memory by a factor to

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
okay now

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and essentially similar procedure can also be used for

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
differential equations in terms of implementation

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
using block diagrams for the interpretation implementations

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
using like diagrams and let me first do that

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
rather than in general let me first do it in the in

00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the context love a specific example

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
so

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
let's consider a when your constant coefficient differential equation as

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
i've indicated here

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and I have terms on the left side in terms on the right side

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and with the differential equation

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
let's consider taking overturns

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
over to the right side of the equation except

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
for the highest the residue in the output next we

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
integrate both sides of the equation are so that

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
when we're done we end up with the on the left side of the equation

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
with y ft on the right side of the equation with the appropriate number

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
%uh integrations and so the InterPro equation

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
that will get is for this example y ft the output is except the

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
plus be the scale factor times the integral

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the input and -8 at scale factor times the integral

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the output so to

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
form the output in a block diagram turns

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
we form a linear combination of the input

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
scaled in to grow the input and a scale

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
integral love the output all of that and it together

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
so we need in addition to

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
the input we need the integral

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
love the input and so this box indicates an integrator

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
in addition to the output we need

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
the integral the output and now

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
to for why ft we

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
multiply the integrated in play

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
by the scale factor B and

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and back to exit C

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and retake the integrated output multiplied by Minas de

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and and to that

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the result are the previous addition

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and according to the integral equation then that forms

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the output

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
so just as we did with the difference equation

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
we've converted the differential equation to

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
an integral equation and we have a block diagram for very similar

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
to what we had in the case the difference equation now the initial

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
conditions of course

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
are tied up and again how these integrators

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
are initialized assuming that we impose initial rest on the system

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
weekend thinkers the overall system is a linear time-invariant system

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and it's a cascade one linear time-invariant system with the second

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
so we can in fact

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
break this

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and consider interchanging the order in which these two systems a cascade

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and so i've indicated that down below here

00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I've simply taken the top block diagram

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
interchange the order in which the to

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
systems are cascaded and

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
here again we can ask what the advantages to this

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
as opposed to the previous one and what you can see

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
just as we saw with the difference equation is that

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
now the integrators both integrators

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
are integrating the same thing in particular

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the input to this integrator and the input

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
to this integrator are identical so in fact

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
rather than using this one we can simply tap of

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
from here we can in fact remove this integrator

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
break this connection

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and happy and at this point and so

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
what we've done and by interchange in the order in which the systems are

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
cascaded

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
is reduced the implementation to the implementation

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
with a single integrated very much similar to

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
what we talked about in the case the difference wage

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
now let's just again with the integral equation

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
way the differential equation looked at

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
this somewhat more generally again

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
if we take the differential equation the general differential equation

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
integrated a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
we would then have this cascaded systems

00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
and again if we assume initial rest

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
so that these are both linear time-invariant systems

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
we can interchange the order in which they are cascaded

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
namely take the second system and

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
move it

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to proceed the first system

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and then we recognize is that the input to this change

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
integrators and this change integrators is exactly the same

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and so in fact we can collapse these together

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
using only one change integrators and the system

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
there we're left with then is system

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that looks as i've indicated here so we have

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
now just a single chain integrators

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is that a the two sets in

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case the

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
difference equation

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
again why do we want to cut the number integrators in half

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
well one reason is because integrators in effect represent hardware

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and if we use half as much if we have half as many integrators

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
then using half as much hard

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
okay well let me just conclude by summarizing

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
a number of points I indicated at the beginning

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
that linear constant coefficient differential equations a difference

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
equations

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
will play an important role as linear time-invariant systems

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
throughout this coursing throughout the center lectures

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I also stress

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the fact that differential or difference equations

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
by themselves are not a complete specification

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the system because of the fact that we can and

00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
to any solution a homogeneous

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I do we specify the appropriate initial conditions

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
to ensure how do we specify the appropriate initial conditions to ensure

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
that the system

00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
is linear and time-invariant well

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the auxiliary information namely the initial conditions

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
dissociated with the system

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
be causal linear and time-invariant

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
are the conditions of initial rest

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and in fact for most of the cores

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
what will be interested in systems that are in fact cause a linear and

00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
time-invariant

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and so we will in fact be assuming initial rest conditions

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
now

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
as I also indicated their are

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
a variety of efficient procedures for solving differential

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and difference equations that we haven't yet address and

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
beginning with the next set of lectures will be talking about

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
for EA transform and much later in the course

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
what's referred to as the apostrophe its form for continuous-time

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and sea transport for discrete-time and what we'll see

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
is that with the Fourier transform in later with the apostasy transform

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
will have a number love efficient and very useful ways

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
%uh generating the solution for

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
differential and difference equations this under the assumption that the

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
system is causal

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
when you're in time very

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
also will see in addition to the block diagram implementations

00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the systems that we talked about so far

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
we'll see another a number of other useful

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
implementations that exploit a variety of properties associated with

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Korean past thank you
