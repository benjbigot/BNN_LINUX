important algebraic properties one being

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the result ok involving h1 with h2

adding the two together and that result
添加两个在一起，那结果

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
will be the same as this result
将是相同的，因此这个结果

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
so convolution is community
因此卷积社区

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
associative and it distributes over addition
联想并将其分发给了另外

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
three very important algebraic properties and
三个非常重要的代数性质和

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
by the way there are other algebraic operations that have

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
are both very interesting and very important
都是非常有趣和非常重要的

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
let's begin with the community property
让我们开始与小区物业

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and consider in particular
并特别考虑

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
a system with an impulse response age
带有脉冲响应年龄的系统

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and I represent that by simply writing the H inside the box
我代表通过简单地写在H盒内

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
an input tax and an output then
进项税和输出，然后

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
which is X convulsed with age
这为X忍俊不禁随着年龄的增长

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
now since this operation is commuted to
现在因为这个操作是改判

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can right is that affects convolved with a I can write
我可以用鼠标右键是影响卷积与我可以写

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
H convolved with ex and that would correspond
ħ卷积前，而将对应

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to a system with impulse response
用脉冲响应系统

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
X and input H and output then
X和输入H和输出，然后

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
age involved with ex
涉及年龄与前

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
so the community property
所以小区物业

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
tells us therefore a linear time-invariant system
告诉我们，因此一个线性时不变系统

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the system output is independent

all which function we call the input
所有这些功能，我们称之为输入

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and which function we call the impulse response kind amazing actually
以及功能我们称之为脉冲响应那种惊人的实际

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
we can interchange the role input and impulse response
我们可以互换角色的输入和脉冲响应

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and from input or permit output point of view
而且从输入或许可证输出点

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the output for the system doesn't care
该系统的输出不关心

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
now furthermore if we combine the community property
而且现在如果我们结合社区物业

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
with the associative property we get another very interesting result
与关联属性，我们得到另一个非常有趣的结果

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
namely that if we have two linear time-invariant systems in cascade
即，如果我们有两个线性时不变系统的级联

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the overall system is independent of the order in which they are cascaded
整个系统是独立于它们所级联的顺序

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and in fact in either case the Cascade can be
而事实上在两种情况下，梯级可以是

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
collapsed into a single system
折叠成一个单一的系统

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to see this let's first consider
看到这个我们先考虑

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the Cascade or two systems one with impulse response h1
级联或两个系统之一，脉冲响应H1

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the other with impulse response h2 and

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and then that is the input to the second system

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and so the output a bad is that result
所以输出一个糟糕的是，结果

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
convolved with h2
卷积H2

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
so this is the result of cascading the two

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
same

to group these two terms together
以组这两个名词在一起

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and X convulsed with h2
和X笑得H2

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
corresponds to putting X first through the system h2
