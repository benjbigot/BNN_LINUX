the last lecture we discuss the number

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
general properties for systems which

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
as you recall applied both to continuous-time

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and to discrete-time systems

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and these properties were the properties

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
associated with the system having memory the issue

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
love whether a system is or isn't convertible

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we talked about causality instability

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and finally we talked about when the arity

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and time-invariant in today's lecture

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
what I'd like to do is focused specifically on when the arity in time

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
invariance

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and show how for systems that have those properties

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we can exploit them to generate

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a general representation well let me begin by

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
just reviewing the two properties again quickly

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
time invariance as you recall

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is a property that apply both to continuous-time and discrete-time

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
systems

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and in essence stated bad for any given

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
input and output relationship if we

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
simply shift the input than the output shift by the same amount

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and of course exactly the same kind of statement

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
applied in discrete-time so it i mean variance was a property

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it said that the system didn't care about what the time origin

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the signal is when the arity

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
was a property related to the fact that if we have

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
et cetera outputs associated with a given set of inputs

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
as i've indicated here with the inputs

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
as feasted K and the output decisive K

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then the property of when the arity

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
States that if we have an input

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
which is a linear combination up those inputs

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
then the output is

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
a linear combination of the Associated outputs

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so that linear combination of inputs

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
generates for linear system at the end output which is

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
a linear combination up the Associated outputs now

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the question is how can we exploit the properties have many arity

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and time-invariant and there's a basic strategy

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
which will flow more or less through mostly this court's

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the strategy is to

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
attempt to decompose the signal you the continuous-time and discrete-time

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
into it said a basic signals

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and I've indicated that

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
here and the question then

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is what basic signal should we pick well

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the answer kinda is we should pick said a basic signals

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
they provide a certain degree have analytical convenience

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
so we choose instead of inputs for the decomposition

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
bad provide outputs

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that we can easily generate now and we'll see

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
when we do this there are to

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
classes love inputs that are particularly suited

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to that strategy one class is

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the set love the late impulses namely

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
decomposing a signal into a linear combination if the

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is and as we'll see that leads to a representation

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
for linear time-invariant systems which is referred to

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
as convolution a second

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is a decomposition of inputs into complex exponentials

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and that leads to a representation

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
love signals and systems through what will refer to as

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
for your analysis now

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
four-day analysis will be a topic for

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
a setup later lectures but I'd like to begin with

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is the representation in terms of impulses and the associated description

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
linear time-invariant systems using convolution

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so let's begin where

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
a discussion are discrete-time signals

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and in particular the issue of how discrete-time signals

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
can be decomposed as a linear combination

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
love the lady impulses

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
well in fact it's relatively straightforward

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
what I've shown here is a general

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
sequence with values which i've indicated

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
at the top and more or less

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
as we did when we talked about representing

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a unit step in terms of impulses

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we can think of this general sequence as a sequence

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll impulses delayed

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
namely occurring at the appropriate

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
prime instant and and with the appropriate ample to

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
so we can think love this general sequence

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
as and im polls occurring at an equal 0

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and and with the high dive exit 0

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
plus and im polls all quite active one

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
occurring at time n equals 1 and so that's active one time

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Delta than -1 and in polls at -1

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
with an amplitude love exit -1

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
et cetera so if we continue

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to generate a said Oh waited the late unit samples like that

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and if we had all these together

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
then that will generate the total sequence

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
algebraically then what that corresponds to

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
is representing the sequence as

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
some love individual turns over as i've indicated here

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or in terms over general thumb

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the song %uh exit K felt the then minus K

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
so that's our strategy the strategy is to decompose

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
an arbitrary sequence into a linear combination

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
or waited too late impulses and here

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
again is the representation which we just

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
finish generating

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
now why is this representation useful

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's useful because we now have a decomposition at the sequence

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
as a linear combination all basic

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
sequences namely that the late impulses

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and if we are talking about a linear system

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the response to that linear combination is a linear combination of the responses

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
so if we denote the response

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to with the late in paul's as H+ the cave and

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
then the response to

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this general input is what i've indicated here

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
where why event of course is the output

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
due to the general in protective and

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
H+ the cave and is the output do

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to the late in polls and these are simply

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the coefficients in the waiting

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
so for linear system we have

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
this representation and

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
if now in addition the system is time-invariant

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we can in fact relate the outputs

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
due to these individuals the late in polls

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
specifically if the system is time-invariant

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
then the response to an impulse at the time

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
K is exactly the same as the response to an impulse at time 0

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
shifted over two-time K said another way

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
h2k a van it simply

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
80 then minus K where 80

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is the response to the system to an impulse at an equal 0

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and it's generally useful to

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
rather than carrying around 80 a band

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
just simply define 80 then

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as a chip and which is

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
the unit sample or unit impulse response to the system

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and so the consequent then is for

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
a linear time-invariant system

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the output can be expressed as this

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
some where a true then minus K

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
is the response to an impulse occurring at time n equals K

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and this is referred to

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
as the convolution saw

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
now we can just to emphasize

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
how we've going about this let me show it from another perspective

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
we of course have taken the sequence X the van

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
we have decomposed that as

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a linear combination out these waited the late impulses

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
when these are added together those correspond

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to the original sequence active and

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
if this in polls for example

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
generates a response

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
which is exit 0 times a chip and we're a tremendous the response

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
to unit in polls at an equal 0

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and the second one the late generates the delayed

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
waited response and the third one similarly

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and we generate these individual responses

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
these are all added together and it that linear combination

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that forms the final output

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so that's really kind of the way we're thinking about it we have a general

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
sequence

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we're thinking love each individual sample

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
individually each one of those pops the system

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and because the linearity the response is the sum

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
for those individual responses

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
well thats what happens in discrete-time and

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
pretty much the same strategy works in continuous-time

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a particular

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we can begin in continuous-time

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
with the notion 0 decomposing

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a continuous-time signal into

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
succession love are bitterly narrow rectangles

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and as these rectangles is the with the rectangles goes

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
0 the approximation gets better and

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
essentially what's going to happen is that you to those individual rectangles

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
as they get narrower and narrower correspond more and more

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to an impulse well let me show you what I mean

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
here we have a continue with time signal

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and I've approximated it

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
by staircase

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
so in Athens I can't think of this

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
as individual rectangles

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
a fight associated with the height the continuous curve

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and so i've indicated that down below here for example

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
is the impulse corresponding to the rectangle between

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
people's -2 dealt in people's minds felker

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
here's the one from minus felt that 20

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and as we continue on down we get

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
impulses or rather rectangles from success the park to the way for

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
now let's look specifically at the

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
rectangle for example starting at zero and ending at Delta

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and the amplitude of it is exit Delta

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and so

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
what we have actually this should be exit 0

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and so not be just correct that

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
here that sex is zero and so

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
we have a rectangle a fight exit 0

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and recall the function that I defined last time

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
as dealt this the capital Delta p

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which had height1 over Delta and with dealt

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so multiply finally by this last little Delta

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
then this is a representation for

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the rectangle that i've shown there now

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
there's a little bit about you were there too kinda track through

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but what we're really doing is just simply representing this

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
in terms the rectangles what I want to do is describing each rectangle

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
as in terms that function dealt with the bell 30

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
which in the limit then becomes an impulse well so extract that

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
through a little further

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
when we have that linear combination

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
then were saying that x50 can be represented

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
by Osama's I indicate here

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
which I can then

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
right more generally in this form just indicating that this is an infinite sum

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
we now want to take the limit as Delta goes to zero

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and his daughter goes to zero notice

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that this term becomes are bitterly narrow

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this goes to our impulse function and this of course

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
goes to exit Towne and in fact

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in the limit some out this form

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
is exactly the way an integral is the point

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
so we have an expression for wire T

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in terms of an impulse function their I have to admit

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
is a little bit have detailed the kinda focus on

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
at your leisure but this is the general load the strategy

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
so what we have now is and integral

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
tell that tells us how except he can be described

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
as a thong or linear combination

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
involving in polls

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
this bottom equation by the way is often referred to as the sifting integral

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
in essence what it says is that if I take a time function exit tea and put it

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
through that integral

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the impulse as did dipped by

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
generates X-eighty all over again

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
now at first glance what it could look like

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is that we've taken a time function X 50

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and proceeded to represented in a very complicated way

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
interns have itself and one could ask her why bother doing that

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and the reason going back to what r

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
strategy was is that

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
what we want to do is exploit

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the property lovely area so

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
by describing a time function

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
as a linear combination have waited too late impulses

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
as in effect we've done through

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
this some Asian that corresponds to a decomposition in terms of impulses

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
we can now exploit linearity

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
specifically recognizing that the output

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
have a linear system is this some

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
or the responses to these individual inputs

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
so with h2k

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Delta I love see corresponding to the response

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to built this adult the T-minus k Delta

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and arrested this stop the exit k Delta and there's little doubt the

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
are basically scale factors for a linear system

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
then if the input is expressed in this form

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the output is expressed in this form

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
again taking the limit is Delta goes to zero

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
by definition this corresponds to an integral

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and it the integral that we indicated that I indicate here

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
with H+ the tower T corresponding to

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the impulse response

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
due to an impulse occurring at

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
time town now again we can do

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the same thing a in particular

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
if the system is time-invariant then the response to each of these the late

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
impulses

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
is simply at the late version up the impulse response

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and so we can relate these individual terms

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and in particular than the response to an impulse occurring at time t cloth

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
towel

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
it's simply the response to an impulse occurring at time 0

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
shifted over to the time origin town

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and again as we did before but dropped the subscript 80

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
so 80 love the

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
will simply defined as a trip to the

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and what we're left with when we do that

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
is the description over linear time-invariant system

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
through this integral which tells us

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
how the output is related to

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the input and two the impulse response

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
again let's just quickly look at this

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
from another perspective as we did in discrete-time

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
recall that what we've done is to take the

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
continuous function decomposed it in terms

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
%uh rectangles and then

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
each of these rectangles generates

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
its individual response

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and then these individual responses are added together

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and as we go through that process

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the chorus there's a process whereby

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
we let the approximation go to the

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to the representation over smooth talker

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
now again I stress that their is certainly

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
paramount to kinda examined carefully there

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but it's important to also reflect on what we've done which

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is really pretty significant well we've managed to accomplish

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is to exploit the properties linear ready in time invariance

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
so that the system could be represented

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
interns only over its response to

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and in polls at time 0 so for a linear time-invariant system quite amazingly

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
actually

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
if you know its response to an impulse at equal 0 or 10 equal 0 depending on

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
discrete or continuous time then in fact

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
through the convolution some in discrete-time or the convolution

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
integral in continuous-time

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
you can generate the response to an arbitrary input

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
let me just introduced a small amount have

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
notation again reminding you

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
all her the convolution some in the discrete-time case

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
which looks as i've indicated here this summer

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
exit Khon minus K

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
will have the requirement to making such frequent reference

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
to convolution dead it can be any and

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to notation we represented as I have here with an asterisk

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and so X a van with the asterisk

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
a trip and means r denotes the convolution affects a van with a chip

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and correspondingly in the continuous-time case

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
we have the convolution integral in which

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
here is the third thing in to grow as we talked about representing exit the

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
interns or itself hour as a linear combination of the late impulses

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and here we have the convolution integral and again

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
will use the asterisk to denote convolution

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
now there's a lot about convolution

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
that we want to talk about it their properties of convolution which tell us

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
about properties

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
linear time-invariant systems also

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
it's important to focus on the mechanics

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
or implementing accomplish in in other words understanding and generating some

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
fluency and insight

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
into what these particulars

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
some an integral expressions me

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
so let's first look at discrete-time convolution

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and examine more specifically what in essence

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
some tells us to do in terms of manipulating the sequences

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
so and returning to the

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
expression for the

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
convolutions Tom as I show here

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
some love exit K a true then minus

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
K let's focused in on an example

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
where we choose active and as a unit

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
step and a chip and as Arial exponential

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
times the unit step so with the quick fix a van

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
is as they indicate here

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
sequence a true fan is an exponential for positive time in zero for negative

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
time so we have active and in a tube and

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but now let's look back at the equation and

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
let me stress that what we want is not

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
excessive and nature then we want exit K

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
because we're going to some over K and not a trip K

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
but a chip and minus K

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
so we have then from

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
expand its straightforward to generate exit K at that

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
simply changing the index it's a nation

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and what's a true then minus K well what they two-minus K

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
H A minus K is huka flipped over

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
so hip this is white

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
8 UK looks like than

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
this is what a2 n my SK looks like

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and in essence why it the operation of convolution

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
or the mechanics of convolution tells us to do

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is to take the sequence HO

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and minus K which is a check minus k position with its origin and cake balls

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and multiply this sequence by this sequence

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and some the product from K equals minus infinity plus infinity

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
so if we were to compute for example

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the output at an equal 0

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
as I positioned this sequence here this is that an equal 0

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I would take this and multiply it by this and some

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
from minus infinity plus infinity or

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
for an equal one I would position it here frank with two outs with position

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
it here at center

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
well you can kinda see what the idea is

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
let's look at this a little more dynamically and see it

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
in fact how one sequence fly past the other

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and how the output why I have an build up to

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the correct answer

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so the input they were considering is a step input

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
which I show here and the impulse response that we welcome all this with

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
is a decaying exponential now

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
to form the convolution we want the product %uh exit K

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
not with a chip K but with a chip and minus K

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
corresponding to taking a chief K and

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
reflecting at about the origin and then shifting it appropriately

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
so here we see HR then minus K for an equal to 0

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
namely H minus K and now a true

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
one minus K which will show next is this

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
shifted to the right by one point

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
here we have a 2-1 minus K

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
shifting to the right by one more point is a trip to minus K

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
shifting again to the right will have ages 3 minus K

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and now let's shift back to the left

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
until and is negative and

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
then will begin the convolution so here's an equal 0

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
any cause -1 any cause -2

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and and it was minus-3 now to form the convolution we want the product

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
exit k with a true then minus K song from

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
minus infinity plus infinity and

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
for and negative that product is zero and therefore the result the convolution

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
is zero

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
as we shift to the right will build up the convolution

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and the result the convolution will be shown on the bottom trace

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
so we begin the process

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
with and negative and here we have any calls -1

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
at n equals 0 we get our first 90 contribution

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
now as we ship further to the right corresponding to increasing N

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
we will accumulate more and more

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
turns in the psalm and the convolution

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
will build up in particular for this example

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the result to the convolution increases monotonically

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
asymptotically approaching a constant and that constant in fact

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
is just simply the accumulation love

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the values under the exponential

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
now let's carry out the convolution this time with an input which is a

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
rectangular pulses that have a step input

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
again the same impulse response namely the King exponential

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and so we want to begin with HR then minus K

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
again with and negative shown here and again with any negative

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
there are no 90 turns in the product

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and so the convolution for and negative will be zero as it was in the previous

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
case

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
again on the bottom trace will show the result of the convolution as the impulse

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
response

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
slides along at any cost 0 we get our first 90 term

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and as in increases passed

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
0 we will begin to generate an output

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
basically the same as the output that we generated with a step input

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
until the impulse response

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
reaches a point where as we slide further

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we slide outside the interval where the rectangle is non-zero

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
so when we slide one point further from what shown here

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the output will now DK

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
corresponding to the fact dead the

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
impulse responses sliding outside

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
the interval in which the input is non-zero

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and so on the bottom trace we now see the result that the convolution

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
okay so what

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
you've seen then is an example

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
love discrete-time convolution let's now

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
look at an example love continuous-time convolution

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and as you might expect continuous-time convolution operates in

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
exactly the same way continuous-time convolution

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
we have be expression again

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
y'at is an integral with

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
now except now NHL t minus

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
now it had exactly the same kinda perform

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
as we had previously for

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
discrete-time convolution and and in fact the mechanics

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
0 the continuous-time convolution are identical

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so here Misar example with X 50 equal to unity

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
step and 850 now a real exponential time two units that I show

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
here x50 which is the unit step function

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
here we have a gypsy

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
which is an exponential for positive time

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and 0 for negative time now

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
again looking back at the expression

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
work on pollution it's not accept either we want

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
its except now that we want and it's not

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
H all tea or a chip how that we want it

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
minus now we plan to multiply these together

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and integrate over the variable town

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and that gives us the output at any given time

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
if we wanted at another time we change the value

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the as an argument inside this integral

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
so here we have exit T

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
here we have a trip to you which isn't quite what we wanted

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
here we have except now and that's fine its just

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
X-eighty with T relabel this panel and now

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
what is 850 minus can now

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
well here's a chip panel

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and if we simply turn that over

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
here is 850 -10 and a trip T-minus now

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
is position then at now

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
equal to P and as we change the value to the

00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
to change the position this signal and now we multiply

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
these two together and integrate from minus infinity Department Kennedy

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
whip 850 minus now positioned at the appropriate value with T

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
well

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
again its best really to see this example and get the notion

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
love seek signal being flipped and the to think not flying past each other

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
multiplying in integrating by

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
looking at it dynamically and observing how the answer build-up

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
again the input that

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
we consider is a step input and again we use an impulse response

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
which is a decaying exponential and

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
to form the convolution we want the product

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
love accept an hour not with a chipped out but with a chip T-minus

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
now so we want HFT time reversed

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and then shifted appropriately depending on the value with T

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
let's first just look at age 50 -10 now

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
for T positive corresponding to shifting

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
a chip -10 now to the right and here we have

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TV increasing here

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
is TV decreasing and we

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
we want to begin the convolution with T negative

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
corresponding to shifting H A minus towel

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to the left now to form the convolution we want the product if these two

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and pretty negative there are no 90

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
contributions to the integral

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and so the convolution will be 0 party less than zero

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and the bottom trace we show the results of the convolution

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
here for T negative

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and pretty less than zero we will continue to have zero in the convolution

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
now as TV increases past

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
0 we begin to get some 90 contribution

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
in the product indicated by the fact that the convolution

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the result to the convolution starts to build-up

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and as see increases further

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we will get more and more 90 contribution

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
in the in a grand and so

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the resulted the convolution will be

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a monotonically increasing function for this particular example

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
which asymptotically approaches a constant

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and that constant will be proportional

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to the area under the impulse response because that the fact that work

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
involving

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
with the step input

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
now let's carry out the convolution with an input which is

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
a rectangular Paul's again an impulse response which is an exponential

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and so to form the convolution we want except now with a2

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
T-minus towel H A T minus now shown here for TE

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
negative and again to form the convolution we take

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the integral all the product if these two

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
which again will be 0 for

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
T less than zero so the bottom trace shows the result of the convolution

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
here shown is zero and it will continue to be 0

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
until T becomes positive at which point we build up

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
some 90 turn

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in the in a grant now as we slide further

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
until the impulse response

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
shifts outside the interval in which the polls

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is 90 the output will build up

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but here we've now begun to leave that interval

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and so the output will start to BK exponentially

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and as the impulse response

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
slides further and further corresponding to

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
increasing see then the output

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
will DK exponentially representing the fact

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that their is less and less area

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
in the product love except now

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and a chief T-minus now and asymptotically

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
this output will then approach 0 okay so

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you've seen convolution a you see the derivation of convolution and kinda the

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
graphical

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
representation convolution finally

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
let's work again with these two examples

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and let's go through those two examples analytically

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
so that we finally see how analytically

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the result develops for those same examples

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
well we have

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
first the discrete-time case and let's take our discrete-time example

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and and in general the convolution some

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
is as I indicated here so yes

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
is just our expression from before which is

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the convolution some and if we take our two examples

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the example love and it put which is

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
unit step and an impulse response

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
which is a real exponential multiplied by a unit step

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
we have then

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
replacing exit K by

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
what we know the input to be an HR then minus K

00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
by what we know the impulse response to be the output is

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the expression that we have here now

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
in this expression and you'll see this

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
of very generally and with the more complicated examples

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
when you look at the tax as

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
you go to evaluate these expressions

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
generally what happens is that the signals have different analytical

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
forms in different regions and that's a fact

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
what we have here your particular let's

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
look at the thumb and well we observed first the ball

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is that the

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
limits on this song are going to be modified

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
depending on where this unit step

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
is zero and non-zero in particular

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
if we first consider what will turn out to be the simple case

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
namely and less than zero for and less than zero

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
this unit step is

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
0 for K

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
greater than an and with an less than zero

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that means that this unit step never

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
is 90 for K

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
positive on the other hand

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
this unit step is never 90

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
or is always 0 for k negative

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
let me just stressed that by looking at the particular grabs

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
here is the unit step you FK

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
here is the units that you then minus K

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and for and less than zero so that this point comes before this point

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the product these two is equal to 0

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that means there is no overlap between these two terms

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and so it says that why I have an

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the output is 0 for and less than 0

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
well that was an easy one a her

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
bring greater than 0 it's not quite a straightforward

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
as coming out with the answers 0 so now

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
let's look at what happens when the two units steps overlap

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and this would correspond to

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
what i've labeled here as interval to namely for and greater than 0

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
if we just look back at the

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
summation that we had the summation now

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
corresponds to this unit step

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and this unit step having some overlap

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
so for interval to

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
corresponding to an greater than 0 we have

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
you have K the unit step

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
we have you love and minus K

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
which is a unit step going backward in time

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
by which extends

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
for positive values have an

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
if we think about multiplying these two together

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
we will get in the product unity

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
for what values at K well

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
for K starting at zero corresponding to one of the units steps

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
ending at hand corresponding to the other units that

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
so we have an overlap between these

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
for k equal to 0 et cetera

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
up through the value and

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
right now that means that in terms of the original some

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
we can get rid of the units steps involved by simply changing the limits

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
on the some

00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and the limits now are from zero

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to an the term

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
out for to the end minus K

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
we had before you with Cain you then minus K and that disappeared because

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
because we don't with that simply by modifying the limits

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
we now pull out the term output to the N

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
because the summation is on canine and so we can

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
simply poll that term

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
out at the some

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and we now have out but the minus K

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
which we can write rewrite as alpha to the minus 12 PK

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and the upshot of all of this is that why I have an

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
now we can really express as output to the end

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
its own from 0 to end up outfit to the -1

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to the K well question is how do we

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
evaluate that and

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it's essentially corresponds to a finite number

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
turns in a geometric series and that bio

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
by the way is estimation that will recur over and over and over and over again

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and it's one that you should right down right on your back pocket right in the

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
palm of your hand

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
or whatever it takes to remember it what you'll see is that that will recur

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
can more or less the throughout the course

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and so it's one worth remembering and in particular

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
what the storm love a geometric

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
series is is what i've indicated here

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
we have this song from 0 to our they did to the K

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and it's one minus beta to the are plus one

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
this is one more than the

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
upper limit on the summation and in the denominator is one minus beta

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so this equation is important

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
is no point in attempting to derive it however you get to it it's important

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
to retain okay well

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
we can now use that some Asian

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
in the expression that we just the ballot

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and so let's proceed to a value a tax on clothes

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
form so we now know go back

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
to the expression that we just worked out

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
why event is output to the end its own from 0 to N

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
output to the -1 to the K

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
this plays the role a beta in a turn that I just

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
in the expression and I just presented

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and so using

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
bat using that result we can rewrite this summation as i indicate here

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and the final result that we end up with

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
after a certain amount of algebra is

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
why I have an equal to one minus output to the end plus one

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
divided by one minus out for

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and let me just kinda vindicate with a few dots here

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
dead there is a certain amount of algebra required in going from

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
this step to this step and

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and I I'd like to leave you with the phone an opportunity you doing at your

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,000
leisure

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
okay well so so the expression we have now

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
for wired and is why I have an

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
equal to one myself up to be enforced one divided by one minus now for

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that bring greater than 0 we found out previously that it was 0 for and less

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
than 0

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and finally if we were to plot this what we would

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
get is the graph that I indicate here

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the first non-zero value occurs at an equal 0

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and it has a height 1 and then

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the next 90 value at one and this has a height

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
a one plus alpha and this is one place now for

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
on South squared and and

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the sequence continues on like that

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
an asymptotically approaches as n goes to infinity

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
asymptotically approaches one over one minute South for

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
which is consistent with the algebraic expression

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
that we have that we develop and obviously of course

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
is also consistent with the movie alright so that's our

00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
discrete-time example which we kinda went through graphically

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
with the transparencies and we went through graphically with the movie you

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
know we've gone through analytically

00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
now let's look analytically at

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the continuous-time example which pretty much

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
close in the same way as we've just gone through

00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
so again we have

00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the convolution integral which is

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the integral indicated at the top

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and our example you recall was with accepting as a unit step

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and a trip to the as

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
an exponential times the units that so

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
when we substitute those then this then corresponds to

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
exit to the and this corresponds to 850 -10 now

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and again we have the same

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
issue more last which is that inside that integral

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
there are two steps one of them going forward in time and one of them going

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
backward in time and we need to examine

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
when they overlap in when they don't when they don't overlap the product of

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
course is zero

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and there's no point doing any integration because the anagram 20

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
so if we track it through we have again

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
interval one which is to us$10,000

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
pretty less than zero this unit step

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
which only begins at: equals 0

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
a tally cool 0 and this unit step

00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
which is zero by the time

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
how gets up to TN beyond party less than zero

00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
is no overlap between

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
the unit step going forward in time

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
and the units that going backward in time and consequently

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
the in a grand is equal to 0 and consequently

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
the output is equal to 0 okay

00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
now we can

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
likewise looked at the interval where

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the to unit steps to overlap and in that case what happens again is that the

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
overlap

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
in essence the units that tells us gives us a range

00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
on the integration and in particular

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
the two-step overlap 20 is greater than

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
from how equal 0

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
two towers both T so

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
critical to party greater than 0

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
again of course we have in this expression

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this product love this unit step

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and this unit step is equal to 1

00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
in this rain

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and so that allows us then

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
to change the limits on the integral

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
mister from minus infinity two plus infinity

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
we know that the in a grand is non-zero only over this range

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
looking at this in to grow we can now pull out the term which corresponds to

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you need to the -80 just as we pulled out

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
a term in the discrete-time case

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and we noticed in the integral we have eat to the

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
-8 -10 now so that gives us the integral from 0 to TV to the eight-hour

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
and if we perform at integration

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
we end up with this expression

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and finally multiplying this by either the -80

00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
we have for y'at pretty greater than 0

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the algebraic expression that I

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
indicated on the bottom

00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
so so we had worked out

00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to less than zero and we come out 10

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
we work out take greater than 0 and we come out

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
with this algebraic expression

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and if we plot this out to rate expression as a function of time

00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
we find that what it corresponds to is

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
an exponential behavior starting at zero

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and exponentially heading asymptotically

00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
forward the bad you one over it

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
okay now we've gone through these examples several ways than one is

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
analytically

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
in order to develop a feel and fluency for convolution

00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
it's absolutely essential to work through a variety of examples

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
both understanding them graphically and understanding them as we did hear

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
analytically and you'll have an opportunity to do that

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
through the problems that I suggested in the video course manual

00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
in the next lecture what will turn to

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
are some general properties of convolution

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and show how this rather amazing representation

00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
when your time invariant systems in fact leads to a variety

00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
%uh properties linear time-invariant systems

00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and will find that convolution its

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
fairly rich in its properties and what this leads to

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
are some very nice and

00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
desirable and exploitable properties

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
linear time-invariant systems thank you
