00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
with all the run up time to the end of this why the confusion today and white women not more into the anthem

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:10,000
well I think it still isn't real for a lot of people and there is a lot of confusion is it your fault day I think we bear a part of the responsibility of not being able to get through a lot of the noise

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
what are the big concerns is that as a numbers been taught at they really don't know how things are going to fall in the middle class Mary Lee take it on the chin

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
middle class I would say depending on where that middle class employee work has been taking on the chin

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
when the person says this is the cost of your cable bill your cell phone bill that's not quite true

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what 6 out of 10 people will have the choice if they choose to make it the choice of a policy for under $100 the back end hurts it's a debate do you want to have

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
protection for basically every check up every visit everything that you do what do you have

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
as insulation where you are making a determination where you and your family don't use medical services at much you want to make sure you have protection

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is something really goes terribly wrong what is conceivable to you that the number of a 5000 to 6000 dollar deductible for middle class family

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is a reasonable feasible number well I think that families can make a budget Royce if that isn't something that clearly they can pay for a lot of people couldn't pay for that out of pocket on a lower deductible what does success look like

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
566 s looks like Ave at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014
