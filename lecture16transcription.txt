029130~002370~the
031500~007000~the in
038790~007000~the new the we concluded the last lecture
057580~004110~with the statement above the sampling theorem and just as a quick reminder
061690~003399~the sampling theorem said that
065089~003181~if we have a continuous-time signal
068270~003430~and we have equally spaced samples
071700~005760~all that signal sampled at a sampling period which a indicators capital T
077460~004409~and if except he is banned limited
081869~003681~in other words the forty a transformer 0
085550~003280~outside some band where Omega Sapan
088830~003280~is the highest frequency then
092110~005480~under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two-part divided by
097590~000949~the period
098539~003631~is greater than twice the highest frequency
102170~003910~the original signal is uniquely
106080~004870~recoverable from the set of samples and
110950~003599~the sampling theorem essentially was derived by
114549~003271~observing or using the notion that
117820~003299~sampling could be done by multiplication
121119~004610~or modulation with an impulse train and the sampling theorem develop
125729~003131~by examining the consequence
128860~004420~love the modulation property in the context of the Fourier transform
133280~004760~in particular if we have our signal accept T
138040~003390~and it's multiplied by an impulse train
141430~004130~to give us a sampled signal
145560~005920~another impose train whose values or areas are samples of the original time
151480~000690~function
152170~003879~as i indicate here then
156049~003881~in fact if we examine this equation or equivalently
159930~003059~bringing accept T inside this some
162989~005511~if we examine either if these equations in the frequency domain
168500~003260~the four EA transform love
171760~004760~exe PFT is the convolution
176520~004770~above the 40 a transformer the original signal and the Fourier transform
181290~003839~up the impulse train now
185129~003761~be imposed strain is a periodic signal its Fourier transform
188890~003980~therefore as we talked about with Fourier transforms itself an impulse
192870~000710~train
193580~003120~and when we do this convolution n
196700~004330~using the fact that the 48 race for the imposed strain
201030~003250~is an impulse train the result
204280~003810~or this convolution then tells us
208090~003280~that the 48 transform love
211370~003180~the sampled signal or the impulse train
214550~003909~which represents the samples is a some
218459~003860~love frequency shifted replications
222319~003071~up the 48 transform of the original signal
225390~003450~so mathematically
228840~004580~that's the relationship it essentially says that after sampling or modulation
233420~001459~with an impulse train
234879~003190~the resulting spectrum is the original spectrum
238069~003351~added to itself shifted by multiples
241420~003660~integer multiples of the sampling frequency well
245080~003489~let's see that as we did last time in terms of pictures
248569~003571~and again to remind you of the basic
252140~004129~picture involved if we have an original signal
256269~003171~with the spectrum is a indicated here where
259440~003349~its ban limited with the highest frequency Omega Savannah M
262789~004601~and if the time function is sample
267390~004480~so that in the frequency domain week involved this spectrum
271870~004000~with the spectrum shown below which is the
275870~004430~spectrum love the impulse train
280300~004020~the convolution if these true up these two
284320~003550~is then the Fourier transform or spectrum
287870~003720~love the sampled time function
291590~004150~and so thats what we end up with here
295740~004929~and then as you recall to recover the original time function
300669~004731~from this as long as these individual triangles don't overlap
305400~003400~to recover it just simply involves
308800~005000~passing the impulse train through a low-pass filter in effect
313800~004170~extracting just one of these replications
317970~003470~love the original spectrum
321440~003920~so the overall system
325360~004570~then for for doing the sampling and then
329930~004590~the reconstruction of the original signal from the samples
334520~003880~consists of multiplying the original time function
338400~003970~by an impulse train and that gives us
342370~003620~then the sampled signal
345990~003410~the Fourier transform I show here love the
349400~005380~original signal and after modulation with the impulse train
354780~003520~the resulting spectrum that we have is
358300~006179~that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency
364479~003000~and then finally to recover
367479~004621~the original signal or to generate a reconstructed signal
372100~004610~we then multiply this in the frequency domain
376710~003989~by the frequency response of an idea low-pass filter
380699~003181~and what that accomplishes forest and
383880~004379~is recovering the original signal
388259~004561~now in this picture an important point that I raise last time
392820~004060~relates to the fact dead in doing the reconstruction
396880~003530~well we've assumed is dead in replicating
400410~003250~these individual versions
403660~003400~0 the original signal
407060~003919~those replications don't overlap and sold by passing this through a low-pass
410979~001211~filter in fact
412190~003289~we can recover the original signal well
415479~003530~what that requires is that
419009~004421~this frequency Omega Savannah M be less than
423430~003739~this frequency and this frequency
427169~005141~is Omega so fast minus Omega serve them
432310~004380~and so what we require is dead the frequency Omega Sapan
436690~003900~be less than Omega cyb s minus Omega sed am
440590~005329~or equivalent Lee what we require is that the sampling frequency
445919~003411~be greater and twice the highest frequency
449330~004360~in the original signal now
453690~003340~if in fact that condition is violated
457030~003930~then we end up with a very important effect
460960~003859~and that effect is referred to as a leasing
464819~004611~in particular if we look back at are
469430~003459~original example we're here
472889~004691~we were able to recover our original spectrum by
477580~003500~low-pass filtering if in fact
481080~003570~the sampling frequency is
484650~003280~not high enough to avoid aliasing
487930~004709~then what happens in that case is that the individual replications
492639~006271~love the Fourier transform above the stove the original signal
498910~003050~overlap and what we end up with
501960~005840~is some distortion as you can see if we tried to pass this through a low-pass
507800~001530~filter
509330~005119~to recover the original signal in fact we won't recover the original signal
514449~003911~since these individual replications have overlapped
518360~005040~and this is the case where Omega service minus Omega Savannah is less than
523400~004540~Omega so vast in other words the sampling frequency is not greater
527940~004180~in this case than twice the highest frequency
532120~003850~so what happens here then is that in effect
535970~004530~higher frequencies get folded down into lower frequencies what would come out of
540500~001630~the low-pass filter
542130~004260~is the reflection of some higher frequencies into lower frequencies
546390~003449~as I suggested a minute ago that affect
549839~003951~is referred to as alias saying and in order to
553790~005220~both understand that term better and two understand in fact the effect better
559010~004269~it's useful to examine this a little more closely
563279~004481~for the specific example a sinusoidal signal
567760~003699~so let's concentrate on that and what we want to look at
571459~004041~is the effect or alias saying
575500~004390~when our input signal is a sinusoidal signal
579890~003449~now to do that what I wanna show shortly
583339~003141~is a computer-generated movie
586480~003380~that we've made and let's first walk-through
589860~005030~a few frames a bit to give you our first of all
594890~003600~to to set up our notation and to suggest what it is that we're trying to
598490~002060~demonstrate
600550~005500~well what we have is an input signal
606050~003030~is a sinusoidal signal and
609080~003379~the spectrum or for a transformer that
612459~003101~is an impulse in the frequency domain at
615560~003219~the frequency the sinusoid we then
618779~004421~have samples love that and when we sample that in for this particular
623200~002880~example its sample the 10 killer hurts
626080~003830~this spectrum is then replicated
629910~003739~at multiples all the sampling frequency
633649~004201~and I haven't shown negative frequencies here but the contribution do
637850~003280~to the negative frequency
641130~005540~is at 10 killer hurts minus the input sinusoid
646670~003120~we then carry out a reconstruction
649790~005359~with an idea low-pass filter and the ideal ok pass filter is set at
655149~003301~half the sampling frequency or five kelleher its
658450~003040~so what we have then is
661490~004500~the input signal accept T
665990~003860~and the impulse train exe PFT
669850~003299~and then the reconstructed signal is
673149~003250~the output from the low-pass filter
676399~004701~which I denote as X a party
681100~003049~now as the input frequency X 50
684149~004130~increases this impulse moves up in frequency
688279~003851~but this impulse moves down in frequency
692130~005050~and so let's just look at a few frames as the input frequency increases
697180~003399~so we have here a case
700579~003101~where the input frequency has move up
703680~003050~close to five killer hurts
706730~004060~as we continue further these two impossible's
710790~003840~will cross and what we'll end up with as i indicated
714630~003680~is aliasing so here now is a case
718310~003300~where we have alias saying the
721610~004360~replication of the negative frequency has crossed into the passband if the
725970~001130~filter
727100~003890~and the reconstructed sinusoid will now
730990~003839~be the frequency associated with this impulse
734829~003161~rather than the frequency Associated
737990~004630~with the original sinusoid and to dramatize that
742620~003250~even further here is
745870~003950~the example where now the input frequency
749820~003209~has moved up close to 10 killer hurts
753029~003081~but what comes out of the low-pass filter
756110~003460~is a much lower frequency and in fact
759570~003949~you can see that here is the reconstructed sinusoid
763519~005320~whereas here we have the input size
768839~003120~okay well now what I'm gonna wanna do is
771959~004961~demonstrate this as i indicated with a computer-generated movie
776920~003789~and well we'll see is the effect
780709~004440~on the effect of reconstructing
785149~003011~from the samples using a low-pass filter
788160~004200~for an input which changes in frequency
792360~003360~and with the sampling rate of 10 killer hurts
795720~003340~and what we'll see in the first part of this movie is
799060~003680~the input except the and the reconstructed signal
802740~004500~X a party without explicitly showing the samples
807240~003849~and then at a later point will also show this and indicate
811089~003401~that in fact the samples are those two are equal even though
814490~003070~they themselves are not
817560~004339~so at the top will have the input sinusoid without
821899~003031~showing the samples and its
824930~005580~for EA transform is an impulse in the frequency domain as we've indicated
830510~005170~and if we sample it that imposed and gets replicated
835680~003180~and so samples in particular
838860~003469~will have a Fourier transform not only with an impulse
842329~004911~at the input sinusoid sinusoidal frequency but also attend killer hurts
847240~001990~minus that frequency
849230~005320~now for the reconstruction we pass the samples through an idea low-pass filter
854550~000820~I picked
855370~003990~the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter at half the sampling frequency
859360~002180~namely 5 killer hurts
861540~003109~and here we see is that the output
864649~004880~reconstructed signal in fact matches in frequency the input signal
869529~003731~now as we change the input frequency
873260~003699~the reconstructed sinus so it is identical
876959~004051~until we get to an input frequency
881010~003460~which exceeds half the sampling frequency
884470~005669~at that point we have aliasing and while the input frequency is increasing
890139~004591~the output frequency in fact is decreasing
894730~004210~because that's what's inside the passband the filter
898940~006110~now let's sweep it back and as the input frequency decreases the output frequency
905050~001140~increases
906190~003740~till there's no aliasing and now the output reconstructed
909930~004390~signal is equal to the input
914320~003870~so we sample the signal and then reconstructed
918190~003759~the signal from the samples and keep in mind
921949~004721~that given a set of samples there are lots of continuous curves that we can
926670~001969~thread through the set of samples
928639~004021~the one that we picked up cores is the one consistent
932660~003239~with the assumption about the signal band with
935899~003101~in particular we've reconstructed the signal
939000~005420~that who spectrum falls within the pass band at the filter
944420~003969~now what I'd like to show is the same
948389~003181~reconstruction and input as I showed before
951570~003540~but now let's look at the samples and what we'll see is that
955110~003469~when there's alias saying even though
958579~003450~the output the reconstructed signal
962029~003651~is not identical to the input in fact
965680~004140~it's consistent with the input samples that is sampling the reconstructed
969820~001759~signal
971579~003560~gives a set of samples identical to the samples at the input
975139~004070~and it's just that the interpolation in between those samples
979209~003091~is an interpolation consistent with you soon
982300~003640~fan with love the input based on the sampling there
985940~003009~so let's now look at that with
988949~004760~the samples also shown along with the sinusoid
993709~004761~so at the top we have the input sinusoid together with its samples
998470~004380~the bottom traces the Fourier transform of the sampled waveform
1002850~003580~the middle trace is the reconstructed
1006430~005110~sinusoid together with its samples and notice of course that the samples are
1011540~002099~the input a reconstructed signal
1013639~003281~are identical and also
1016920~003520~the input sinusoidal frequency
1020440~004519~and the output sinus or frequency are identical
1024959~004450~we now increase the frequency at the input
1029409~003750~the reconstructed sinusoid tracks the input frequency
1033159~003811~and of course the samples are the two are identical
1036970~003830~the interpolation in between the samples is identical
1040800~004029~because the fact dead the input frequency is still
1044829~006681~less than half the sampling frequency
1051510~005639~and so as long as the input is frequency is less than half the sampling frequency
1057149~003541~not only will the samples be identical but also
1060690~003530~the reconstructed continuous waveform will match
1064220~007000~the input way for
1076820~003120~now when we get to hear the sampling frequency were just
1079940~003030~on the verge Bailey is saying this isn't alias saying
1082970~003640~quite yet but any increase in the input frequency
1086610~004640~will now generate aliasing we now have a leasing
1091250~004179~the output frequency is lower than the input frequency but notice
1095429~004771~that the samples are identical now
1100200~004040~the low-pass filter is interpolating in between those samples
1104240~004730~with a sinusoid that falls within the past Pandev the low-pass filter
1108970~005580~which no longer matches the frequency of the input sinusoid but
1114550~003860~the important point is that even when we have alias saying
1118410~003330~the samples are the reconstructed waveform
1121740~003100~are identical to the samples
1124840~005700~of the original way for and notice that as the input frequency increases
1130540~004230~in fact the interpolated output the reconstructed output
1134770~007000~has decreased in frequency now as the input frequency begins to get closer to
1141770~003480~10 killer hurts in fact you're all I
1145250~003130~tends to also interpolate between the samples
1148380~003870~with a frequency that is lower
1152250~003090~day and the input frequency NS particularly evident
1155340~003830~here notice that the input samples in fact
1159170~003050~look like they would be associated
1162220~003810~with a much lower frequency sinusoid then in fact
1166030~004320~was the sinusoid the generated a lower frequency sinusoid
1170350~005329~in fact corresponds to the reconstructed one now as we sit back down
1175679~005081~the aliasing eventually disappears and the output sinus or tracks the input
1180760~001310~sinusoid in frequency
1182070~003730~so we've seen the
1185800~004030~effective aliasing for sinusoidal signals and turns away forms
1189830~003880~now let's hear how it sounds now
1193710~003500~what we have for this demonstration is
1197210~003320~an oscillator and
1200530~003880~a sampler and the output of the sampler
1204410~003440~goes into a low-pass filter so the
1207850~005280~input for from the oscillator goes into the sampler
1213130~003010~and the output the sampler
1216140~003460~goes into the low-pass filter the
1219600~003209~sampler frequency is 10 killer hurts
1222809~003431~and so the low-pass filter
1226240~003910~has a cutoff frequency as i indicate here
1230150~003430~all five killer hurts and
1233580~003020~what will listened to is the
1236600~003680~reconstructed output as the
1240280~003680~oscillator input frequency berries
1243960~004170~and recall there what should happen is that
1248130~005179~when the oscillator input frequency gets past half the sampling frequency
1253309~005921~we should hear aliasing so we'll start the oscillator it to kill her ex
1259230~003230~and keep in mind that what you see on the dial
1262460~004400~is the input frequency which you here is the output frequency
1266860~003670~as long as the input frequency is less than half the sampling frequency in
1270530~001600~other words 5 killer hurts
1272130~003870~the reconstructed signal sounds identical to the input
1276000~003510~now at five still hurts were right
1279510~005090~on the verge of aliasing and when we increase the input frequency past five
1284600~000880~killer hurts
1285480~003550~the reconstructed frequency in fact will decrease
1289030~003850~so as we move for example from 5 killer hurts
1292880~003190~up to let's say 6 killer hurts
1296070~003040~sick still hurts in fact yes alias
1299110~003960~down to what gets alias down to
1303070~003260~4 killer us so
1306330~003920~6 go over to the input is for killer hurts
1310250~003930~at the output now if we move up even further
1314180~003960~7 kilohertz at the end pushed its alias down
1318140~003660~to three killer hurts at the outpost
1321800~004420~so bad dan is a audio demonstration and aliasing
1326220~003120~so to summarize
1329340~003350~if we sample signal and then reconstruct
1332690~004730~from the samples using a low-pass filter as long as the sampling frequency is
1337420~002730~greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal
1340150~003460~we reconstruct exactly if on the other hand
1343610~004400~the sampling frequency is too low less than twice the highest frequency
1348010~003250~then we get alias saying in other words
1351260~003890~higher frequencies get folded or reflected
1355150~003310~down into lower frequencies as they come through the low-pass filter
1358460~003660~now wanted the
1362120~004140~common applications love the whole concept of sampling
1366260~006120~is the use sampling to convert a continuous-time signal into a
1372380~003140~discrete-time signal to carry out
1375520~003820~what's often referred to as discreet I processing
1379340~005080~of continuous-time signals and this in fact is something that will be talking
1384420~000660~about
1385080~003480~in a fair amount of detail beginning with the next lecture
1388560~003620~but and let me indicate that for
1392180~003580~that kinda processing essentially what happens
1395760~003610~is dead we begin with a continuous-time signal
1399370~003340~and convert it to a discrete-time signal
1402710~003640~carry out the discrete-time processing and then
1406350~003560~convert back to continuous-time and
1409910~004750~the conversion from a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time
1414660~003010~signal in fact is done
1417670~003990~by exploiting sampling specifically
1421660~003250~by sampling the continuous-time signal
1424910~003190~with an impulse train and then
1428100~003490~converting the impulse train into
1431590~004450~a sequence in a manner that all talk about in more detail
1436040~003300~next time now in doing that
1439340~004080~of course as you can imagine it's important since we want
1443420~004040~an accurate representation of the original continuous-time signal
1447460~004620~to choose the sampling frequency to very carefully avoid aliasing
1452080~003560~and so in fact in that context
1455640~003390~and in many other contexts alias saying is something
1459030~003350~that we're very eager to avoid however
1462380~003320~it's also important to understand that alias saying
1465700~004870~isn't all bad and there are some very specific contexts in which
1470570~004390~alias saying is very useful and very heavily exploited
1474960~003170~one example love
1478130~004150~a very useful context valia saying is when
1482280~003310~you want to look at things that happen at frequencies
1485590~004620~that you can't look at for one reason or another and sampling in a leasing is
1490210~002440~used to map those into lower frequencies
1492650~005230~one very common example of that is the use of the stroboscopic
1497880~003870~which was invented by doctor how their chechen
1501750~004530~at MIT and sometime earlier in fact we had
1506280~004820~the opportunity to visit doctor Richard ins laboratory at MIT
1511100~004210~and see some examples of this so I'd like to
1515310~003710~at as a conclusion to this lecture take you
1519020~005830~on visit to the stroke where and MIT
1524850~003220~in the lecture in discussing aliasing we've stressed
1528070~005870~the fact that in most situations it's something that would like to avoid
1533940~004010~however right now we're at MIT and stroll Valley
1537950~004010~as it's called on the way to visit the laboratory
1541960~003070~Mike MIT colleague Professor are alleged
1545030~004410~where in fact a leasing is an everyday occurrence
1549440~003880~basically the idea is to follow dead
1553320~003220~it in fact you wanna make measurements
1556540~003460~at frequencies that for one reason or another
1560000~005480~you can't measure their sampling and consequently aliasing
1565480~004750~can be used to bring those frequencies down into a frequency range that you can
1570230~001990~measure
1572220~003170~well professor edgerton alias
1575390~003920~da kitchen invented the strokes call
1579310~004140~for exactly that reason and kinda the idea is the fall
1583450~004600~the I essentially is a low pass filter and so there are things that happen
1588050~003270~at frequencies boat which
1591320~003470~your I contract and by
1594790~004650~sampling with light poles sampling in time
1599440~004610~what in effect you're able to do is sample in such a way
1604050~003030~that higher frequencies get alias
1607080~004570~down to lower frequencies then factor I contract
1611650~003770~so let's take the look inside the where
1615420~003530~and in fact see no aspiration or
1618950~006310~the scroll and some its effects
1625260~004750~will be here introduce you to my mighty colleague I kitchen
1630010~004350~in also by the way he this is a great place for kids of all ages
1634360~004020~and so my daughter just insisted on coming along to
1638380~003340~also helped out stock need you we could begin with you
1641720~004360~just saying a little bit about what the strobe is in with some history is
1646080~004150~steroids ring resemble an increase in a min ly
1650230~003740~misses them losing on Lampson
1653970~003800~prices litter control rate planning on
1657770~003650~school is not a good strategy is going to turn and we're going to look at.
1661420~003230~motor striving on balance weight
1664650~003470~to set up some rhinos lesions in the spring
1668120~003760~want to know more bring on the throne
1671880~007000~by
1679960~007000~by
1690580~001130~you writer and
1691710~007000~throbs but just in the frequency the way
1700019~005931~but corresponds to North influencer little more elusive
1705950~004030~for the facts thought maybe we could the turn the stroller
1709980~003809~for a minute noon the but let me
1713789~003811~point out the by the way there the fact that
1717600~003970~when looking at this without the strong mind always say essentially
1721570~004030~our frequencies that are I can attract so you can see the motor
1725600~001669~turning and
1727269~004500~we can really see other than then with the were we can see the movie the spring
1731769~003671~and so I get your point is that when we put the strobe on
1735440~004339~who were essentially sampling this and no
1739779~003551~you brought this stand with a frequency that there the
1743330~003319~Riza with the track in fact
1746649~003311~the I guess if we turn the
1749960~004209~incandescent light of loon
1754169~003110~the able to really bring out
1757279~005120~are the alias frequency so now we're what we're looking at in fact are the
1762399~004191~the earliest frequencies the street courses moving a lot faster than we see
1766590~000769~it in their ranks
1767359~003250~you know that's going on arena
1770609~003461~30 times second Bruins are
1774070~003859~thirties and second occurs through the survivors include
1777929~003930~next move Rohingya figure 8a. saying you don't see that
1781859~005540~yeah friend
1787399~007000~well we'll be seeing now is essentially second harmonic that
1804899~003160~someone okay
1808059~003021~and just do you think you can make this spring dance around a little bit
1811080~005319~find taking this slow frequency soon as all around
1816399~003510~okay it's really neat let's turn the lights back on
1819909~003281~weekend this is Charles president with anything 3 I'm
1823190~004839~yeah has the third what's interesting now if we look at this and
1828029~003150~seeking a fifth just rolled off again
1831179~005860~earth okay noticed just think we look at the spring man although we can see is a
1837039~000561~blur
1837600~003600~and really can't see because you're right here tracking
1841200~004919~can see things happening station but he said
1846119~003711~by the way this was written demonstrated at the World's Fair
1849830~002570~the thickness
1852400~002999~world because glasses
1855399~004190~for their Wow a loses all dressed up
1859589~003090~element using
1862679~004011~break bring bruises
1866690~004199~fine but failed I stick with the miners stresses
1870889~003330~runners or have break
1874219~003710~bum they work on automobiles
1877929~007000~their own thoughts on the vibrate but let's
1885009~003650~earth buy levitra run this for a lot more than half an hour or a liberal
1888659~004941~name is continues
1893600~001380~terms
1894980~003220~thing me maybe we can look at the
1898200~003079~a couple other things have a about the fam
1901279~004661~brand the classic buzzed
1905940~003699~that's a good idea makes too much noise
1909639~005350~ok is to remove that over here that's just an ordinary like the fam
1914989~003621~has a mark on one plate surgeon
1918610~007000~identify you can get up to speed
1929180~003010~know that this looks like a phantom was also demonstrated in the
1932190~003680~world's fair few years ago yeah kinda been
1935870~003600~been does a movie
1939470~004110~quicken awake practicing in to and it was very fan
1943580~003490~well one like it happened if the reform do
1947070~005050~MGM and the Peters B Smith
1952120~003560~wanted he said he won miss royale up
1955680~004820~custard pie into it not don't know I'm a serious scientists for
1960500~003700~sizes compromise on a I
1964200~004200~so we dropped an egg into it in the news UCI's B-movie
1968400~004780~dropping 0 not known struggle there there was with the
1973180~003700~high-speed great remove yeah it's okay so
1976880~003850~so again I guess without this true when we look at its
1980730~003530~what we're looking at our frequencies it are
1984260~003940~much higher than the I think following now with the stroke blindness
1988200~003970~you can see both the alias frequency and you can also see the original frequency
1992170~000860~because we have the
1993030~003500~investment line sweats I'm let's
1996530~003120~turned down the the background lighting and
1999650~003400~stand then really all that were able to see or the aliasing
2003050~003410~frequencies stand I guess
2006460~003050~I guess when we see more than one market means that the
2009510~003450~stay were actually running its and
2012960~003350~or guns is more and more things the the using
2016310~004770~lower radiation steroids because the plans aren't exactly the same
2021080~004060~actually this gives me a chance illustrating other important correlated
2025140~000930~to the lecture
2026070~003040~I'll that they could bring them to frequency
2029110~007000~so that re only get one more scorched
2036340~003210~missus begins to move this is just one way there now
2039550~005030~okay so so the way we have now we've essentially alias the fan speed and so
2044580~000480~the
2045060~004050~is just a little higher than the seeds and now
2049110~005710~on right at the sea and now if I could and just a little further in fact that
2054820~003050~looks like the fans turning back hurts
2057870~003170~and if you think that this into context the leasing
2061040~004780~its it's like this to impulses in the frequency domain
2065820~004320~crossover in with you get an effective you and was mathematically
2070140~003280~you get a phase reversed in
2073420~004320~no wasn't so I E I first understood have a leasing
2077740~004570~with Doc understood why stand with the western movies
2082310~004420~a everyone's Ryan see the wagon wheels through November go backwards train and
2086730~001160~there's there the
2087890~003710~wagon wheels in western movie going backwards yes stressed
2091600~004910~and just see what you see is %um too much weaker on straight up so you get to
2096510~003160~just see greater frequency of so that's
2099670~003560~you get to marched
2103230~004800~u-turn and Justin's governor and you think tourist
2108030~003050~you impressed
2111080~003790~schoolroom its regular spirits
2114870~004110~all rights pictures in your honor older adults
2118980~004620~and I rising price revolution I guess another thing is that this demonstrates
2123600~001020~something that is
2124620~005000~and I heard a long time ago which is its should never use a power so with the
2129620~004790~fluorescent lights the is arrest like is a little bit of a stroke affecting
2134410~004460~you could actually can misuse of that standing still make mistakes a
2138870~003940~strength that you think everything we are doing is a good friend of
2142810~003310~no I don't think I want to try it out how are you this do you think that's
2146120~003430~any sores and wounds she knows it's going
2149550~003250~sproule undergoing closest friends okay let's
2152800~003770~I'm actually we turn the lights back on again what's
2156570~004320~their latest see once again is that we can see both the alias frequencies going
2160890~001070~to you that's
2161960~003440~and we we can also see the higher frequencies because the
2165400~004130~incandescent lighting its okay maybe we can be no
2169530~003090~is parents take a look at some other
2172620~003880~on things and when I guess I'm curious about is the distance you have over
2176500~000910~their kids
2177410~003770~doc maybe you can tell us what we have here
2181180~003120~churros the this to show
2184300~003940~how you can get motion pictures on a Susan still pictures
2188240~003800~the circle is repeated 12 times
2192040~003820~why does outer part over mmm on this site
2195860~004530~in part on the other quiet place one time for a revolution on this
2200390~004490~you see the exactly as it is if I skip one picture each time
2204880~003000~when you get there relative motions
2207880~003270~mall the object is to show the ball rotating
2211150~004370~is this where that one depending on mood straw was going faster or slower
2215520~005260~and the other Uzan this way motion pictures went well
2220780~004190~100 years school long for photography drew pictures of people
2224970~004880~different animated features like the run yes great
2229850~006430~is actually the title kinda busy aliasing can be fun conservatism
2236280~003180~sterling if the speeds
2239460~003730~or away if you get a lot of different things sorted veterans
2243190~003700~go through ruin currently reaches speeds
2246890~004450~reserve a room in the rules it sounds
2251340~004310~ok and the background blur basically the high frequencies the I can't follow
2255650~004040~and and then we're going to propose and then again we can see
2259690~003340~frequencies it really is down the nets
2263030~004380~rookie I ends right now I am one place for revolution sleep
2267410~003260~see the corner the move is consuming records
2270670~004100~exactly the reasons there are an increasing frequency
2274770~005960~of risk if 100 one server or early get the illusion that diamonds
2280730~004250~room in fact let's a let's really enhanced solution
2284980~004140~Western the incandescent lights off
2289120~003710~and now now are we seeing really you're the alias frequencies
2292830~004510~or or do you think this just adds
2297340~004680~looks like reading recognized through was doing rejoining licensing
2302020~003800~of is the same rules now lower watching is something also
2305820~003230~might point out of a for the
2309050~003530~I'm the lecture for the course is that actually there
2312580~003240~there really are two sampling frequencies receiving one is this road
2315820~000940~and
2316760~003740~which is the stroke that you're running the other is the inherent
2320500~003900~Creamery for the TV that's running at 30 frames a second
2324400~003530~and that's won the reasons by the way in dead people watching this
2327930~003740~on the video worst are in fact seeing
2331670~004260~Flickr or a feeding or modulation between
2335930~004270~the two on synchronize frame rates runner grievances
2340200~006760~grow up so we get to of to a room credits
2346960~003030~of to
2349990~007000~roaming two runs on each other of
2357980~001250~of
2359230~003590~you know it senator Reid's learning this
2362820~003650~soon living room when all your friends
2366470~003870~I think would be a good terrific homered problem getting video Kors
2370340~003470~they have them all sit down and analyze all the frequencies that they're seeing
2373810~002299~and what they're being alias through the evening event
2376109~003031~it's a good view run the teacher I love you
2379140~003210~who is great yeah remember these dudes list
2382350~003240~I think that a chase a few people away from the courses good
2385590~004170~cracks and you get you get involved in these offerings
2389760~004460~rule ruler and what you can do for a KMS roots
2394220~003350~let's bring you the incandescent lights back again
2397570~003690~just to remind everybody that in back row this or
2401260~003470~some some frequencies that are a lot higher than the ones that
2404730~003170~we begin to get the impression that we're watching just the
2407900~003620~motor running Frances Bean pattern on
2411520~003900~long Dhaka have to
2415420~003060~I have to say that there are many people I know they have as much fun in the work
2418480~000650~as you do
2419130~004100~home like a man arm quote would but I'd like to
2423230~004260~do now baby is take a look at one last experiment sure did
2427490~004260~and what I'd like to do is a.m. is go take a look at the
2431750~003020~I guess what sometimes is called the home
2434770~003500~well not the water graphics for men with thin air the minute dole pillar
2438270~003320~hydraulic everything that's the 1i was thinking and let's take a look over
2441590~000440~there
2442030~007000~okay one just in this Go internal war so
2449500~003170~your doc this is the what did you got DP
2452670~003890~HHM bird double peddler hydraulic
2456560~003450~happening machine Gary okay then it's a.m. so please
2460010~003020~it looks like continues dream up it is not its
2463030~005150~pump over there something sixty post second so those owners
2468180~003720~coming out in spurts %uh so actually again it's
2471900~003090~it's the the sixty boss is the second year I can follow
2474990~003540~your eyes so is exactly basically looks like a blur
2478530~003640~ruseler it is a blur writers you learn output stroll on
2482170~006820~okay grace start so again
2488990~003420~I guess we have this a essentially alias then in
2492410~004190~and again with the incandescent light you can see both sky high frequency
2496600~003610~and the alias frequency its and
2500210~004510~but see I guess that's with the frequency close to the sea and we can
2504720~004370~adjusted so that is stop stop bothering me going to go out and then we can
2509090~001110~actually make it go up
2510200~003710~scored anybody who is this South
2513910~004430~yeah effect movie have just just again due to stress this point to the
2518340~004250~class the the kind of the idea here the face reversal of course
2522590~003390~you can see it in the time domain Chynoweth you just think about when the
2525980~001010~flashes of light
2526990~003330~come but if you think I love kind of these
2530320~003789~impulses that we have in the frequency domain
2534109~004551~and we're aliasing as we change the sampling frequency what happens is that
2538660~001920~these impulses crossover
2540580~004200~and what that means is that we get a phase reversal the pending
2544780~003500~on which faces are associated with
2548280~003950~which side up the sea so that's kind of the idea the phase reversal
2552230~003320~okay let's the let's turn the
2555550~003540~against because it is important thing in between those who got
2559090~003420~yeah let's let's turn the incandescent light of first and
2562510~004020~think one thing your so 103 know through this thing you think you can do to get
2566530~002680~on the other side you're on hand so we can see with
2569210~005010~when for the UN intervening sleuths
2574220~004010~water there all the time well on a nosedive it seems to me if we can't we
2578230~001360~just the justices
2579590~005260~the that's just go through to next year staff the dots can do it just seeing how
2584850~001700~come you think your finger in the air
2586550~004240~fun to try once more its
2590790~003660~I get snyder et that's one thing we can do this
2594450~003270~well as bring the lights back up and its
2597720~004570~again just to go stress the point scary RTC
2602290~004400~there we are at a frequency that it's just a little above the sea
2606690~004890~and we can go back there and in the sea and we can actually get a phase reversal
2611580~004240~and I guess if we do this long enough we get at the at the whole ocean and put it
2615820~000769~back in
2616589~003161~we're ever comes from is there in cars in newsrooms gonna run is not running
2619750~003830~too long by the Rev trailer get here yet to be careful as well as the Moody Blues
2623580~000660~V
2624240~004980~surface well I don't know about them but I guess I believe you back its
2629220~003180~up a little more pressure on three gods monarchy
2632400~003350~Adams girlfriends or service teams
2635750~005350~going things together Ste
2641100~004489~we have these machines are all over the place lot of fun
2645589~003051~but that this this is really terrific I i think that
2648640~003370~the this whole idea of the
2652010~003210~and abusing aliens saying in stroz and
2655220~004380~the kinds of things that did you do with the murder just fantastic in that we
2659600~001630~really appreciate the chance to
2661230~004080~come in here and see the demonstration Rose Bowl game ruth's
2665310~003520~hope you will use it for years the bar over many years to come
2668830~003279~so is I emphasized that the beginning
2672109~003921~in what situations aliasing can in fact be very useful
2676030~004740~also with this demonstrates is that particularly when you have a colleague
2680770~001380~like da kitchen
2682150~004030~a leasing and for that matter science in general can be an awful lot of fun
2686180~007000~by gonna thanks a lot that again and thank you just the name
2694280~005640~well I have to say that that visit was an awful lot of fun for me and
2699920~004410~for Justin in fact to for the whole camera crew that was
2704330~004810~there and hopefully you all have used at some point will also have a chance to
2709140~004060~visited stroll Valley well
2713200~003180~hopefully what we've gone through today gives you
2716380~004140~a good feeling for the concepts love sampling an alias saying
2720520~005370~and both why it might be useful and why we might want to avoid
2725890~003210~in the next lecture will continue on
2729100~003180~the discussion of sampling any particular
2732280~003650~what all be talking about is the interpretation
2735930~004710~love the reconstruction process not in the frequency domain
2740640~004140~but in a time-domain interpretation specifically associated
2744780~003630~with the concept %uh interpolating between the samples
2748410~004650~well then proceed from there too a discussion as i've alluded to
2753060~004000~in several lectures love what i've referred to as
2757060~003770~discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals
2760830~005259~very heavily exploiting the concept and issues associated with sample
2766089~000331~thank you
