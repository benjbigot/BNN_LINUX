the

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the in

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the norm

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
are

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the in the last two lectures

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and we saw how periodic not periodic signals could be represented as linear

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
combinations a complex exponentials

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and this led to the Fourier series representation

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in the periodic case and it led to the Fourier transform

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
representation in the a periodic case and and then in fact

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
what we did was to incorporate the 4e a series

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
within the framework of the Fourier transform what I'd like to do in today's

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
lecture is

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
look at the 4-yard transform more closely

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
in particular with regard to so this property's

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
so let me begin by reminding you

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
love the analysis and synthesis equations for the four th

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
transform and as I summarize them here

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the synthesis equation being a

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
an equation that tells us how to build the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
time function outta in essence a linear combination

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
a complex exponentials and the analysis equation

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
telling us how to get the amplitudes love those complex exponentials

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
from the Associated time function

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so essentially in the decomposition

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
affect safety as a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the complex amplitudes if those are in effect

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the 48 transform scaled by

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the differential and scaled by one over two-part

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
now as

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I indicated last time the 48 transform

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
is a complex function of frequency in

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and in particular the complex function of frequency

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
has an important and very useful cemetery property

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the symmetry love the Fourier transform

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
when X if T is real is

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
what is referred to as conjugate symmetric in other words if we take the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
complex

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
function after Omega and and its complex conjugate

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that's equivalent to replacing Omega

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
by minus Omega and a consequence if that

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if we think interns love the real party the Fourier transform

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the real part is and even function of frequency

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and the magnet to is an even function of frequency

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
whereas the imaginary part is an

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
odd function of frequency and the phase angle

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is an odd function of frequency so

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
we have this symmetry relationship that for except the real

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
if we think I've either the real part or the magnitude of the Fourier transform

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
its even symmetric and the imaginary part

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
or the phase angle either one it is

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
fought symmetric in other words if we flip it we multiply by a minus sign

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
let's didn't look at an example

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in the context love an example that we worked last time

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
for the Fourier transform we took

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the case both a real exponential

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
love the form eat to the -80 times this step

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the 48 transform as

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we found was other algebraic form one over a plus J Omega

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and incidently the 48 transform into grow only converged

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
for a greater than 0 in other words

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
for this exponential became and I illustrated

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the magnitude and angle and what we see is that

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you the minus 8c is a real

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
time function therefore its magnitude

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
should be an even function of frequency and indeed it is

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and its phase angle shown below

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
is and odd function of frequency

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
so in fact in although

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I stressed last time that

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
the complex exponentials required to build the time function

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
require exponentials both positive and negative frequencies

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
for except the real what we see is that

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
because if the symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
magnitude and angle

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we can specify a before you transform for let's say only positive frequencies

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and asymmetry then implies are tells us

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
what the Fourier transform then will be for the negative frequencies

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
okay now this same example the cause

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the decaying exponential demonstrates

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
another important and often useful

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
property the Fourier transform

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
specifically let's rewrite algebraically this example

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
as I indicate here so we have

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
again the exponential was 48 transformers one over a plus J Omega

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and if I A just simply divide numerator and denominator by a

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can rewrite it in the form shown here

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and what we notice is dead in the time function

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
we have a term of the form eight times TV

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and in the frequency function we have a term for the form Omega

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
divided by a or

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
equivalent Lee we can't think all the

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
time function which I show here

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and as the pram enter a gets smaller

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the exponential gets spread out in time

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
whereas s04e08 transform

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
or the magnitude of its Fourier transform has the inverse property

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that as a get smaller in fact

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this scales down in frequency

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
well this is a general property love

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the Fourier transform namely the fact

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that a a linear scaling a time

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
generates the infers linear scaling a frequency

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and the general statement love this time frequency scaling is what

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I show at the top above the transparency namely the equation

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that if we scale the time function in time

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
then we apply and infers scaling a frequency

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
now her this in fact is probably a result

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that you're already possibly familiar with in

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
somewhat of a different context essentially you can think of this

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
as an example poor generalization rather

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
up the notion that if let's say I A

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
had a signal that was recorded on a tape player

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and if I play the tape back and let's say twice the speed which means that I'm

00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
compressing the time axis

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
linearly by a factor of two then in fact what happens is that

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the frequencies that we observe get pushed up by a factor of two

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and effect let me illustrate that

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have here a glockenspiel

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and anyone who loves a parade certainly knows what I each

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
blockage feel as and

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
this particular glockenspiel has

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
3 eighties separated each by an active there's a middle way

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
a high a us and a low a

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and what I've done is to record

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the middle a on a tape

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
at seven and a half inches per second and

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
what I'd like to demonstrate is that as

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
we play that back either a cloister half-speed

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the effective note gets moved down or up by a doctor

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
so let me first play the note at

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the speed at which was recorded and so what we'll hear

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is the middle a as i've recorded it and let me just start

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the tape player

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
okay let me stop it and hopefully what you heard is the

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
same note from the tape recorder as

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
the note that I played on the glockenspiel okay well now

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
a rewind the tape and we go back to the beginning

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
love that portion and

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
now if I change the tapes the to

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
half the speed so from seven and a half inches per second

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
a change the tape speed 233 quarter

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
inches per second and now

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
when I play the tape back because effect because

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
love the inverse relationship between time and frequency scaling we're now

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
scaling in time by stretching out we would expect the frequencies to be

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
lowered

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
by a factor of two we should now expect the

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
taped no to be an octave lower

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
matching the slower a so let's just play that okay let me stop it

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and again will rewind the tape

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
go back to

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the beginning and now will play this at

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
twice the speed so I change from three and three-quarters

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to 15 inches per second and now and I play it we would expect that

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to match the upper no and let's just do that Ste

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
us

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
us okay well

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
although thats a result that intuitively probably

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
makes considerable sense in fact what that is

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
is an illustration love the inverse relationship between

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
time scaling frequency scaling and also by the way it was finally my opportunity

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to play the glockenspiel on television okayed now

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in in addition their is another

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
very important relationship between the time and frequency domains

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
namely what is referred to as a

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
duality relationship and

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the duality relationship between time and frequency

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
falls out more less directly from

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the equations the analysis and synthesis equations in particular if we look at

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
synthesis equation which I repeat here

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and the analysis equation which I repeat below it

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
what we observe is dead in fact

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
these equations are basically identical

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
except for the fact that in the top

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
integral we have things as a function of Omega in the bottom integral as a

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
function of T

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and there's a factor of 10 ver tu Pai and by the way a minus sign

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
well you can look at the algebra

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
more carefully at your leisure but especially with this says

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is that if excessive Omega is

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the Fourier transform over type function exit see

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
then in fact except Amy

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is very much like the Fourier transform affective Omega

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
in fact it's the Fourier transform attacks have minus Omega

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to account for this minus sign and by the way there's just an additional

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
factor

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
one over 25 so the duality relationship which

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
follows from these two equations in fact

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
says that if x50

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
an ex vivo maker are a4e a transformed pair

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
if little accent capital XR Fourier transform pair

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
then capital lacks in fact has a $4 EA transform

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
which is proportional a little lax turned around well

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
this to outdo ality in the continuous time Fourier transform

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is very important it's very useful it by the way is not

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
duality that surface in a forty a series because as you recall the 48 series

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
begins with a continuous-time function

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and in the frequency domain generates a sequence

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
which with just naturally have the proper have

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
problems associated with it if we attempted to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
interpreted to ality and we'll see also:

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that in a discrete-time case one of the important differences between

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is the fact that in continuous-time we have to our the

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in discrete-time for then the discrete-time Fourier transform we don't

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
well

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
let's indicate illustrate this with an example

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in here are in fact two examples

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
a Fourier transform pairs taken from examples in the text

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to the top one being example

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
four-point 11 from the tax and it's a time for action

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
which is a sin 0 X over X type a function

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and its Fourier transform

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
corresponds to a

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
rectangular shape in the frequency domain there's also

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
another example in the text the example the preseason this one

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
which is example four-point 10 and an example four point 10

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
we begin with a rectangle

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and its Fourier transform is love the form

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
all a sin x over X function

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
so in fact if we look at these to

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
examples together what we see is

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the duality very evident in other words

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
if we take this time function and

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
instead think i've a frequency function that has the same form

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
then we simply interchange the rolls a time-frequency

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
in the other domains so the fact that these to correspond

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
means that these two cars find

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
course and in this particular example

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we because it the fact that we picked a symmetric function even function

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
in fact the additional twist love the time axis being reversed didn't show up

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in her in duality with this example

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
now one thing he says of course is that essentially

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
anytime you've calculated

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the 48 transform a one-time function

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
then you actually calculate the Fourier transform

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
to type functions another one being

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the dual example to the one that you just calculated

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
now also somewhat related to do our the

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
is what is referred to as parce balls

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
relation for the continuous-time Fourier transform

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and essentially what parts are false relationship says

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is that as kind of a a summary other

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
it says dead the energy

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
in a time function and the energy

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in its Fourier transform are proportional the proportionality factor

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
being a factor of two pi

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
it well that summarized here what's meant by the energy

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
is course the ago the magnitude squared effect City

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and the statement apart the balls relation and is dead

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that in a brawl the energy and accept T

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
is proportional to this integral which is the energy

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
indexable Megan now

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
although we've incorporated the 4e a series

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
within a framework for the Fourier transform parcels relation

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
needs to be modified slightly for

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
for a series because the fact that periodic signal

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
has an infinite amount of energy and its and essentially

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that former parcels relationship for the periodic case would say

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
infinity equals infinity which isn't too useful

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
however can be modified so that part's a false relationship for the periodic case

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
says essentially that the energy E

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
in one period other periodic time function

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in is proportional with this is the proportionality factor

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
proportional to the sum %uh the magnitude squared

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
up the coefficients in other words the energy in one period

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
is proportional to the energy in the sequence

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that represents the four EA series coefficients

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
now okay there are lots of other properties

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and there developed in the text in the study guide

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
a number a properties that we want to make particular you so

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
during this lecture and in later lectures

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
are ones that I summarize here and

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I won't demonstrate the proves but

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
a principally focus on some with the interpretation is the lecture goes on

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
well in the first property that I have listed here's what's referred to as the

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
time shifting property

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and the time shifting property says if I have a time function

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
with a Fourier transform mexico maker

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
if I shift that time function in time

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
dan that corresponds to multiplying

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the 48 transformed by this factor

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
now as you examine this factor what you can see is that

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this factor has magnitude unity

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and it has a phase which is linear with frequency

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and is slow %uh minus 20

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
so a statement to remember that will come up

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
many times throughout the cores

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
is that a timeshare after a displacement in time

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
corresponds to linear phase

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
or change in linear phase earlier change in phase and frequency

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
another property in and in fact a pair of properties

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that will make reference to as we turn our attention toward the end of this

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
lecture to

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
solving differential equations using the Fourier transform

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is hit was referred to as the differentiation property

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and its companion which is the integration property

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the differentiation property says again if we have

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
a time function whose with Fourier transform mexico maker

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the Fourier transform up the time derivative that

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is in corresponds to multiplying the Fourier transform

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
by a linear function of frequency so

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
here it's a linear able to change dead

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that corresponds to differentiation

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
now at first glance what you might think is that

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the integration property is just the reverse if that if

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
for the differentiation property you multiply by J Omega then

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
for integration you must abide by jail maker and thats almost correct

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
except not quite and the reason for the not quite

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is that recall that if you differentiate

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
what happens of course is that you lose a constant

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and if we have a time function thats some fun and energy signal plus a

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
constant

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
differentiating will destroy the constant

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and integration the immigration property in essence tries to bring that back

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so the integration property which is the inverse

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of the differentiation property says that we divide

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the transformed by J Omega and then

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
if in fact their was a constant added to accept T

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we have to account for that by inserting an impulse

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
into the Fourier transform and

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the file property that I want to draw your attention to

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
on this you graph is the linearity property

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
which is very straight forward to demonstrate from

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the analysis and synthesis equations which simply said is

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
if X 100 maker is the Fourier transform X 1ft

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and x2 Omega is the Fourier transform X 2ft

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
then the Fourier transform a linear combination is

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
a linear combination love the Fourier transforms

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
now let me emphasize also that these properties for the most part

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
apply both 240 a series and Fourier transforms

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because in fact and what we've done is to incorporate

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the forty a series within the

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
framework of the Fourier transform

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
okay now will be using a number of these properties shortly when we turn our

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
attention to

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
near-constant coefficient differential equations however before we do that I'd

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like to

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
focus on two additional

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
major properties and

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
these are what are referred to as the convolution property and the modulation

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
property

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and in fact the convolution property as I'm about

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
to introduces forms the

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
mathematical and conceptual basis for

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the whole notion of filtering which in fact will be

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
a topic by itself in a set of lectures and

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and in fact is a chapter by itself in the textbook

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
similarly what i'll refer to as the modulation property

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
again well occupy its own set

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
have lectures as we go through this scores and in fact has its own

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
a chapter in the textbook

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
let me in just indicate what the convolution property is

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and and what the convolution property

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
tells us is that

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
the 48 transform of the convolution

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
a two-time functions is the product

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
all therefore yea transforms

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so it says for example dead

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
if I have a linear time-invariant system

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and in I have an input exits the an impulse response HFT

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and the output of course being the convolution

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
then in fact if I look at this in the frequency domain

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the Fourier transform up the output

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is the for EA transform the input

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
times the Fourier transform the impulse response

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
now you can demonstrate this property

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and applying to 48 transforming doing the appropriate

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
in a changing the order integration et cetera

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but who what I'd like to draw your attention to is a

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
somewhat more intuitive interpretation of the property

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and the intuitive interpretations stems from

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
the relationship between the Fourier transform at the impulse response

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and what we refer to as the frequency response

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
now recall dead wanna have

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the things that lettuce to use complex exponentials as building blocks

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
was the fact that there I can functions linear time-invariant systems in other

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
words

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
if we have linear time-invariant system

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and I have an input which is a complex exponential

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the output is a complex exponential the same frequency

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
multiplied by what we call the frequency response

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and in fact the expression for the frequency response

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is identical to the expression for the four EA transform the impulse response

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in other words the frequency response is

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the Fourier transform of the impulse response

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
now in that context how can we

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
interpret the convolution property well

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
remember what I said at the beginning the lecture 1 I've pointed

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to the synthesis equation and I said in

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
in essence the synthesis equation tells us

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
how to decompose x50 as a linear combination a complex exponentials

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
what are the complex amplitudes are those complex exponentials

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
well interns love our notation year

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the complex amplitude of those complex exponentials

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
is Xserve Omega or proportional taxable make in particular taxable make a deal

00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,000
maker

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and then a factor two-part well

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
as this signal goes through this linear time-invariant system

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
what happens to each of those exponentials is

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it each one gets multiplied by the frequency response

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
at The Associated frequency

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
what comes out is the amplitude

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
all the complex exponentials that are used

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to bill the output

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
so in fact the convolution property

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
simply is telling us

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that interns have a decomposition the signal

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
enters a complex exponentials as we push that signal through linear

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
time-invariant system

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
were separately modifying with the frequency response were multiplying

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
by the frequency response the amplitudes

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
love the exponential comp phones used to build the input

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and that song intern is

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
the decomposition of the output in terms of complex exponentials

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
now and I I understand that kinda going through that involves

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
a little bit of sorting out and I strongly encourage you

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
to try to understand and interpret the convolution property

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
in knows conceptual terms rather than simply by

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
applying the mathematics to the convolution integral and seeing that

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
terms match up on both sides

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
now as i indicated the convolution property

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
forms the basis for what's referred to as filtering

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and this is a topic that will be treating a

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
considerable amount of detail and after

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
we've also gone through a discussion love the discrete-time Fourier transform

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
in the next several lectures however what I'd like to do is just

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
just indicate now a little bit love

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the conceptual ideas involve

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
essentially conceptually what filtering as its

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
typically referred to corresponds to

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
is modifying separately

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the individual frequency components in a signal

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the convolution property told us that if we

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
look at the individual frequency comp points they get multiplied by the

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
frequency response and so what that says is that we can amplify or it anyway

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
any of those comp own it separately using a linear time-invariant system

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
for example what I've illustrated here is

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the frequency response what is commonly referred to

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
as and ideal Lopez filter what an ideal 0 pass filter does

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
is to pass exactly

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
frequencies in one frequency range

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and eliminate totally frequencies outside that range

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
another filter which is not so ideal might for example

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
attenuate sit com phone it's in this band but not

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I rather attenuate conference in this band but not totally eliminate them

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
now interns a filtering we can think back

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to the differentiation property and in fact interpreter

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
differentiation or differentiator as a filter

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
recall that the differentiation property said

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
that the Fourier transform all the differentiated signal

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
is the for a transformer the original signal multiplied by J Omega

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
so what that says then

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
is dead if we have a differentiator opened the frequency response to that

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
is J Omega in other words the Fourier transform of the output is Jay Omega

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
times the Fourier transform the input

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and so the frequency response a differentiator

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
looks like this and turns its magnitude and what it does

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
of course is it amplifies high frequencies

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and attenuates low frequencies

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
well let me just to kinda cement summer these ideas

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
illustrate them in a context 0

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
one kind of signal namely signal which in fact

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
is the spatial signal rather than a time signal

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and this also gives me an opportunity to introduce you

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to our colleague JBJ for EA's

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
so if we could look at our colleague mister four EA

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
who by the way is on

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
not only person who had tremendously brilliant insights

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and his insights in fact have led to

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the developments really for the foundation the developments that

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
is the basis for this course he was also a very interesting fascinating person

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and there's a certain amount of historical discussion

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
about for EA and his background which you might enjoy reading in the text

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
in any case what you're looking at a course is a signal

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and the signal is a spatial signal and

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
it has high frequencies and low frequencies high frequencies

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
corresponding to things that are varying rapidly

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
spatially and low frequencies barings

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
very slowly spatially it so

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
for example we could low-pass filter

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
this picture simply by asking

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the video crew if they could slightly defocus

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and what you see as the picture is the focus if you can hold it there

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
is dead we've lost edges which

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
is the rapid variation and what we've retained is the broader

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
slow variation and now let's take out

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the d focusing low-pass filter and go back

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
to a focused image

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
okay now what

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and we can also consider is what would happen if we look

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
at the differentiated image and their are several ways that we can think about

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
one is that a differentiator of course the output of a differentiator

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
is larger where the discontinuity

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
or where the variation is faster

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and so we would expect the edges

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
to be enhanced if in fact we differentiated the image

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
or if we interpret differentiation in the context

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
love our filter then what we're saying

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
if hey what we're saying is that in effect

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
what's happening is that the differentiator is

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
accentuating the high frequencies

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because if the frequency shape the differentiator now recall that this all

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
kinda fits together is a nice package

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
be expected to actively the differentiation will enhance ages

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
when we talked about square waves and we so I have a for a series built up a

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
square wave

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
we saw that it was the high frequencies

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
that were required in order to build up the sharp

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
edges and so either viewed as a filter or viewed intuitively

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
we would expect that the differentiated image would in fact

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
get would in fact it anyway the slowly varying background and amplify

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the rapidly varying ages so let's look again at

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
our original image just to remind you love the fact that there are edges of

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
course and their

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
is more slowly varying backgrounds

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and now let's look at the

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
result love passing that through

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
a differentiator and as i think is

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
very evident in that in the resulting image

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
clearly is the edges that a retained and

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the slow back to slower background variations

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
are destroyed which is consistent with everything we've said

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
okay now i've emphasized the her will be returning

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to a much broader discussion a filtering at

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
a later point in the cores right now like to comment on another

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
property which here is also as i indicated a topic I've

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in its own right and which really is the dual

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
property to the convolution property and in fact could be argued directly from

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
duality

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and that is what's referred to as the modulation property

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
now the convolution property told us that

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
if we convolved in the time domain we multiply in the frequency domain

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and we know the time and frequency domains are interchangeable because it

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
to our the

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
so what that would suggest is dead

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
if we multiply in the time domain

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that would correspond to convolution in the frequency domain

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and in fact head that is exactly what the modulation property is

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I have a summarized here that if we multiply

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
a time function by another time function then

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
in the frequency domain week involved

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
whereas the convolution property is just the duel at that

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
namely convolved being in the time domain corresponds to

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
multiplication in the frequency domain

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the convolution property is the basis as i indicated for filtering

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the modulation property as I've summarized it here

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
in fact is the entire basis

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
for amplitude modulation systems issues

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
almost universally in communications and wait

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the modulation property is we'll see when we explored in more detail

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and we multiply by a sinusoidal

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
signal whose for EA transformers said impulses

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
then in a frequency-domain week involved and that corresponds

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
to taking the original spectrum and translating it

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
shifting it in frequency up to

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the frequency love the carrier namely

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the sinusoidal signal and as I said will

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
come to that in much more detail in a number of lectures

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
okay now we've seen a number of properties

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and I indicated sometime earlier when we talked about

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and differential equations that in fact it's the properties are the 48 transform

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that providers with a very useful

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
an important mechanism for solving linear constant coefficient differential

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
equations

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and but I'd like to do now

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
is illustrate the procedure the basis for that

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and I think what we'll do is illustrated simply in the context of several

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
examples

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
okay well in what i've indicated is

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
a system

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
with her a an impulse response HFT

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or frequency response teachable nigga and of course we know that in the time

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
domain it's just right to convolution

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
in the frequency domain its described through multiplication

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and I in essence

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
am assuming that we're talking about a linear time-invariant system

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and we're also going to assume that it's characterized by a win here comes the

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
coefficient differential equation

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
where we're going to oppose the condition

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that its causal linear and time-invariant

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
or equivalent Lee that the initial condition conditions

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
are consistent with initial rest

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and it's because it the fact that we're assuming

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
that is a linear time-invariant system that

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
we can describe it in the frequency domain through the convolution property

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and we can use the properties love the forty a transfer

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
so let's take as our example a first-order differential equation

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
as I indicate here so the derivative the output plus eight times the output is

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
equal to the input

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and now we can use the differentiation property

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
if we for EA transform mystic entire expression

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the differentiation property tells us that

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the forty a transformer the derivative of the output

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
is the for a transformer the output multiplied by J Omega

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and Lenny arity well let us

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
right the Fourier transform love this as eight times while Omega

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and since these are added together and since we have the linear

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
linearity property these are added together

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and XOM Omega is and the Fourier transform affect safety

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
so what we've used is the differentiation property

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and reviews the when the arity property

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
right now weekend solve this equation

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
for y Omega the forty a transformer the output

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
in terms of Xserve Omega the Fourier transform

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the input and a simple algebraic step

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
gets s to this expression so the for a chance for the output is one over

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Jamaica plus a

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
ties the forty a transformer the input and I just simply repeated

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that equation appear

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
now so far this is algebra

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and and question is now how do we interpret this

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
well we know that the for a transformer the output

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
is the forty a transformer the input times the Fourier transform

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
are the impulse response to the system namely the frequency response

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so in fact if we think love

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
a chip tanh Omega as a Fourier transform pair

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
then is the convolution property that lets us

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
quaid this term with

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
H Omega so here

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
were using the convolution property

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and so we know what the 48 transform

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
or the impulse responses they only one over

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
J Omega plus a now

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
in we may have for example what is in our problem

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
instead of getting the frequency response to get the impulse response

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and there are a variety of ways that we can't do this we can attempt to go

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
through the inverse Fourier transform expression

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
but in fact one of the most useful ways is their formally called

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
the inspection method informally

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
its called if you work that out going one way

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
then you ought to remember the answer so that you know how to get back

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
method so what that says is

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
remember dead we worked an example and in fact I showed you the example

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
earlier in the lecture that

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the Fourier transform a view to the minus eighty times a step

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
is one over J Omega plus a

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
so what is the inverse Fourier transform a 1-over J Omega plus a

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
well ants need to the minus eighty

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
times unit step

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and that's just simply remembering in essence this particular transformed pier

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
well I've drawn graphically

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
the magnitude of the Fourier transform here

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and below it we have the impulse response

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the apostle spines is as I just indicated either -80

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
times you see now let's go back up and look at

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the magnitude over the frequency response

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and given just a little bit of discussion that we had

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
previously about filtering you should be able to

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
in for something about the filtering characteristics

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
love this simple first-order differential equation

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
in particular if you look at that frequency response

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
the frequency response falls off with frequency and so it tends to do

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
is attenuate high frequencies and

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
retain low frequencies so in fact

00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
you could think of the defocus saying that we did on

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
the imager for EA you could think if that approximately as

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
similar to the kind of filtering action that you would get

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
by passing a signal through a first-order differential equation

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
okay now just illustrate in one

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
additional step in both evaluating inverse transforms and using Fourier

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
transform properties

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
to solve a near constant coefficient differential equations

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
let's take this same example and rather

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
then finding the impulse response let's find the response

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
to another exponential input

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
now we could of course do that using the convolution integral we just got the

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
impulse response so we can put that

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
through the convolution integral to get the response to this input

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but let's do it instead by going back to the differential equation

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and so here i'm taking a differential equation

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
all choose just to have some numbers to work with

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
a equal to 2 and now

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll choose an exponential on the right hand side either minus tee times you

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
have t

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and again we for EA transform the equation

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and we can remember

00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
this particular Fourier transform pair it's just the one who worked out

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
previously now with a equal to 1 clearly we're getting a lot of mileage out of

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
that example

00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and now if we wanted determine what the output why if he is

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
we can't do that by solving for Y Omega

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and then generating the inverse Fourier transform

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
well what's all this algebraically for y Omega

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and and that gets us to this expression

00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and this is not a Fourier transform that we've worked out before

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and this is have the second part to the

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
inspection procedure what we have is a forty a transform which is a product

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
of two turns each of which we can recognize

00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and what we can consider doing is expanding that out

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
in a partial fraction expansion namely as a summer turns

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
because the lady arity property associated with the 48 transform

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the inverse transform is then the song the inverse transform movie to those

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
terms

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
okay so if we expand this out in a partial fraction expansion

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and you can just verify that

00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
if you add these two together you get back to where we started

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
we now have the sum of two terms

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and if we now recognized by inspection

00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the inverse Fourier transform love this we see that it simply

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
minus either -2 TV times the unit step

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
this one is plus either the minus the times a unit step

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and so in fact it's the summer these two terms

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
which are the inverse transforms up the

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
individual turns in a partial fraction expansion

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
that then give us the for EA transform

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
all y ft

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
her I'm sorry for her rather the output

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
so this is a gypsy that this is why if the

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
which is the summer these two exponentials and this

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
is the inverse Fourier transform

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,000
love y Omega as we calculated it previously

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
okay well hopefully you're beginning to get some sense now

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
love how powerful and also beautiful

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
the 48 transform is we've seen already that

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
a glimpse or how it plays a role in

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
filtering modulation how its properties helpless with linear constant

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
coefficient differential equations et cetera

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
what we will do

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
beginning with the next lecture is develop

00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a similar set of tools for the discrete-time case and there are

00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
some very strong similarities to what we've done a continuous-time also some

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
very important differences

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and then after we have the continuous-time and discrete-time

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Fourier transforms

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
will then see how the concepts

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
involved in the properties involved leads to

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
very important powerful notions love filtering

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
modulation sampling and other

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
signal processing ideas thank you
