00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
these are all added together and it that linear combination
这些都加在一起，它的线性组合

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that forms the final output
形成最终的输出

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so that's really kind of the way we're thinking about it we have a general
所以这是样的，我们正在考虑这个问题，我们有一个大致的方式真的

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
sequence
序列

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we're thinking love each individual sample
我们正在考虑的爱每一个样本

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
individually each one of those pops the system
个别那些中的每一个弹出系统

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and because the linearity the response is the sum
并且，因为线性的响应的总和

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
for those individual responses
对于那些个别的反应

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
well thats what happens in discrete-time and
以及多数民众赞成在离散时间发生的事情，并

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
pretty much the same strategy works in continuous-time
几乎同样的战略工作在连续时间

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a particular
一个特定的

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we can begin in continuous-time
我们可以在连续时间开始

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
with the notion 0 decomposing
与概念0分解

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a continuous-time signal into
连续时间信号转换成

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
succession love are bitterly narrow rectangles
继承的爱情是苦涩窄矩形

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and as these rectangles is the with the rectangles goes
和这些矩形是用那张矩形

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
0 the approximation gets better and
0近似变得更好，

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
essentially what's going to happen is that you to those individual rectangles
本质上发生了什么事情要发生的是，你的那些个人矩形

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
as they get narrower and narrower correspond more and more
因为他们得到窄对应越来越多

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to an impulse well let me show you what I mean
一个很好的冲动让我告诉你我是什么意思

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
here we have a continue with time signal
在这里，我们有一个继续进行的时间信号

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and I've approximated it
我已经接近了

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
by staircase
由楼梯

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
so in Athens I can't think of this
所以在雅典，我不能想到这
