00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in the last lecture we discussed sinusoidal

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and real in complex exponential signals both

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for continuous-time and discrete-time no signals will form very

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
important building blocks when we

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
return to the discussion love Fourier analysis and later lectured

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in today's lecture I'd like to introduce

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
some additional basic signals specifically

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the unit step and unit impulse signal let's begin

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
with discrete-time and the discrete-time units that

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
in unit in polls the discrete-time unit step

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
is a sequence is a indicated here specifically

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a sequence which is zero for

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
negative values if its argument and equal to 1

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
for positive values up its argument and

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so mathematically

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the unit step sequence is one

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
for in greater than or equal to 0 and 0

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
for and less than zero the unit impulse sequence

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
likewise is defined in a straightforward way

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the union Paul sequence is a sequence which

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is 0 for all values if its argument

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
except for an equal 0 so

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the unit step in unit impulse sequence are defined in a straightforward way

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
mathematically and in fact in they are also related

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to each other in a straightforward way mathematically

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
specifically the unit in paul's

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
can be related to the unit step

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
through the relationship that i've indicated here

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Beltre van the unit impulse

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
equal to units that minus the unit stepped away

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
so mathematically the relationship

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
is what is referred to as a first

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
difference

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and to see the validity love this expression

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we can simply looking at the unit step

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and it's the late version so

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
here we show the unit step you then

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
here we show the unit step delayed

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
by one so it 0 for and less than or equal to 0

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and clearly if we subtract that the late step

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
from the original unit step everything subtract out except at

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
an equal 0 which at which point the difference is equal to 1

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and so the difference between you have an

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and you then -1 is simply the unit

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
impulse sometimes incidently also referred to as the unit sample

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
now

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in a similar way we can

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
express the unit step in terms of the unit impulse and there are several ways

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of doing this

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
one-way is through a relationship referred to as a running start

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
what I mean by that is

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the following expression: if we

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
think love morning

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
some from minus infinity

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
up to some bad UN

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
all a unit in paul's

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
our unit sample then this running some

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
in fact is equal to the unit step

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and we can see that in a

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
fairly straightforward way by simply observing

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
dead in this expression when and is less than 0

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
is nothing accumulated in the some

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and we can see that graphically as they've shown here

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
so for and less than zero we accumulate no turns into some

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
whereas for an greater than

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
0 we cumulate one non-zero value in the some

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
namely the value of the unit sample at an equal 0

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so we have then

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
one expression for the relationship between the unit step in the unit sample

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
we can also develop another relationship

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
by observing

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in essence there if we look at the unit step sequence

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
as I've returned to hear weekend

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
in effect think the unit step sequence

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
as a six-session love unit

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
impulses one following another so

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
if we consider

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
forming Assam

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
all the lady impulses as i indicate mathematically here

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and as i indicate graphically down below

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we have an impulse here at an equal 0

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and an impulse here and any calls one

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and impose here at any cost to et cetera

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and when we continue to add these up

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
then what they add up to is the

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
unit step sequence and so mathematically then

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that would correspond to and im polls that an equal 0

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
plus an impulse to 10 equals 1 was an impulse

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
at any calls to et cetera now in this

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
in continuous-time we have a very

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
more or less similar situation we

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
will find it equally useful to talk about a

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
unit step continuous-time signal and

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the unit impulse continues time signal let's begin

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
with the continuous-time unit step be

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
continuous-time unit step function is graphically

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
indicated as I've shown here it's a time function

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
which is 0 party less than zero

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and it's one for T greater than 0

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and so mathematically what it corresponds to

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is you if he defined as

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
a time function which is zero for T less than zero

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
one pretty greater than 0

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
now an obvious question is what happens

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
at Evil zero and the difficulty here which is not a difficulty that arises in

00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the discrete-time

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
case is that act equal 0

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
the unit step function is in fact discontinuous

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which generates a variety mathematical problems

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and one can define the units that

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
at equal zero in a variety ways

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but the essential point is that the unit step function

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is discontinuous so in effect

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what we need to do is think if the unit step function

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
as the limit all a continuous function

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and so we can define a function which I specify here

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
as use a delta see

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and used to build the T is a time function

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which is 0:40 less than zero

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
linearly increases to time Delta

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
which would correspond to this breakpoint and then

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
one following that and so

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we can think then love the discontinuous units step

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
as the limiting form use a delta at:

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
as Delta goes to zero

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
now we also wanted to find a

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
unit impulse function and it had a fairly straightforward definition

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in discrete-time in continuous time things get

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
slightly more difficult and to motivate the definition

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
let me return to the discrete-time definition

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
all or the rather the discrete-time relationship between

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the unit step and the unit impulse function

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
in discrete-time we saw

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
dead the unit impulse function

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
is the first difference all

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the unit step function

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
well similarly in continuous-time

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
we can talk about and impulse function

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
which is the first derivative love

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
a unit step function

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
so the unit impulse as we wanted to find it

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
is the derivative of the units that

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
course we just finished discussing the fact that

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
the unit step function is in fact discontinuous it equals 0

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but we can't think love its derivative as related

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to this approximation to the units there

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and specifically we will think love

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the continuous-time in polls as

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the derivative %uh use a belt 50

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
as Delta goes to zero so

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to define the unit in polls we think I've the derivative

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
love this approximation to the unit step

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and then observe what happens as Delta goes to zero

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
we have then the definition love

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the unit impulse function

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
more or less formally to find as

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the first derivative of the units step

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
or thought I love as the limiting form

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
love the derivative love

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the approximation to the unit step

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in the limit as Delta the

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the duration love the discontinuity goes to zero

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
well let's look at that if we

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
think about the derivative love

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
used to build the T the derivative of course is 0 for T less than zero

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
its equal to a constant during this linear slow

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and then it 0 pretty greater than Delta so

00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the derivative abusive Delta 50 will then

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
be as i've indicated here and

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is simply a rectangle with a height

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
which is one over Delta and with which is equal to Delta and observed that no

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
matter what the value of Delta is

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the area is always equal to 1

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
now as we let Delta go to zero

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
what happens is that the width of the rectangle get smaller

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the height of the rectangle gets bigger the area still remains one

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
as Delta goes to zero of course the with goes to zero

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and the height goes to infinity

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and graphically we choose to depict that

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
as an arrow where

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the arrow indicates the fact dead we have

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and im polls occurring at equal 0 and

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and the height of the in polls is used to represent

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
what the area above the impulses and in this case

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
since we took the derivative of the units that the

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
quite is people to want

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
so the impulse has 0 with

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
infinite hi area one its

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
mathematically not terribly comfortable because

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
what we've done is taking the derivative of the unit step which has a

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
discontinuity at the origin

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and there's a mathematical difficulties with doing that

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
well in fact return to another interpretation

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
%uh the in polls later up

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
can't emphasize sum up the sir discomfort with the impulse

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I remember something that Sam Mason

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
used to say that a student said about the unit impulse which was

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
his definition was unit impulse is something that's so small everyplace I

00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
can't see it

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
except that one point where it's so big I can see it in other words I can see it

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,000
at all

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
well except some informality

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
with the unit impulse function in the continuous-time

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
K's and generally we'll see

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that we won't get into particular difficulty okay now

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the impose is the derivative the step we saw

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
in the discrete-time case that step

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
could be recovered from the in polls through a running some

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
in continuous time with the impulse is the derivative overstep we would

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
moralist reasonably expect that this step

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
would be like an integral the in polls and indeed that's true

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in fact mathematically the relationship is

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
that the unit step

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
function in continuous-time

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is the running integral although

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the unit impulse function and

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
so is the integral from minus infinity up to time TV

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
weighty is the argument at which

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
were examining you ft and so

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
just as with the discrete-time case if

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
we are looking at T less than zero

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
is no area accumulated in the integral

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
if we're looking at T greater than 0 then we accumulate the area

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
under the impulse

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
okay now will shortly

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
be returning to a

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
further discussion in use love

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
impulses and step functions

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and in particular what we'll see is that

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
they provide a very convenient and powerful mechanism

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
for describing a particular class two systems referred to

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
as linear time-invariant systems to lead up to that discussion which will

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
be the principal focus of the next lecture

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
let's for the remainder this lecture talk about systems in general

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and then some properties have systems and

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
as the lecture proceeds the

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
specific properties that I want to get to our properties

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
when the arity and time very so let's first talk about

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
systems in general and a system

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
in general in its most general definition

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
it simply a transformation

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
from an input signal to an output say so in a continuous-time case

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we would have a continuous-time system

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the input exit the

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and the output why if the and the box

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in essence is used to denote a transformation from

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
except the to white T and sometimes will also use a shorthand notation

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
along the lines of indicating that the input except the

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is transformed to the output y'at

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
now we have exactly the same

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
kinda definition in the discrete-time case in the discrete-time case

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
of course the inputs are sequences

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and the outputs are sequences and our shorthand notation

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
is simple often we talk about systems

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
will want to talk about interconnections systems

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and will see you again in later lectures that interconnections become very

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
important and powerful

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and in in the way of introducing

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
terminology let me introduce the terminology for a few basic important

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
interconnections systems the first

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is what's referred to as a cascade

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
systems or sometimes as the series

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
interconnection systems and

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
putting two systems in cascade as i've indicated here

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
means taking the output have one system

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
let's say system one and using Matt as the input

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
to the second system which are denoted as system to

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
so in this cascade with

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
system one first and system to second

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
we have the output system one going into the input

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
system to now

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
we could've course take those two systems

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and cascade them in the reverse order

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
namely take the output system to and put it into

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the input of system one and

00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
i've indicated that here and we have system to first in the Cascade

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
followed by system one it's important to keep in mind

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
dead in general for general systems

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in the order in which you can SCADA systems is very important

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and in fact the

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
overall system transformation will be different depending on which system came

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
first and which system came second for example

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
its system one was let's say in a system for which the output doubles the input

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
is double the input and system to

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the output is the square root of the input clearly

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
doubling first and then taking the square root is different

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
then taking the square root first and then double

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
now kinda amazingly

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
what we'll see again when we get

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to this issue linearity and time-invariant switcher class of systems

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that will focus in on

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
somewhat amazingly it turns out that for that

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
specific classes systems the SIS

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
overall system transformation is independent of the order in which

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the system's are cascade and we'll see that of course in more detail later on

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
alright well that's a cascade or series interconnection

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
let's look at another interconnection which is a parallel

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
interconnection systems and

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
here what's meant by the interconnection

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is that the input

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
is fitted simultaneously into system one

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and into system to

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and then the outputs these two systems

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
are added to give the overall system output

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
now in this particular case

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
in contrast to a cascade no matter

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what the systems are it turns out

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that a parallel combination the order in which

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
their put in parallel

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is the out the overall transformation is independent up the order

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and of course that follows from the fact that we simply adding up outputs

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and the outputs can be added in any order because the fact that addition

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
doesn't care

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
in which order you're heading things up

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
okay so that's the parallel interconnection and let's look at

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
one more interconnection which is what's referred to

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
as a feedback interconnection and

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
this again is a interconnection that will

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
become a very important topic much later in the course

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but let me just indicate at this point what I mean by it

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but a feedback interconnection means is that

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
we have one system

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
system one

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
with an input in an output

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the output a system one is the output of the overall system

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and that output is fayed

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
into system to

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
the output of system to is then handed

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to the input to the overall system

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so in essence what happens in a feedback interconnection

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
we have one system the output in that system

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
is fed back through system to

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
added to the overall input and then that some

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
is what forms the input the system one and will see that there are

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
lots of uses for feedback and of course also lots of ways the feedback getting

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the gets in the way

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
in fact probably some love you are already familiar with all the issues &

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
feedback

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
for example in audio systems or whatever but this will be

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
a topic that will devote considerable amount of time to

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
later in the course and then

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
of course there are lots of other interconnections

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
love systems and as the course progresses we'll see

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
lots of ways in which systems get interconnected both in series and

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
parallel and feedback interconnections et cetera

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to achieve a wide variety of things

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
now what I said so far relates to

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
systems in general and you can't say much

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
about systems when you try to treat them in the most general form

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
so it's useful and important to focus in

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
on properties that system may or may not have

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
so what I'd like to do now is turn our attention

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to system properties and will define

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
a number of them some of them will want to impose on a system

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
some love the movie we may not want to impose on a system

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
but as things progress will

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
tend to find it useful to an ass

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
weather is system does or doesn't have a certain property

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
well let's begin with the property which I A

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
refer to here and

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
is memoryless and what I mean by

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
system being memoryless is dead

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the output at any

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
given time t0 depends

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
only on the input at the same time and so

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
know what I'm suggesting is that a memoryless system

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is one for which the output at a specific time

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
depends only on the input at that time

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and that statement is true or that definition

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
applies both for continuous-time

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
as i've indicated it here and also

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
for discrete-time as i've indicated here and so

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
we have similar definition in discrete-time

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that the system is memoryless

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
if the output at any given time

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
depends only on the input at that time well

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in I have a number of examples here let's look at

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the first example which in which the output is the square if the input

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and that is a possible system either in continuous-time

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
for discrete-time and that system as

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you would expect is commonly referred to as

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
square insists the square

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
up a signal and anytime depends only on

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the value the signal at that time clearly

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
square is a memoryless system so

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
in fact weekend indicate here and this system

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is members

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
another important system is

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
what is referred to as an integrator its

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the the output is equal to

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
the integral love the input

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
here as i've indicated it

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
its a not just integrating except TV but its integrating the square affect safety

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and whether we square

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
before we had a great or not the essential point

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is there since we're integrating the input

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the value of the output anytime

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
is an accumulation a past history the input well

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
accumulation a past history in essence implies memory

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to get the output at a given time

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
requires the input

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
over an interval specifically for longer than that time so

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
this system in fact is not memory loss

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and now I have a

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
third system the fine here the third system

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
is a system the discrete-time system

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
in which the output is equal to

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the input but not quite the output at some time let's say for example that an

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
equal 0

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
is equal to the input at one

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
time sample or instant or value with the index

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
before that and so this in fact

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
is a system for which the output is simply the input the lady or shifted

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
by one sample so this system is referred to as

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
unit delay

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and now the question

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
the question is is that system memoryless

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
well the output depends only on the input the output at any instant depends

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,000
only

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
on the input at one instant but

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
since it depends on an instant

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
prior to the time in which were looking we're different than the time at which

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
were looking

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
it violates the definition a memoryless

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
that we introduce and so in fact the unit the LEI

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
is a system that has memory and so

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
let's indicate that year so this is not a memoryless

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
system because of the fact that there is one unit at the lay

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and in essence the lady requires memory

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
okay so bats the issue memory and

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and a memoryless systems let's now turn to another

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
property which a system

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
may or may not have the property referred to as

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
invertia billet now

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
essentially would inverted bility means is dead

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
given the output above the system

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
you can figure out uniquely with the input was

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
thats one definition for infertility

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
said another way convertibility means that

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
given the output there's only one input that could have caused it

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that's another common so definition for portability

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
another way of looking at it is in fact

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
to look at it in the context love a cascade

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
love systems so

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
let's consider a system and here

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
is a system which are referred to as system a

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and this could be continuous-time and discrete-time

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
it has an input x1

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
TV or an depending on whether it's continuous-time and discrete-time that

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we're talking about

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and an associated output

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and here we had

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
go system be with

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
its associated input an output and

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
now let's put these two systems in cascade

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so will take the output system one and feed it

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
into the input love system

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to or system be so

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
the output system a goes into the input a system be

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and if system is invertible

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and system be is its in burgers

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
then the consequence

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
is that the output subsystem be

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
is equal to the input of system a

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
now I know there there a lotta

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
inputs and outputs and inverse is in the air

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
by essentially what we mean by what I just said

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
is that if we have system a

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and is invertible and if

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
we cascaded with its infers

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
system be then

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
the overall cascade these two systems

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
is simply what's referred to as

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the identity system

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and the identity system is simply a system

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
which if you put a signal into it you get the same signal

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
out a bit in other words the overall system is

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
no transformation at all clearly course

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
for a system to be able to be cascaded with another system

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
to generate the identity system requires

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that the first system system a be invertible

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
so let's a

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
look at some examples if we had

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
system a as i've indicated here

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
where now the output is

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
the running integral love

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the input and remember that we saw the running into role when we talked about

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
the relationship between

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
steps and impulses if this happened to be in in polls

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
then the output would be a step this system

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is referred to of course as an integrator

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
since the output is

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the running integral love the input

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and in the

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
integrator in fact is an invertible system

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and its infers

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
is system for which the output is the derivative

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
%um so the inverse

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
or system a if system a is an integrator

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is system for which the output

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
is equal to the derivative the input which not surprisingly

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is referred to and

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is a differentiator

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
so an integrator is invertible

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
its inverse is a differentiator which you might want to think about

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
is the question of whether a differentiator

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
is invertible now to answer that what you would ask yourself is

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
if you always knew with the derivative with the signal is would you necessarily

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
know with the signal was in other words if you have a differentiator

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
you have the output of the differentiator

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
could you always figure out with the input words if you could

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the system would be invertible if you couldn't the system would not be

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,000
invertible

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
so you might just want to think about that I guess

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I won't tell you right now but I'm sure that

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
dead you'll think about that more particularly with the

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
guidance that the video manual

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
okay well let's look at one

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
last system in i've indicated here

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
a system for which the output

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
is related to the input through this

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
heard and what I mean by this curve which

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
wasn't done a quite as well

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
as I might have is that

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
the output is equal to the square

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the input so this system

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
is our square as we talked about before

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
we saw previously

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
are discussed the fact previously bad

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the squarer is a memoryless

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
system

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and now the question is is the square

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
an invertible system well question then

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
is if you given the square the signal

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
can you figure out with the signal is and

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
as I'm sure you've already suspected the answer to that is no

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
because obviously if the signal was negative or positive you wouldn't be

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
able to figure that out

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and you square so in fact

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the square is not invertible part so

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
we've introduced several properties and by the way

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
as we've gone through it also in introduce some systems that will turn

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
out to be

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
useful important systems and

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
now it's continue with some other properties a property

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
dead will find useful to make reference

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
to from time to time and will in fact play fairly important role in a variety

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
of discussions

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
during the course is the property

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
which is referred to as causality now

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in essence what causality beans

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is the following the system is said to be causal

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
if as one way of saying it only responds

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
when you kick it is another way of saying it

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
its response that any time only depends on values at the input

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
prior to that time so

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
a causal system both continuous-time and discrete-time

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
is to find sometimes

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
as a system which has the property that

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the output and anytime depends only on

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the input prior or equal to that time

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
essentially what we're saying

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
is that the system can't anticipate

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
future imports and so that in fact

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
is another possible definition for causality

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
that the system is causal

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
if it can't anticipate future inputs finally at

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
not an alternative way of saying it mathematically

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
is as follows: if I have

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
to signals X 1ft

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
nx2 T with their associated outputs why 150 and white 2

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
T then a system

00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
is said to be causal if it only if it has the property

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
that if those two inputs are identical up until sometime

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
then the outputs are identical up until the same time

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
so if we have two signals that

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
are exactly the same up until sometime and perhaps do something different later

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
on

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
causality requires that

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the outputs not anticipate the fact that those inputs

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
are at some future time going to do something different

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and that in fact is the most useful mathematical

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
definition of causality and of course I've

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
written that here for continuous-time

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and a the

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
same definition of causality also

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
applies for discrete-time

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
okay well it's look at an example

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
let's take an example

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
which is a system which is

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the following discrete-time system the output at any given time

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
is some love

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
exit Van X event the way

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and active and anticipated and

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
this is in fact a system is very useful

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and referred to as moving average

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and so if we think 0 moving average

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
if we have here

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
a sequence X the van annex the van

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
with other values kinda going off

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
in both directions and any value

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
for any value n0 at which were computing the output

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and this is why I have in the output we take

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
X 70 X 70 -1

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and X 70 plus one and so

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to format moving average we would take

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
these three bad news and combine them together

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and a moment and dividing by 3 to get back

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
well is the system causal

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
one way to answer that is

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
to determine whether the output at any given time depends on future values if

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
the input

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and clearly if you look at this what you see is that the output at time n0

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
depends both on past values and on future bad

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
as opposed to another moving average

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
which i've indicated here where I'd simply shifted the values

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
that I combine together and in this case

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
because love the way in which I picked the values

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the output depends on

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
value in n0 value

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
at and 0 -1 and the bad you

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
at n0 -2 so why I've n0 would depend here

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
on X 70 X 70 -1

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and X 70 -2 and

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
so in this case the system

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
is not causal and

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in this case the system is cause

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
all right now let's turn to another system property the property

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
referred to as stability now there lotsa

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
definitions of stability a and

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
there some of them get very mathematical

00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and formal would we've chosen

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and what will use as our definition stability is what's called

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
bounded input founded output stability essentially the definition is

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that a system is stable

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
if in only a for every bounded input

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the output is found so the notion is

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
if you have a system any input never gets above

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
some finite value and stability requires

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that the output also stay within some bounded back

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and I'm sure the stability and instability your things that you're

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
kinda

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
arm informally familiar with let me

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
just kinda are emphasize the point with

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the something that I borrowed the

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
actually from my son

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
with some reluctance on his part a if we

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
for example take a system like this which is in essence a pendulum

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
this system is a holding it here is stable

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
because if I put in a bounded input which is the displacement

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
the output which is the movement of it

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
remains found now on the other hand

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
if I put the system like this which is

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
in fact what's referred to as an inverted pendulum although we could

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
conceivably get this to balance

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
just a slight displacement because the fact that the pendulum is inverted

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
a slight displacement and the output

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
becomes unbounded now

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
an interesting thing with the inverted pendulum by the way which

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sure all of you if you're anything like me

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
was intrigued with as a kid was the notion that you could take an inverted

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000
pendulum

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and in effect turn it back into a stable system

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
by using what I'm doing right now

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
which is feedback but I've done in that case

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
is I stabilize the system by

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
using feedback visual feedback from my eye

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
to my hand and in fact one of the very important things that we'll see about

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
feedback when we talk about feedback systems much later in the course

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is that one of their very important applications is

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
in stabilizing unstable systems by the way one of their problems

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is dead if not used correctly it can destabilize

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
stable system okay well let's

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
continue on with our a property of stability

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I have here again the example

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
of an integrator and as

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I indicate here if we have an integrator and we put a step

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
function into it or step signal into it

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the output is what's referred to as a ramp

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
signal it linearly increases now question is

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is a ramp on bounded the input is

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
is bounded step input is bounded the ramp is unbounded

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
because if you try to establish

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
any bound on it you can always go out far enough in time

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
so that the output will exceed that ban so

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
in fact the integrator is

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
not stable

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
okay now finally I'd like to turn

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
to two properties that will make considerable

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
you so there's the course goes on the properties

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
love time invariance and when the arid

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
time invariance

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
in essence says

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
bat the system doesn't really care

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
what you call the origin in other words

00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it says if you take the input and your shift in time

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
all that you've done is taken the output and shifted in time by the same amount

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
someone more formally as i've indicated here

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
if in continuous time we have an input X

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
which generates an output y'at then

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
time invariance requires that

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
if the input is shifted by any amount of time the output is shifted by the same

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
amount of time and exactly

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the same applies in discrete-time for example

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
if we have a system which is the system I've shown here

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
which by the way is the system that we talked about previously to go

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
from step sequence upstart from an imposed sequence to step sequence

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
we call that a running some and actually

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
white it's also often called is an accumulator

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
what it does is accumulate past values

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the input well is the

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
accumulator time-invariant the best way to establish that

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
is to work through the equations and verified that it either

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
does or doesn't satisfy the formal definition

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
time invariance informally if you think about it

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
it makes intuitive sense that the accumulator

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
is time-invariant because if you're accumulating values

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and a few the LEI the values that you're putting into the accumulator

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
then the associated values that come out will be delayed by the same amount

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the accumulated it doesn't care really where if you shift the input is just

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
simply shift the Associated output but

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
more generally with your trying to test time-invariant it's important to return

00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
to the definition

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and that's what you're required to do in the samples

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in the videomail okay well

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I indicate another example

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
we had the example become an accumulator here's another example which

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
in fact as we'll see later is

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
a system which is a modulator

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the output is the input modulated and

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
although you might think it first that this system

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is time-invariant in fact

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it is not because the input shifted

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
generates an output which is

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
the input shifted times

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
the same modulation function whereas

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
if we were to take the output above the system

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
we're X 50 is the input than

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
what that would correspond to

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
is sign T-minus t0

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
times X love t-minus 20

00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and since these two are not equal

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
this system is not time and very

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and this is an example that often

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
causes a slight amount of difficulty because

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
it seems like when you look at it it ought to be

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and so I strongly encourage you in the context that using

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
working problems in the manual

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that you think very carefully about this and on

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and at least believe that when I told you was the right answer

00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
okay now the final

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
property that I want introduced today is the property

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
love linearity and

00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
linearity is defined in manner

00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
similar for continuous-time in discrete-time

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and what it says is that

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
if we have some inputs with associated outputs

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
let's say X 150 X 2ft

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
then a system is linear

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
if it has the proper the that the output

00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to a linear combination of those inputs is the same

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
linear combination love The Associated outputs

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and so that's what I've indicated here dead

00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
if we now put into the system a linear combination of those inputs

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
then for linearity we require that the output

00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
is the same linear combination and exactly the same

00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
apply is in discrete-time

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and you can show from this definition dead if a system is linear

00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
with two inputs and its linear in terms of an arbitrary number

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
imports I have

00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
a number of examples and

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
these are examples there'd again I ask you

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
to think about as you look at the video manual

00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
just to suggest the answer as well at the suggest but to tell you the answer

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
the integrator as we have here is linear

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
this system in which the output is double the input plus a constant

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
you would kinda think is linear because it's a straight line

00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
but one has to be careful and in fact as it turns out

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
this is not linear are there is a qualifier attached to it

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
because it has a property referred to is incrementally linear

00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
which is discussed somewhat more in attacks

00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and finally we have a system which is the square

00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
that I've indicated again here

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and squaring is definitely not

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
a linear operation

00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
okay so what we've done then is to

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
introduce a number properties systems

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
a and we've also by the way is a stress previously

00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
as we've gone along introduced also a number of important and useful systems

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
like the accumulator the integrator the differentiator

00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
et cetera well we'll see

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
is that the properties of when you're ready in time invariance

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
in particular become central

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
important properties and in the next lecture

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
what will show is there with

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
systems that are linear and time-invariant

00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
the use love the impulse function

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
both in continuous-time and discrete-time provides an

00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
extraordinarily

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
important and useful mechanism

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
for characterizing systems thank you
