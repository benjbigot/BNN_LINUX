are

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,780 
for last time we

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,190 
introduce the notion that mapping
continuous-time filters to discrete-time

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,430 
filters and we developed in Polson
variance as

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,369 
one useful technique for carrying out
that type mapping

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,000 
but I'd like to do in this lecture

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,729 
is illustrate in Polson variants as a
design procedure

20
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,190 
in the context so one specific

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,390 
class all filters namely Butterworth
filters

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,970 
and in then following that will proceed
on to discuss

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,090 
another very important and useful
mapping or design procedure referred to

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,820 
as the by linear transformation

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,060 
so to begin let me

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,830 
just discuss briefly what the class a
Butterworth

27
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,380 
filters is and specifically

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,619 
the Butterworth filters are the fine

29
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:55,040 
through their frequency response a
transfer function and I'm

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,299 
using capital be to denote a Butterworth
filter

31
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,759 
and by definition the magnitude square
to the frequency responsible Butterworth

32
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,430 
filter

33
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,600 
is given by this expression and for
example

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,459 
if and more equal to 1 then this would
simply

35
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,730 
correspond to the magnitude squared love
the frequency response

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,150 
for a first order differential equation
now if you

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,790 
look at the frequency response be a
filmmaker

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,920 
for this class the filters

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440 
I've illustrated that below and

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,790 
what we see is that

41
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,040 
the frequency response starts at Unity

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,690 
because that's that's the way that its
normalized and it has

43
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,019 
a monatomic characteristic in the past
band and the stop and

44
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,859 
at a frequency equal to the pram inner
Omega subsea

45
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:52,160 
up here which is referred to as the
cutoff frequency

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,290 
the Butterworth filter frequency
response

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,090 
always goes through the same point
namely point 707

48
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,120 
and as the order the Butterworth filter
capital and

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,459 
increases the transition

50
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,060 
from the passband to the stop band

51
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,389 
becomes sharper and sharper so for
higher-order filters then

52
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,410 
the frequency response is flattering the
passband

53
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,169 
and drops of more quickly and attenuates
more

54
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,489 
in this topic now

55
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,760 
in designing Butterworth filters what we

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,840 
we want to look at is the location at
the polls

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,699 
all the system function and

58
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,989 
we can in for those from our definition

59
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,320 
I'll what the frequency response for the
Butterworth filter is

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,720 
in particular we have this expression

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,760 
for the magnitude squared the frequency
response

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,489 
and we recognize that of course as

63
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,799 
be love J Omega times be

64
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,250 
love minus J Omega that's what the
magnitude squared

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,160 
will be equal to and in order to convert
this

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,139 
to an expression describing the system
function or in terms that the

67
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,220 
more general applause transform variable
ass

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,900 
well we recognize is dead J Omega

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,259 
in the more general setting simply
corresponds to

70
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,600 
the applause transform variable s so

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,680 
this product in fact

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,820 
is the applause transform for st. go to
jail make a

73
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,500 
more generally then this is the result
of evaluating

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,449 
be a vast eyes be a minus S&S equals J
Omega

75
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,430 
consequently comparing this expression

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,870 
with this statement leads us to the
conclusion

77
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,110 
dead the transfer function be a badass

78
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,310 
the Butterworth filter times be off
minus s

79
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,660 
is given by the expression that I
indicate here

80
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,449 
simply replacing J Omega by S

81
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,300 
now what we want to look at are the
holes

82
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,509 
all be a vast that's what we'll want to
get as we

83
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,860 
design a Butterworth filter and

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,780 
we can recognize the polls love this
product

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,449 
simply by looking at the roots at the
denominator polynomial

86
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,210 
and those roots are just taking a
counter this factor 2n

87
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,680 
those routes are at J Omega subsea

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120 
times the 2n roots I'll

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,650 
-1 those roots in fact all I on a circle

90
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,659 
an the consequences that is that

91
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,129 
the holes all this expression

92
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,169 
are on a circle the circle

93
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,770 
is radius omega-6 see and the polls are
distributed

94
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,620 
around the circle so here I demonstrated

95
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,360 
the polls love be a vast size be at
minus s

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,860 
for the specific case for capital and is
equal to 3 so there are a total of six

97
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,969 
polls

98
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:17,150 
around the circle and

99
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,810 
then for this specific case the polls a
space by

100
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,030 
sixty degrees now we have PSA's be at
minus s

101
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,210 
to get the system function for the
Butterworth filter we'd like to get

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,099 
BFS and the question now is how do we
get that

103
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,889 
well the thing to recognize is dead
wherever

104
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,499 
this factor has a route

105
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,629 
this factor has to have a root at

106
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:51,599 
the negative location so in fact when we
look at these polls we compare them

107
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,960 
with this for example associated with be
a badass

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,219 
this associated with the at minus s and

109
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:03,020 
likewise we compare these two together
likewise we compare these two together

110
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,460 
and so we can extract the evas from this
product

111
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,340 
simply by taking one poll at a beach
those pairs

112
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,469 
now a question of course is I did each
pair which one do we associate with BFS

113
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,469 
wish to associate with the minus says

114
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,499 
and the answer drops out fairly simply

115
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,900 
if we recognize dead if

116
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,210 
we want to design filters that are
stable

117
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,289 
then be a vast the transfer function
that we're designing

118
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,439 
must have all its polls in the left
after the S play

119
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,860 
so in fact we would associate outta each
of these pairs

120
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,979 
we would associate the left airplane
poll with the evas

121
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,270 
and so the transfer function

122
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,469 
for the Butterworth filter for this
particular case where the parameter

123
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,710 
where this designates the parameter
Omega subsea

124
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,389 
capital and his three namely a third
order Butterworth filter

125
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,650 
is this center pole locations given
those

126
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,249 
of course we can figure out simply
throughout your break means

127
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,349 
what the transfer function be a veces

128
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,270 
alright so that's what in Butterworth
filters are in now

129
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,430 
what I'd like to do is talk about

130
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,300 
the design or additional Butterworth
filter

131
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,139 
using the design technique that we
introduced last time namely in polls and

132
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,689 
variance

133
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:35,200 
and the context in which I will

134
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,390 
phrase the design is the context

135
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,419 
love mapping a

136
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,830 
continuous-time signal to a
discrete-time signal

137
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,100 
carrying out filtering using the
discrete-time

138
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,830 
go to that we're designing and then
mapping back so

139
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,620 
we're talking about now a discrete-time
filter

140
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,350 
that we want to designed to impose
severe in variance from

141
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,810 
Butterworth filters from continues time
Butterworth filters

142
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,420 
and we're going to get our design
specifications

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,770 
in the context loved having

144
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,890 
considered discrete-time processing of
continuous-time signals

145
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,910 
where we will map from

146
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,630 
a continuous-time signal to a sequence

147
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,250 
carry out the filtering with the
discrete-time filter

148
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,280 
that we're going to design and then

149
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,200 
we will take the resulting filtered
output

150
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,930 
and map it back to the continuous-time
signals

151
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,510 
but this discrete-time filter is

152
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,980 
the one that we're talking about
designing and

153
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,680 
for choice a parameter there's a
sampling frequency of course involved in

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,910 
this process

155
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,460 
and the value that I'll pick for the
sampling frequency

156
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,820 
is 10 killers

157
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,030 
okay all fairly straightforward so far

158
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,470 
and so since we have a

159
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,150 
sampling rate of 10 killer hurts we

160
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,420 
want to first look at our specifications

161
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,940 
on the desired continuous type filter

162
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,410 
and then mapped those to appropriate

163
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,550 
specifications on the discrete I told

164
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,670 
and what I'll pick for the

165
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,100 
desired specifications on the
continuous-time filter

166
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,430 
is that at

167
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,470 
one kilohertz I will ask

168
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,260 
that the continuous-time frequency
response

169
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,190 
be down by no more then 1db

170
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,130 
in comparison with its value at Omega
equal 0

171
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,610 
so that in effect specifies the behavior
in the past band

172
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,280 
for the specifications on the passband
and

173
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,360 
for the stop band specify dead

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,790 
the filter is down by 15 DB

175
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,850 
by the time we've gotten to
one-and-a-half kilohertz

176
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,280 
so we have in essentially the beginning
of the transition band the end of the

177
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280 
past and it won't kill hurts

178
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,860 
and the beginning at the stop and at one
point five killer hurts

179
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,980 
and since we're talking about designing

180
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,100 
a Butterworth filter we know that the
Butterworth filter is

181
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,760 
monatomic in the past and stop and and
so

182
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,510 
will have a filter specification

183
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,690 
something is a show here this represents

184
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,920 
the allowable passband tolerance

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,180 
this is the allowable stop and tolerance

186
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,270 
and if I can draw this without

187
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,170 
getting myself into trouble a sexually
were looking for a filter then

188
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,990 
then always stays between

189
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,190 
the specified boundaries

190
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,540 
here

191
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,460 
now what we have to figure out is what
the corresponding specifications

192
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,240 
are for the digital filter in the
strategy let me emphasize

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,570 
is dead we have

194
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,390 
situation where we're doing
continuous-time and discrete-time

195
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,130 
processing continuous-time signals

196
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,850 
and we have specifications associated
with that

197
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,150 
that imposes specifications on our
discrete-time

198
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,280 
filter and then we wanted design

199
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,140 
the discrete-time filter using impose
invariance

200
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,360 
and that's the discrete I feel to their
will use the overall system

201
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,120 
right now we want specifications

202
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,500 
on the discrete-time filter

203
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,540 
and we want the continuous overall
equivalent system

204
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,630 
to have certain arm

205
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,290 
meet certain specifications a certain
frequencies related to

206
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,790 
continuous-time frequencies recall

207
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,570 
that when we sample a continuous-time
signal

208
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,280 
is a very specific mapping from the
continuous-time

209
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,590 
frequency axis to the discrete-time
frequency axis

210
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,740 
in particular the sampling frequency

211
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,150 
gets mapped to to Part II

212
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,300 
well that means there are other critical
frequencies get mapped

213
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,960 
in proportion to that so one killer
hurts which is a 10

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,200 
love the sampling frequency with then

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,850 
convert to a discrete-time frequency
love point2 pie

216
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,740 
and one-and-a-half kilohertz will
convert to

217
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,620 
a discreet I frequency love point three
pie

218
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,010 
so what this says is that for the
discrete-time

219
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,130 
filter we would like

220
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,260 
the same behavior

221
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,870 
but at frequencies are the same
specifications

222
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,980 
but at frequencies normalize

223
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,370 
to the discrete-time frequency axis

224
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,360 
that means dead we want the
discrete-time

225
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,750 
frequency Mac frequency response
magnitude

226
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,790 
to be greater than or equal to -1 DB at

227
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,070 
two-tenths pie corresponding to the one
killer hurts and continuous-time

228
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,250 
and four the beginning

229
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,420 
love this top band in that would occur
at point three pie

230
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,220 
at which point we want this less than or
equal to minus 15

231
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,680 
so those are our discreet I
specifications

232
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,300 
and we now wanted design the

233
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,250 
discrete-time filter using impulse and
parents

234
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,120 
now in the polls in variance as you
recall

235
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,630 
it corresponds to

236
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,650 
sampling generating an impulse response
which is a sampled

237
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,790 
version love the continuous-time impulse
response

238
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,620 
and there is a temptation naturally

239
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,210 
to think love this parameter capital T

240
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,650 
as necessarily identical

241
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,650 
to the sampling

242
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,710 
in the system in which the filter is
going to be use

243
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,350 
now this is a fairly subtle complicated
tongue twisting issue

244
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,480 
but the bottom line on at the essential
point

245
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,870 
is that the parameter capital T that we
use in imposing variant

246
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,790 
design as a totally different unrelated

247
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,280 
and in fact as it turns out arbitrary
parameter

248
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,140 
which is not necessarilly pegged

249
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,690 
to the sampling frequency and I think it
would be difficult for me to totally

250
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,340 
clarify that

251
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,560 
during the lecture it's discussed more
the book

252
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,820 
and certainly you should take plenty of
time to reflect on

253
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,020 
for it but let's no look then

254
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,710 
at where we are in our design procedure

255
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,530 
and specifically what it is that we need
to do

256
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,580 
in order to design the digital

257
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,580 
Butterworth filter now we have

258
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,670 
a set of specifications there we

259
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,300 
we've generated relating essentially to

260
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,340 
how we want the passband if the digital
filter

261
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,090 
and the stop and above the digital
filter to behave

262
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,670 
course since this isn't an ideal filter

263
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,870 
it has sound transitions from passband
to stop and

264
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,790 
and as we discussed last time there is

265
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,180 
aliasing which we need to at least
beware oath

266
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,580 
we specified certain frequencies along
this axis

267
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,250 
which are easily converted by

268
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,159 
relating the the two axes through this
mapping

269
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,209 
are you easily related back to

270
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,319 
the continuous-time

271
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,049 
frequency axis as we have here

272
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,559 
and in particular now if we

273
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,809 
word is simply pick that parameter in
the imposing variant design capital T

274
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:35,020 
as equal to unity and I indicated just a
minute ago that we can pick it

275
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,919 
arbitrarily

276
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,070 
if I a pic is unity then the procedure
which consists

277
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,600 
about designing the continuous-time
Butterworth filter

278
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,210 
with meeting the pro or exceeding the
appropriate specifications

279
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,080 
and then going through the imposing
variant procedure

280
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,070 
alright so let's do that then

281
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,149 
we want the discrete-time impulse
response to be the continuous-time

282
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:11,080 
paul's response sampled and for
convenience I'm going to pick this

283
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,600 
parameter capital T equal to 1

284
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,289 
that means dead the frequency
normalization between

285
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,779 
the discrete-time frequency axis and the
continuous-time

286
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,399 
frequency axis in fact is

287
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,950 
those axes are scaled identically
because

288
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,610 
capital T is equal to 1 and so now

289
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,559 
we want the analog for continuous-time

290
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,809 
specifications and so what we need to do
then

291
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,389 
is design a Butterworth filter I'm using
capital be here again to denote

292
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:51,120 
the frequency response the Butterworth
filter the Butterworth filter

293
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,309 
to have a magnitude which is greater
than or equal to -1 DB

294
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,600 
prior to the frequency 0.2 pie

295
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,350 
and less than or equal to -15 at a
frequency

296
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,779 
beyond 0.3 part

297
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:12,789 
and so now what we need to do is
determine

298
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,100 
capital and and Omega subsea

299
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,200 
in order to meet or exceed the
specifications

300
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,570 
now if you go through The Associated
algebra doing at let's say that

301
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,649 
you decide that you want a pic capital
and omega-6

302
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:32,350 
see to exactly meet those inequalities
at

303
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,799 
the to frequencies point to point point
three pie

304
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,820 
what you'll find after going through the
algebra

305
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,820 
is that there exactly Matt

306
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,009 
if capital and is 5.88

307
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,190 
and omega-6 see is point 7047

308
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,570 
and this obviously can't

309
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,690 
is in satisfactory as parameters for the
Butterworth filter

310
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,860 
why is that the reason is

311
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,389 
that capital and isn't an integer and in

312
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,499 
the class a Butterworth filters to
generate a rational transfer function

313
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,220 
capital N this parameter must be an
integer

314
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,809 
so since it can't be 5.88

315
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:19,169 
the natural thing to do is to move it up

316
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:22,279 
to the next closest integer namely 6

317
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,419 
and that means that will end up with a
filter that goes even better

318
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,190 
in the specifications on the other hand

319
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,249 
there's something kinda underneath the
surface

320
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,320 
dead is inherent in the impulsive area
design procedure

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,759 
namely the fact dad there will always be
some aliasing

322
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,409 
so one strategy and a natural one often

323
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,490 
imposing variant design is to

324
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,990 
shoes and as the next highest integer as
I've done

325
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,539 
and then shoes the parameter omega-6 see

326
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:03,840 
so that the passband specifications

327
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,230 
are exactly met and the stop and
specifications are then slightly

328
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,190 
exceeded

329
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,850 
and that will leave some margin for
releasing

330
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,440 
right now continuing this example then

331
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,909 
how would we complete the design

332
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,509 
well we know what are two parameters

333
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,490 
capital and and omega-6

334
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,190 
CR in that means that we can determine
BFS

335
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,749 
times be at minus s those polls are
located

336
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:42,220 
on a circle in the complex s plane

337
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,350 
and the polls on that circle are paired

338
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,679 
Sat some being associated with BFS and
some would be a minus s

339
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,799 
and in particular to determined be a
badass

340
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,269 
we would simply take the polls

341
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,980 
on the portion of the circle it's in the
left after the S

342
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,279 
point now

343
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,840 
with active service is a

344
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,779 
butterworth continuous-time filter

345
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,779 
which we're then mapping to impose
invariance

346
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,860 
with capital T equal to 1 to

347
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,730 
a discrete-time filter that
discrete-time filter

348
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,159 
to be used in a system

349
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,360 
which has disassociated sampling
frequency

350
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,619 
which is 10 killer hurts

351
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,749 
so to get the discrete-time filter then

352
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:41,889 
we first determine be a vast as we just
did

353
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:45,340 
or at least they indicated how to do it

354
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,720 
we would then expand that out in a
partial fraction expansion

355
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,399 
and then apply the imposing variant
procedure

356
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:58,070 
which consists love mapping the polls

357
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,749 
in the S plane to polls in the seaplane
at locations either the s2k

358
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,320 
capital T your capital T is equal to 1

359
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,220 
and retaining the residue where the
coefficients

360
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,299 
in the expansion and this ban

361
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,779 
will give us the transfer function for
the discrete-time

362
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:21,070 
filter so

363
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,360 
if in fact we

364
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,999 
did at than the resulting frequency
response

365
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,059 
that we would get is what i've indicated
here

366
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:36,200 
and I indicated first on a magnitude

367
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,980 
scale linear magnitude scale and second

368
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,509 
on a like a rhythmic scale and

369
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,799 
as we had originally specified the
digital filter

370
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,090 
is supposed to be greater than a recall
to

371
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,460 
-1 dB at point to pie and less than or
equal to -15

372
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,559 
the be at point three pie

373
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,749 
and in fact this slightly exceeds the
specifications

374
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:07,950 
since we had purposely allowed some
margin

375
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:14,070 
in this topic

376
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,149 
now this is an illustration of the
impulse invariant procedure

377
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:23,749 
and it has a number very nice properties
one of which is that

378
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:28,070 
it takes a continuous-time filter
frequency response

379
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,190 
and it converts it to a discrete-time
frequency response which

380
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,600 
in the absence Bailey is saying looks
identical except for linear frequency

381
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,450 
scale change and in fact we pick capital
T equal to one in there is no scale

382
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,529 
change

383
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:47,039 
it has the major disadvantage

384
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,989 
dead there is always daily as saying and
for some

385
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:55,799 
design for some problems for example if
the filter we're trying to design

386
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,119 
is not ban limited or low pass

387
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,809 
then the alias saying will actually
become intolerable

388
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,659 
well there's another design procedure
which I now want to introduce

389
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,659 
which totally avoids the problems have
aliasing

390
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,369 
but obviously then has its own costs
associated with

391
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:19,789 
and that procedure is referred to as

392
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:24,450 
the by linear transformation

393
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,820 
the by linear transformation which our
own

394
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,840 
try to drive here in any detail

395
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,659 
is a mapping love continuous-time
filters

396
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,190 
to discrete-time filters corresponding

397
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,769 
to taking the applause transform
variable ass

398
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:47,950 
in the continuous-time filter and
replacing it

399
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,600 
by what is referred to as a file in your
function at z

400
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,970 
and so if I substitute this in here

401
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,379 
that will give me the discrete-time
frequency response

402
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,710 
again in this procedure there's a primer
capital T

403
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,369 
which again is totally irrelevant given
the approach that we're taking

404
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,129 
and which we will generally tend to
normalize out to unity

405
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:17,610 
and let me just say quickly and passing

406
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,929 
dead although we all go through this the

407
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,239 
notion of the by linear transformation

408
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:27,429 
can be tied to the concept love

409
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,649 
taking the differential equation for the
continuous-time

410
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:36,190 
filter converting it to an integral
equation by integrating

411
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,190 
enough times on both sides

412
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,619 
and then converting Matt to

413
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:46,659 
a difference equation by approximating

414
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,210 
the integrals with the trapezoidal rule

415
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,299 
and that in effect will correspond

416
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,039 
to mapping the continuous-time filter to
a discrete-time

417
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,450 
filter with the by linear transformation
well we'll just focus on

418
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,840 
the properties love the mapping and in
particular

419
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,049 
if we were to substitute into

420
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:16,049 
the expression see equal to you DJ Omega
corresponding to the unit circle

421
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,909 
we would find dead the unit circle

422
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:24,840 
in discrete-time corresponds to mapping

423
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,279 
DJ Omega axis in continuous-time which
is exactly

424
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,399 
what we want now the mapping

425
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,049 
between the continuous-time frequency

426
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,190 
and the discrete-time frequency

427
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,360 
is a nonlinear mapping which

428
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,539 
is given by the algebraic expression
that I indicate here

429
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:51,350 
and if we plot this mapping

430
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,929 
but we have is this Kurt

431
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:00,059 
and what this corresponds to then

432
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:06,489 
is a mapping cause the J Omega axis or
continuous time-frequency

433
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:10,299 
to discrete-time frequency

434
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:14,879 
and if we think more generally oath the
mapping represented by the by a linear

435
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,730 
transformation

436
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,799 
in the context of the S plane in the
seaplane

437
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,100 
it corresponds to mapping

438
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,109 
DJ Omega axis in the S plane

439
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:30,029 
to what's around the unit circle in the
seaplane

440
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:33,629 
and you can also convince yourself

441
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,320 
that the left after the S plane maps

442
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,460 
to the inside the unit circle and

443
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,619 
so that means dead stable

444
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,659 
continuous-time filters will always map
to stable

445
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,309 
discrete-time filters which is exactly
what we desire

446
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,100 
now notice in this that there's no issue
avail yes and what's happened is

447
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,690 
that we've replaced espy function FZ
corresponds to

448
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,539 
mapping BS point too busy playing fact
the whole J Omega axes

449
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,659 
has mapped to once around the unit
circle

450
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:15,259 
which obviously requires some type of
nonlinear mapping because

451
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,629 
like the jamming axis is infinitely long

452
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:21,629 
the unit circle has a fine I radius

453
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,970 
and so essentially what has to happen is
if you think

454
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,019 
love walking along the continuous-time

455
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:33,269 
frequency axis and simultaneously
walking around the unit circle

456
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,529 
if you walk at a constant rate around
the unit circle

457
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:40,440 
and your simultaneously walking up the
jam a axis

458
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,210 
if you want to get around the pie by the
time

459
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,950 
here you've gotten tune infinity along

460
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,169 
the continuous-time frequency axis you
better

461
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:55,859 
wats kittens are walking faster faster
faster because you've got

462
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,369 
an infinite distance to cover while you
just go over a finite distance here

463
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:04,889 
well worldwide says really is that

464
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:08,759 
that's why in fact we're taking

465
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,730 
the entire or were able to take the
entire

466
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,369 
Omega axis and just map it into an
interval

467
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:22,980 
all above link pie

468
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,340 
right now that means that their

469
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,350 
is a nonlinear distortion of the
frequency axis

470
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,720 
if we were to take a continuous I filter
and converted to

471
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,879 
a discrete type filter with the by a
linear transformation

472
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:41,320 
how do we account for that were for that
matter

473
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,169 
when can we really use it and

474
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,570 
we can see how to had a both take
account of it

475
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,200 
and what its limitations are by

476
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,710 
recognizing the following suppose that

477
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,789 
I wanted design a

478
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,659 
discretized salter and

479
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:07,419 
what is going to happen is that it will
be mapped to a continuous-time filter

480
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,840 
the relationship between

481
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,279 
the two frequency axes will be given by
this Kurt

482
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,470 
so let's supposed dead the

483
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,869 
continuous-time frequency response looks
as I've shown here

484
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:27,899 
with a passband cutoff frequency and its
top and cut-off frequency

485
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,980 
if this were mapped

486
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,279 
through the by a linear transformation
to

487
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,019 
a discrete-time filter then this cutoff
frequency

488
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,759 
would fall over here

489
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,090 
which is related through this curve and

490
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,169 
this cutoff frequency to stop and age

491
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,940 
would be here again reflected it's these
frequencies reflected

492
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,940 
through this skirt

493
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,899 
so let's suppose now that what I'd like
to do is design

494
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:07,710 
a discrete-time filter where the
discrete-time filter has

495
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,960 
certain frequency specifications

496
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,029 
which is what are previous example has

497
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:17,379 
it has let's say a specified stop and
age

498
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:23,080 
as specified past bandage and assess
specified stop and age

499
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,580 
the design procedure within correspond
to

500
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,070 
mapping those frequencies

501
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,259 
to the corresponding continuous-time
frequencies

502
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,340 
designing the continuous-time filter

503
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,629 
to me this specification space

504
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:46,489 
on those critical frequencies

505
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:50,100 
then taking the continuous-time design

506
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,850 
and mapping it back to a discrete I
filter

507
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,559 
through the by linear transformation

508
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,769 
right now what we want to do is

509
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:05,119 
again map a Butterworth filter
continuous-time Butterworth filter to

510
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,759 
to a digital filter in such a way that
the digital filter approximately

511
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,720 
meets the specifications that we had
before

512
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,729 
and let me just remind you love where we
were

513
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:21,830 
the critical frequencies were at 0.2 pie

514
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,200 
and 0.3 pie and

515
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,820 
what we had asked for is dead the
frequency response

516
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,440 
be down by no more than one dB

517
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200 
up 2.2 pie and down by

518
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,570 
at least 15 TV at Point three-part

519
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,340 
so we want to design the same

520
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,460 
discrete-time filter as we did before
with imposing variance

521
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,779 
we now want to do it with the by linear
transformation

522
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:59,359 
applied to an appropriate butterworth
design

523
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,970 
okay well so let's see what kinda
specifications we have

524
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,220 
we know that the frequency the critical
frequencies are mapped

525
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,540 
through this curve for this equation

526
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,200 
and I indicated again that this
parameter capital T is

527
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,830 
arbitrary in the design procedure

528
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,280 
that may seem confusing initially but

529
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,260 
this some further discussion of it in
the book and it's true an important to

530
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,010 
sort out

531
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,100 
so we're going to pick capital T equal
to unity

532
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,869 
and that means then that the

533
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,879 
corresponding critical frequencies

534
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,020 
all the continuous-time filter

535
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,030 
are at twice but ancient love

536
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,770 
0.2 pie over to and twice the tangent

537
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,909 
love 0.3 pie over to

538
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,920 
so that means then there the
specifications on

539
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,390 
our continuous-time filter

540
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,770 
are given by this sensually

541
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,359 
past fans stop and edges warped through

542
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,569 
that nonlinear curve this nonlinear
curve

543
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,400 
and I'm using capital G here to denote

544
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,930 
the system function for the

545
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,299 
resulting continuous-time salter

546
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:28,750 
and so now we could think of designing a
Butterworth filter

547
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,490 
that lets say exactly meets the
specifications

548
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,869 
well if you do that what you'll find is
dead

549
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,280 
you get exact a quality

550
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,059 
here if you pick capital N

551
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:49,770 
equal to 5.3

552
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,780 
and again we have the issue that

553
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,780 
if we want to meet or exceed the
specifications we can't make

554
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,289 
the filter order lower we have to make
it higher and so

555
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:07,039 
we would make it is so to 5.3 with make
the filter order equal to 6

556
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,270 
and now again we have several

557
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,260 
options and trade-offs before with
imposing variance

558
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,760 
we essentially decided to meet the

559
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,970 
passband specifications and exceed the
stop and specifications

560
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,859 
to provide some margin for aliasing

561
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:30,150 
here we don't have any a leasing

562
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,450 
and we can't ratings of any way we'd
like

563
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,700 
the way that are chosen to do it is to

564
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,890 
exactly me the

565
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,190 
stop and cut off and exceed

566
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,829 
the passband specifications and

567
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,349 
the result to doing that is to choose

568
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,819 
a filter order capital and equal to 6%

569
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:58,960 
and though parameter Omega subsea in the
Butterworth filter

570
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,319 
is given by 0.7 6622

571
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,559 
alright so now we have

572
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,190 
the parameters for

573
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,770 
the continuous-time Butterworth filter

574
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,089 
which when mapped to

575
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:22,460 
the discrete-time filter through the by
linear transformation

576
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,660 
will exceed our requirements in the past
band and Justin

577
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,309 
just me the stop and cut off and so

578
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:34,130 
now we want to complete the design
procedure and

579
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,240 
given the parameters

580
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,900 
up the Butterworth filter we can draw

581
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,339 
are appropriate circle in the S plane
which happens to be the same circle as

582
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:47,170 
before

583
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,750 
but with a different radius and

584
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,210 
then associate polls on this circle

585
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:00,020 
with be a bass and be a minus s in
particular take the ones in the left

586
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,130 
after the S plane

587
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,089 
same ones we had before except we have a
different value for Omega subsea

588
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:10,280 
in and does then represent

589
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,829 
BFS so we can now determine be a badass

590
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:21,390 
and new ones we have the transfer
function be a badass

591
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,589 
we then map that to a

592
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:27,980 
discrete-time filter by mapping through

593
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,049 
the by linear transformation and that
then

594
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:35,260 
is the design procedure through

595
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,339 
which we would follow for this example
by well let's just see what

596
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:44,240 
the result looks like when we're done

597
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,650 
here I show again on both

598
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,940 
a linear magnitude scale in on

599
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,809 
a logarithmic good DB scale the
frequency response

600
00:38:54,809 --> 00:39:00,720 
love the resulting filter and recall
that the specifications were dead 8.2

601
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920 
pie

602
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,500 
we should be down by no more than 1d
being clearly we've exceeded that

603
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,119 
considerably

604
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,400 
and 8.3 pie we should be

605
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,490 
are down by at least 15 DB and we chose
the design so that we would exactly

606
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,190 
meet that edge so we've met this point

607
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,039 
and exceeded this point and this is our
Design

608
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,510 
now let's just compare this

609
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,990 
with the impulse invariant design that
we saw

610
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,809 
a few minutes ago

611
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:38,200 
and the impossibility and design is

612
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,410 
what I indicate here be

613
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,440 
by linear transformation design is

614
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,859 
now overlaid on top of that

615
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:51,390 
it's hard to see much difference on a
linear

616
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,839 
magnitude scale but let's look online
horrific scale

617
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,780 
and this one that I'm lifting is the by
linear transformation

618
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,819 
and this is imposing variance

619
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:07,910 
and notice in fact something very
interesting

620
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,190 
which is dead the sold the

621
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,690 
filter dead we obtained by

622
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,950 
mapping the Butterworth filter to a
digital filter through the by a linear

623
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,619 
transformation

624
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,680 
in fact falls off in frequency

625
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:31,670 
much more rapidly then the one that we
got through imposing variance

626
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,869 
the question is why now one thought that
might come to mind is well we possibly

627
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:40,730 
Reince as a leasing by linear
transformation doesn't have a leasing

628
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,000 
that must be a consequence a daily as
saying

629
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,520 
in fact that's not the reason aliasing
as it turns out in this particular

630
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,079 
design is raw

631
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,450 
was relatively minimal in the opossum
variant design

632
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,640 
the reason has to do with

633
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,029 
is nonlinear mapping in the by a linear
transformation

634
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:06,900 
from the continuous-time frequency to
the discrete-time frequency

635
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,849 
keep in mind dead through then mapping

636
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:15,710 
as you start walking around the unit
circle and moving up the Chi Omega axis

637
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,440 
as you move up the jam make access you
have to move faster faster faster faster

638
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,390 
and what's in continuous-time frequency
and infinity

639
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,900 
is what you get to in a discrete-time
frequency by the time you get around the

640
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900 
park

641
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,890 
so in fact what we're looking at is

642
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,549 
as as we look out along this frequency
axis

643
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:43,900 
is we're seeing

644
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,640 
higher and higher and higher frequencies
in the continuous-time

645
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,329 
filter by the time we get the pie

646
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:55,609 
we should in fact be in the
continuous-time goals are equivalent Lee

647
00:41:55,609 --> 00:42:02,609 
off to infinity which sounds like pretty
uncomfortable place to be

648
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:07,690 
okay now this was a a fairly

649
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,720 
rapid trip through a number of issues

650
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,680 
i in particular some the issues
associated with the filing your

651
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,299 
transformation

652
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:19,349 
and and also this issue

653
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,470 
love how you pick this parameter capital
T and how it might be associated with

654
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,010 
the

655
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,180 
sampling frequency if you doing
discrete-time processing

656
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,380 
a continuous-time signals and we don't
have time

657
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,779 
to explore summer those issues more
fully

658
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:40,270 
in this lecture but in I'd like to
conclude by making a

659
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,630 
couple comments 1 comment is there the

660
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,789 
two techniques that we've talked about
impulse and Berrien center by linear

661
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:49,480 
transformation

662
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,619 
are the two techniques that are
principally

663
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,910 
used when one thinks mapping

664
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,970 
continuous type filters to discrete-time

665
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,930 
filters for whatever application and I
stress again

666
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,380 
that you may want to do that mapping
whether or not

667
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,609 
the discrete-time filter is eventually
going to be used for processing

668
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:15,980 
continuous-time signals

669
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,260 
now imposing variants

670
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,619 
have a characteristic dead it very nice
characteristic that are

671
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:29,059 
that it corresponds to a linear mapping
between the two frequency axes

672
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:32,210 
except for the issue with aliasing

673
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,230 
and that's a problem with that and in
particular limits its usefulness

674
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,349 
to filter designs or for mapping
continuous-time

675
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:46,589 
filters their band limited

676
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:51,420 
on the other hand we have the by linear
transformation as a design procedure

677
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,349 
which totally avoid daily as saying

678
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,220 
but has the disadvantage or difficulty

679
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,230 
better represents a nonlinear mapping
from the continuous type filter

680
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,230 
to the discrete-time filter now this
nonlinear distortion

681
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,140 
is perfectly acceptable if we're
designing

682
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,410 
or attempting to designed filters that
have flack frequency characteristics

683
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,400 
it's not acceptable if for example we
had a linear frequency characteristic

684
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,180 
that we wanted to map to discreet I
filter and end up with a linear

685
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,809 
frequency characteristic

686
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,539 
it won't come out to be linear because
all

687
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:34,260 
this nonlinear mapping at the frequency
axis

688
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,589 
now in there are also

689
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:41,309 
a number of other design procedures
which we won't go into

690
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:45,109 
for designing discrete-time filters and
among them

691
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:49,970 
are a variety of techniques including
