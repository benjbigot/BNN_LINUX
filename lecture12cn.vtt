00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
with the output olaf for the equalizer just being the summer the outputs from

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
across here
这里对面

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in effect shows you what the frequency response to the equalizer is

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
make it more interesting a not the my voice is an interesting as it is

the difference equation let's say for a three-point moving average

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
we would take three adjacent points an average though
我们将采取三个相邻点的平均，虽然

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
that would give us the output at The Associated time
这将使我们在相关的时间输出

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and then to compute the next output point we were just simply slide this
