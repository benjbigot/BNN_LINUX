for in the last lecture

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I introduced an illustrated the kinds of signals and systems that will be dealing

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
throughout this course in today's lecture I'd like to

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
be a little more specific and in particular talk about

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
some the basic signals both continuous-time and discrete-time

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that will form important building blocks as

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the course progresses let's begin

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
with one signal the continuous-time sinusoidal signal which perhaps you're

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
already

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
somewhat familiar with mathematically

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the continuous-time sinusoidal signal is expressed as i've indicated here

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
there are three parameters

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
a Omega 0 and see the parameter a is referred to as

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the ample to the parameter Omega 0

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
as the frequency and the parameter fee

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as the face and

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
graphically the continuous-time sinusoidal signal has the form

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
shown here now

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the sinusoidal signal has a number love

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
important properties that will find it convenient to exploit as the

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
course goes along one of which is

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the fact that the sinusoidal signal

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is what is referred to as periodic what I mean by periodic

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is that under inappropriate time shift which I indicate here

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
as t0 the signal replicates

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
or repeats itself force it another way

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
if we shift the time origin by an appropriate amount

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
t0 the smallest value t0 being referred to as the period

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then X 50 is equal to itself shifted and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to demonstrate that we can demonstrated mathematically

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
by simply substituting into the mathematical expression for the

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
sinusoidal signal

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
see plus capital T zero

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
in place if T when we carry out the expansion

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we then have for the argument the sinusoid

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Omega 0t plus Omega 0

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
capital T zero plus P now

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
one of the things that we know about sinusoidal functions

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is dead if you change the argument by any integer multiple

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to pie and the function has the same value

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and so we can exploit that here in particular

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
with Omega 0t0 and integer multiple

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
up to par i then the right hand side of this equation

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is equal to the left hand side of the equation so

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
with Omega 0t0 equal to two part times an integer

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or t0 equal to two part times an integer

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
divided by Omega 0 the signal repeats the period is defined as the smallest

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
value if t0 and so the period is to pie

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
divided by Omega 0 and going back to

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
are sinusoidal signal we can

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
see that and

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
i've indicated here then the period

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
as to pie over Omega 0 and that's the bad you

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
under which the signal repeats now

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in addition a useful

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
property above the sinusoidal signal is the fact that

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
a timeshare all a sinusoid

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
is equivalent to a phase change and we can demonstrate

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that again mathematically in particular

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
if we put the sinusoidal signal under

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
a timeshare i've indicated that the probe the time shift that i'm talking

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
about. by small t0

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and expand this out then

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
we see that that is equivalent to

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
a change in phase and important thing to recognize

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
about this statement is that not only is a timeshare

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
generating a phase change but in fact

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
if we inserted a phase change

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
there is always a value if t0

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which would correspond to

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
an equivalent I'm ship said another way

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
if retake Omega 0t0

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and think of that as are change in phase

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
for any change in phase we can solve this equation for timeshift

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
or conversely for any value timeshare that

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
represents an appropriate face

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
so a time shift corresponds to a phase change

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and a phase change likewise corresponds to it I'm ship

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and so for example if we

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
look at the sinusoidal signal

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the general sinusoidal signal that we

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
saw previously in effect changing the phase

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
corresponds to moving this signal in time

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
one way or the other for example if we look at the sinusoidal signal with

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a phase equal to 0 that corresponds

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to locating the time origin at this p

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and i've indicated that on

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the following grass

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
so here we have illustrated a sinusoid

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
with zero phase or cosine with zero phase

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
corresponding to taking a general picture and shifting it

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
shifting it appropriately as i've indicated here

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
this of course still has the property that it's a periodic function

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
since we simply displaced in time

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and by looking at the graph what we see is that it has another very important

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
property

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
a property referred to as even and

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that's a property that will find it useful in general

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to refer to in relation to signals a signal is said to be even

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
if when we reflected about the origin it looks exactly the same so it's a metric

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
about the origin and looking at

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
this sinusoid that in fact has that property

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and mathematically this statement that it's even is equivalent to the statement

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that if we replace the time argument

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
by its negative the function itself

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
doesn't change

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
now this corresponded to a phase shift 0 in our original

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
cosine expression if instead we had

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
chosen a phase shift love let's say minus pie over to

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then is that a a cosigner so it'll signal

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
well we would generate is a sinusoid

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with the appropriate phase or

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
said another way if we take are

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
original cosine and

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
substitute in for the phase minus pie over to

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
then of course we have this mathematical expression

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
using just straight for trigonometric identities

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
we can express that alternately as signed Omega 0t

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the frequency and amplitude of course haven't changed and

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that you can convince yourself also is equivalent

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to shifting the cosine by

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and a mountain time that I've indicated here namely

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
a quarter of the period so illustrated below

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
is the graph now when

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
we have a phase of mine espy over to an arc cosine

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
which is a sinusoidal signal of course it's still

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
periodic its periodic with a period of two pi

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
over Omega 0 again because all that we've done

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
by introducing a phase change is

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
introduce the timeshare now

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
when we look at the sinusoid in comparison with the Cosi namely with

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
this particular choice a phase

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
this has a different symmetry and

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that symmetry is referred to as odd what ought symmetry means

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
graphically is that when we flipped the signal

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
about the origin

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
but I margin we also multiply it by a minus sign

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so thats in effect antisymmetric

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
it it's not the mirror image but it's the mirror image flipped over

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and will find many occasions not only to refer to signals more general and

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
sinusoidal signals as

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
even in some cases and odd in other cases

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and in general mathematically

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
on signal is one which

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
has satisfy is the algebraic expression

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that exit see when you replace

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
TE by its negative is equal to

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
minus exit -2 so replacing the argument by its negative

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
corresponds to time River I A

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
an algebraic sign rivers

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
okay so in this is the class of continuous-time

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
sinusoids will have a little more to say about it later

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but I've now like to turn to

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
discrete-time sinusoids what we'll see is that discrete-time sinusoids

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
are very much like continuous-time ones but also

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
with some very important differences and we want to focus not only on the

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
similarities

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but also on the differences well let's begin

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with the mathematical expression a

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
discrete-time sinusoidal signal mathematically

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is as i've indicated here a cosine

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Omega 0 and plus the and just says

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in the continuous-time case the parameter

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a is what we refer to as the airport to

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Omega 0 as the frequency and see

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
as the face

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I've illustrated

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
here several discrete-time

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
sinusoidal signals and they kinda

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
look similar in fact if you sort of track what you might think of is the

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
envelope

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
it looks very much like what a continuous-time sign outside so it might

00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
look like

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but keep in mind day at the independent variable in this case

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
isn't integer variable and so

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the sequence in fact only takes on bag use

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
at integer values up the argument and we'll see

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that that has a a very important

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
implication and will see that shortly now

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
one of the issues that we addressed in the continuous-time cases periodicity

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and I want to refer or return to that

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
shortly because that is in fact one of the areas where there is an important

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
distinction

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
let's first

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
though examine the statement similar to the one

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the week salmon for continuous-time namely the relationship between the time

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
shift in a phase change

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
now in continuous-time

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
course we saw that a timeshare corresponds to a phase change in

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
vice versa let's first look at

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the relationship between shifting time and generating a change in phase

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in particular for discrete-time if

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in fact I implement a timeshare that

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
generates a phase change and we can see that

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
easily by simply inserting a timeshare

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
employs an 0 and if we expand at this argument we have

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Omega 0 and plus Omega 0n0

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and so I've done that on the right hand side of the equation

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
year and the

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Omega 0n0 then simply corresponds to

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
a change in phase so clearly

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
a shift in time generates

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
a change in phase and

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
for example if we take a particular

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
sinusoidal signal let's say we take the cosine signal

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
at a particular frequency and with a phase equal to 0

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
a sequence that we might generate is

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
one that I've illustrated here so

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
when I'm illustrating here is the cosine

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
signal with 0 theta is

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and it has a particular

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
behavior to it which will depend someone on the frequency

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if I now take this same sequence

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and shifted so that the time origin

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
shifted a quarter of a period away then

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you can convince yourself and it's straightforward

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
to work out that that timeshare corresponds to a phase shift

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
of pie over to so

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
in that case with the cosine

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
with a phase minus pie over to

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that will correspond to the expression

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that I have here

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
we can alternately right that using a get a trigonometric identity as sin

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
as a sign function and that I've stated

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
is equivalent to a timeshare

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
namely this shift the pirate to is equal to an

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a certain time share and the timeshare for this particular example

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is in fact the quarter the period

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
so here we have

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the sinusoid previously we had the cosine

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the cosine was exactly the same sequence but with the Argent located here

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and in fact that's exactly the way we drew this graph namely

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
we just simply took the same values and change the time origin

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
now looking at this sequence which is the

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
sinusoidal sequence the phase

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
-5 over to that has a certain symmetry and in fact what we see is that

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
it has an oximetry just as in the continuous-time case

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
namely if we take that sequence flip it about the axis

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and flip it over and sign then we get the same sequence back

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
whereas with zero phase corresponding

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
to the cosine that I show previously that hasn't even symmetry

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
namely if I flipped about the time margin

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and don't do it sign reversal then the sequences maintain

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
so here we have

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and on symmetry expressed mathematically

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
as i've indicated namely

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
replacing the independent variable by its negative

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
attach is a negative sign to the whole sequence

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
whereas in a previous case

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
what we have is 0 phase

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and and even symmetry

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and that's expressed Mac mathematically as exit and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
equals X -8

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
okay now one of the things I said so far about discrete-time sinusoids is dead

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
a timeshare corresponds to a phase change

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and weekend then ask whether

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the river statement is also true and we knew that the river statement was true

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in continuous-time

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
specifically is a true

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that a phase change

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
always corresponds with time shift

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
now we know that that is true namely that this statement works both ways

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
in continuous-time does it in discrete-time

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
well the answer somewhat

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
interestingly are surprisingly into you sit down and think about it

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
is no dead it is not

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
necessarily true and discrete-time that any phase change

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
can be interpreted as a simple time-shifted the sequence

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and let me just indicate what the problem is

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
if we look

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
at the relationship between the left side on the right side of this equation

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
expanding this out as we did previously we have that Omega 0n

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
plus Omega 0n0 must correspond to Omega 0n plus

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
p and so on make 0n0

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
must correspond to the phase-change now

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
which you can see pretty clearly is there'd depending

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
on the relationship between see an Omega

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
n0 may or may not come out to be an integer

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
now in continuous-time

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the amount of time shift did not have to be an integer a map

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
indiscreet time when we talk about a timeshare the amount of time shift

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
obviously because the nature discrete-time signals

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
must be an integer so the face changes related to time shifts

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
must satisfy this particular relationship

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
namely that Omega 0n0

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
were n0 is an integer is equal to the changing face

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
okay now that's one distinction between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
let's now focus on another one namely the

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
issue of periodicity and what we'll see

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
is that again whereas in continuous-time

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
all continuous-time sinusoids our periodic

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in the discrete-time case that is not necessarily true

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
to

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
explore that little more carefully let's

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
looked at the expression again for a general sinusoidal signal with

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
an arbitrary effort to frequency and phase

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and for this to be periodic

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
what we require is that there be some value capital and

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
under which one we shift the sequence by that amount

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
we get the same sequence back again and the smallest value capital and

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
is what we've defined as the period now

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
when we try that on a sinusoid we've core substitute in

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
for and little and little and plus capital and

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and when we expand out the argument

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
here we'll get

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the argument that I have on the right hand side

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and in order for

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
this to repeat in other words in order for a press in effect

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to discard this term Omega 0 times capital and where capital is the period

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
must be an integer multiple a two-part and

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
in that case its periodic as long as

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Omega 0 times capital and capital in being the period

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is to provide times an integer just simply dividing this out

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
we have capital in the period is to pie am

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
divided by Omega 0 well

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
you can say okay what's the big deal a whatever capital and happens to come out

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to be when we do that a little bit about your bro that's the period

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but in fact capital and or 2 p.m. divided by Omega 0

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
may not ever come out to be an integer or may not come out to be the one that

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you thought it might

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
for example let's look at

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
some particular sinusoidal signals

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
but say we have the first one here

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
which is a sinusoid as I've shown

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and it has a frequency what i've referred to as the frequency

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Omega 0 equal to two pi divided by 12

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and what we'd like to look at

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
is to pry divided by Omega 0

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
in effect then find an integer to multiply that by

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
in order to get another manager let's just try that here

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
if we look at to prioritize make a zero

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to pry over Omega 0 for this case is equal to 12

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
well that's fine 12 is an integer

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so what that says in fact is that this sinusoidal

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
signal is periodic and in fact this period periodic with period of 12

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
all right let's look at the next one

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the next one we would have to pile for Omega 0

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
again and that's equal to 31 fourths

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
so with that says

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
is that the period is 31 forts wait a minute

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
30 1/4 isn't an integer we have to multiply that by an injured

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to get another integer well we multiply that by four

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
so to pile from a guys there are ties for is 3131 is an integer

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and so what that says is this is periodic not with the period up to par

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
over make a zero

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
by with a period love to pie

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
over Omega 0 times for namely with the period

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll 31 finally

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
let's take an exam the example where Omega 0z call to a6

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
as shown here that actually looks if you track it with a ride like its periodic

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to pile over Omega 0 in that case

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
is equal to 12 pie well

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
what integer can I multiplied 12 pie

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
by and get another integer the answer is none

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because pi is an irrational number so in fact

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
what that says is that if you look at

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
this sinusoidal signal it's not periodic at all

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
even though you might for yourself into thinking it is

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
simply because the envelope looks periodic namely the

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
continuous-time acquittal with this is periodic

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
the discrete-time sequence is not

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
okay well we've seen then some

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
important distinctions between continuous-time sinusoidal signals

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and discrete-time sinusoidal signals the first one

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
is the fact that in the continuous-time case

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
a time-shifted phase change are always equivalent

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
where's the discrete-time case in effect that works one way

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but not the other way we've also

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
seen that for a continuous-time signal

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the continuous-time signal is always periodic

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
whereas the discrete-time signal is not necessarily

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
in particular for the continuous-time case

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
if we have a general expression for the sinusoidal signal

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that i've indicated here that's periodic

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
for any choice Omega 0 whereas

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
in a discrete-time case its periodic

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
only air Omega 0 is to Poway

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
well the only if

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to pie over Omega 0 can be multiplied by integer

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
to get another injured now another

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
important and as it turns out useful distinction

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
between the continuous-time and discrete-time case

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is the fact that in the discrete-time

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
case as we very what I've called the frequency Omega 0

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
we only see

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
distinct signals as omega 0

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
varies over a two-party interval and if we let Omega 0

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
very outside the Rangers let's say mine despite a pirate 0 to 2pi

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
will see the same sequences all over again

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
even though at first glance the mathematical expression might look

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
different

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
so in the discrete-time case

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this classes signals

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
is identical for values Omega 0

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
separated by two pi whereas

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
in a continuous-time case that is not true

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
in particular if I consider the sinusoidal continuous-time signals

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
as I very Omega 0

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
what will happen is that I will always see

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
different sinusoidal signals namely these won't be

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and in in effect we can justify

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
that statement algebraically and

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I will take the time to do it carefully but

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
let's look first the mall at the discrete-time

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
case and a statement that I'm making is that

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
if I have to discrete-time sinusoidal signals

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
at two different frequencies and if these frequencies

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
are separated by an integer multiple to Pine namely

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
if Omega to is equal to Omega one-plus

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
to pie times in integer when

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I substitute this into this expression

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
because it the fact that n is also an integer

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
all have am times and as an integer multiple a two-part

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and that term of course will disappear because the periodicity

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the sinusoid and these two sequences will be equal

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
on the other hand in the continuous-time case

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
since this is not restricted to be an integer variable

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
since T is not restricted to be an integer variable

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
for different values I'll Omega wanna make it to

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the sinusoidal signals will always be different

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
okay now many of the issues that I praise

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
so far in relation to sinusoidal signals are elaborated on

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
in more detail in the text and of course you'll have an opportunity

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
to exercise so this

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
as you worked through the video course manual

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
let me stress that

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
sinusoidal signals will play an extremely important role

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
for us as building blocks for general signals

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and descriptions systems and leaves the whole concept

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
all four EA an ala Cys which is very heavily exploited

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
throughout the course

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
what i'd now like to turn to in is

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
another class love important building blocks

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and in fact will see that under certain conditions these relate strongly to

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
sinusoidal signals

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
namely the Class A real in complex exponentials

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
let me begin first the ball with

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
the real exponential and

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
in particular in the continuous-time case a real continuous-time exponential

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
is mathematically expressed as I

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
indicate year X if T all to see

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
you to the eighty where for

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the real exponential C&A

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
are real numbers and that's what we mean by the real exponential

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
up shortly will also consider complex exponentials where these numbers can

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
then

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
become complex so this is an exponential

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
function and for example

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
if the parameter a is positive

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that means that we have growing exponential function

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
if the parameter a is negative than

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that means dead we have a decaying

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
exponential function now

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
some weight as an aside its kinda interesting to note

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
that for exponentials a timeshare

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
corresponds to a scale change which

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
is somewhat different than what happens with sinusoids

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
in the sinusoidal case we saw that a timeshare

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
corresponded to a phase change the real exponential a timeshare

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
as it turns out corresponds to simply changing the scale

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
there's nothing particularly a

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
crucial or exciting about that and in fact

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
perhaps stressing it is a little misleading for general functions of

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
course

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
about all that you can say about what happens when you

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
implement a timeshare is that implements a time ship

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
okay so here's the real exponential

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
just CE to the eighty let's

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
look at the real exponential now in the discrete-time

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
case and in the discrete-time case

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we have several alternate ways

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
love expressing it we can

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
express the real exponential in the four

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
see be to the beta N or

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
as will find more convenient in part for reason at all indicate shortly

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
we can rewrite this as see time's alpha to the end where course

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
alpha is equal to me to the beta

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
more typically in a discrete-time case will express

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
the exponential as see times

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
alpha to the end so for example this becomes

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
essentially a geometric series a progression

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
as an continues for certain values about

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
for here for example we have

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
for alpha greater than 0

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
first the ball on the top the case where the magnitude about the

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is greater than one so that

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
this the sequence is exponentially

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
geometrically growing on the bottom again without the positive

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
but now with its magnitude less than 1

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
we have a geometric progression

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that is exponentially or geometrically

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
became okay so this

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
in both these cases is with alpha greater than 0

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
now the functional were talking about is alpha to the N

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and of course which you can see is that if al Phys negative is that a positive

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
then when in is even

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that minus sign is gonna disappear when is Eid

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
there will be a minus sign it so for alpha negative

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the sequences good alternate positive and negative ads

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
so for example here we have

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
alpha negative

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and with this magnitude less than one and you can see that

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
again its envelope the case geometrically

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and the values alternate in sin

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and here we have the magnitude about the greater than one

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
without the negative again they alternate in signing of course

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
its growing geometrically

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
now if you think about alpha positive

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and go back to the expression that I have at the top

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
namely see times alpha to the end

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
with alpha positive

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
you can see a straightforward relationship between

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
alpha and beta family beta is

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the logarithm natural logarithm a valve

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
something to think about is what happens

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
if alpha is negative which is of course a very

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
important and useful class love real discreet I'm exponentials also

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
well it turns out that without the negative if you try to express it as see

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
me to the beta and then fag beta comes out to be an imaginary number

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and bad is one but not the only reason

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
why in the discrete-time case its of the most convenient

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
to phrase real exponentials

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
in the for alpha to the end rather than

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you to the beta and in other words to express them

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
in this form rather than in this for

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
okay now let's those are real exponentials continuous-time and

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
discrete-time

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
now let's look at the continuous-time

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
complex exponential and

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
what I mean by a complex exponential

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
again is an exponential the for

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
see you to the eighty him but in this case

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
we allow the parameters C&A to be

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
complex numbers and let's just track this throughout your break Lee

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
CNA a complex numbers let's write see in polar form so it has

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
a magnet to an angle let's write a and rectangular form so it has a real part

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in an imaginary part and when we substitute these two

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
in here combined some things together

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'll actually having combined yet I have this

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
for the amplitude for the effort to factor

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and this for the exponential factor I can now put a lot of this

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
the term corresponding to eat to the RT

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and combine the imaginary parts together and I come down to the expression that I

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
have here

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
so following this for their

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
a an exponential this form you to the J

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Omega were either the JC

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
using Oilers relation can be expressed

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
as the some Ave cosine

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
was GA times assign

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and so that corresponds to this factor

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and then their is this time varying amplitude factor on top of that

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
finally putting those together we end up with the expression

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that I show on the bottom and what this corresponds to

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
are to sinusoidal signals

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
ninety degrees out of phase as indicated by the fact is a cosine and sine

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
so there's a real part in an imaginary part

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
with sinus or does comp on its ninety degrees out of phase

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and a time varying amplitude factor

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
which is a real exponential so it's a sinusoid

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
multiplied by real exponential in both the real part in the imaginary part

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and let's just see what one of those terms might look like

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but i've indicated at the top

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
is a sinusoidal signal

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
with and exponential time very exponential

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
on below or an envelope which is a real

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
exponential and in particular which is growing namely with are greater than 0

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and on the bottom i've indicated

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the same thing with are less than zero and

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
this kinda sinusoidal signal by the way

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
is typically referred to as a damped sinusoids in

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
so what are negative what we have in the real and imaginary parts

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
are damped sinusoids and

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
the sinusoidal compliments at that are ninety degrees out of phase

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
in the real part and in the imaginary part okay now

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
in the discrete-time case we have more or less

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the same kinda outcome in particular

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
what will make reference to

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
are complex exponentials in a discrete-time

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
case the expression for the complex exponential

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
looks very much like the expression for the real exponential

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
except that now we have complex

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
factors so see an alpha

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
are complex numbers and again

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
if we tracked through the algebra

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and get to a point where we have

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
a real exponential multiplied by a factor

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
which is a purely imaginary exponential

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
apply Oilers relationship so this

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
we then finally come down to a

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
sequence which has a real exponential

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
ample to multiplying

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
once I saw it in the real part and in the imaginary part

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
exit exactly the same kind of exponential

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
multiplying a sinusoid thats

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
ninety degrees out of phase from that

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and so if we look at what why these factors might look like

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
its what we would expect given

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
kind of the analogy with the continuous-time case

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
namely its an exponential or rather a sinusoidal

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
sequence with the a

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
real exponential on below in the case were alpha

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
is positive then is a growing on below

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
in the case were out there is negative I'm sorry

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
where the magnitude of alpha mang to ralph is greater than one

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
is a growing exponential are below with a magnitude about the

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
is less than 1 its a decaying

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
exponential are below and so I demonstrated that here

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
here we have the magnitude about the greater than one

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and here we have the magnitude about the less than 1

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
in both cases sinusoidal sequences underneath the envelope

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and then an envelope and is dictated

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
by what the magnitude about its

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
okay now in the discrete-time

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
case then we have results similar to the continuous-time case

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
namely comp own it's a real or imaginary part

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
that have a real exponential factor times

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
a sinusoid of course

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
if the magnitude of alpha is

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
less than 1 I'm sorry the main to mouth is equal to 1

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
then this factor disappears

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
always equal to one in this factor is equal to 1

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and so we have sinusoids in both the real and imaginary parts

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
now one can ask whether

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
in general the complex exponential

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
with the magnitude about the equal to one is periodically not periodic

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and a clue to that can be inferred

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
by examining this expression

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
in particular in the discrete-time case with the magnitude about equal to 1

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
we have pure sinusoids in the real

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
part in an imaginary part

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and in fact in a continuous-time case with are equal to 0

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
we have sinusoids in the real party imaginary part

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
in a continuous-time case we have a pure complex exponential

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
in fact so that so the terms are exponentially growing your DK

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
back those exponentials are always periodic because

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the course the real and imaginary sinusoidal Cup on its superior

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
in the discrete-time case we know that the sinusoids may or may not be periodic

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
depending on the bad you love Omega 0 and so in fact

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
in the discrete-time case the exponential

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
eat to the J Omega 0n

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that i've indicated here may or may not be periodic

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
depending on what the value Omega zeros

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
okay now to summarize

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
in this lecture I introduced and discussed

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
a number of important basic signals

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
in particular sinusoids an real

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and complex exponentials one of the important outcomes

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
the discussion emphasize further in the text is that

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
there are some very important similarities between them

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
but there are also some very important differences

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and these differences will surface when we exploit

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
sinusoids and complex exponentials

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
as basic building blocks for more general continuous-time

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in discrete-time signals in the next lecture

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
what I'll discuss are some other very important building blocks

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
namely what are referred to as

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
step signals an impulse signals and

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
does together with the sinusoidal

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
signals and exponentials as we've talked about today

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
will really form the cornerstone

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
for essentially all love the signal and system analysis

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
there will be dealing with for the remainder the course thank you
