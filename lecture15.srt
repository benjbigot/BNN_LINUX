15
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,850 
in the last lecture we begin

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,730 
the discussion love modulation and in
particular what we focused on

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,350 
was the continuous-time case and in
talking about continuous-time modulation

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,080 
we covered a number of topics we talked
about

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,119 
the properties and analysis love

20
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,660 
modulation when we had a complex
exponential

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,940 
carrier signal we talked about the
properties and analysis in the case of a

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,490 
sinusoidal carrier

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,520 
and in that context and related to

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,100 
the application associated with
communications

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,149 
we talked about synchronous modulation

26
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,410 
a synchronous modulation and

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,910 
also the notion love single sideband

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,920 
modulation in

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,520 
the lecture today there are to issues
that I'd like to address broad topics

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,160 
one is Acer parallel discussion

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,560 
particularly is associated with complex
exponential sinusoidal modulation

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,910 
for discrete-time signals and

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,060 
the second is the introduction and
analysis

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,520 
love a another kind of carriers
specifically a post kind of carrier

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,540 
in continuous time leading to the
notions of pulse amplitude modulation

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,310 
and eventually a very powerful theramin
result called the sampling there

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,610 
well let me begin the lecture though
focusing on

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,760 
the discrete-time modulation to
essentially

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,489 
draw your attention to the fact dead the
analysis and discrete-time

40
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,230 
very much parallels the analysis in
continuous-time

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,450 
well let's consider in the discrete-time

42
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,069 
case just as we had in continuous-time a

43
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,540 
signal modulating a carrier signal

44
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,050 
and the resulting modulated signal

45
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,450 
is why event and it was

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,530 
in continuous-time the modulation
property

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,390 
Associated with the four EA transform
dead

48
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,580 
provided the basis for the analysis and
exactly the same thing is true in a

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,330 
discrete-time

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,880 
case in particular what we have in
discrete-time

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,060 
is the modulation property as it relates
to the Fourier transform

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,350 
which tells us that the four EA
transform of the modulated signal

53
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,120 
is the convolution all the

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,730 
for a transformer the carrier and the 48
transform or

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,460 
the modulating signal and the only real
difference in issue here

56
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,480 
is that in the discrete-time case

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480 
what we're talking about is a periodic

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,270 
convolution because the specter of
course a periodic

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,760 
whereas in a continuous-time case it was
an a periodic convolution so let's

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,440 
parallel the discussion and in
particular what will focus on

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,840 
is first a complex exponential

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,319 
carrier and second a

63
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,430 
sinusoidal carrier and we'll see how
this parallels our discussion in

64
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,760 
continuous-time

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,199 
and will make fairly brief reference as
we introduce

66
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,019 
the post carrier for continuous-time
will bring make very brief reference to

67
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,009 
the post carrier for discrete-time

68
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,699 
indicating that again the analysis and
discrete-time and continuous-time

69
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,419 
is very parallel soul let's first
consider

70
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,500 
complex exponential and sinus all
carriers

71
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,880 
for the discrete-time case emphasizing

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,729 
the very strong parallel and similarity
between

73
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,780 
discrete-time and continuous-time well

74
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,750 
we have once again the modulation
property

75
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,319 
and the modulation property tells us
that the spectrum

76
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,270 
all the modulated signal is the periodic

77
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,080 
convolution love the two spectra

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,389 
and let's consider for example

79
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,480 
an input for modulating spectrum as i've
indicated here

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,900 
and since we what to consider first the
fall

81
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,320 
a complex exponential carrier

82
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,669 
will consider the case of CNN

83
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,669 
equal to each to the J Omega subsea

84
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,350 
n and let me stress by the way as

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,150 
I did in the continuous-time case

86
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,380 
dead out 10 to suppress the phase angle
which of course can be associated with

87
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,600 
the carrier also

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,160 
alright so we have then the spectrum

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,199 
%uh the modulating signal the spektr the
carrier signal

90
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840 
if this is the carrier then its spectrum
is an impulse train

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,889 
and then imposed strain I've indicated

92
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,610 
here and let me stress also that in

93
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,400 
the discrete-time case of course the
spectra

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,510 
and all of the spektr involved are
periodic with period of two pi

95
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,020 
so this then is the spectrum of the
carrier signal

96
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,680 
this is the spectrum the input signal
the periodic convolution if these two

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,570 
is the spektr on the modulated signal
and the result

98
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,160 
is then this spectrum shifted

99
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,930 
to center frequency which is the carrier
frequency

100
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,100 
Omega subsea so

101
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,270 
the result love modulation with a
complex exponential

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,889 
is a straightforward shifted the
spectrum

103
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,580 
to a carrot to so that what occurred
around

104
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,919 
zero frequency now occurs around the
frequency Omega subsea

105
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,430 
now in the continuous-time k sweetie
modulated

106
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,979 
with the case when we had a complex
exponential carrier weedy modulated

107
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,979 
by essentially just shifting the
spectrum back

108
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,160 
and he in fact in the discrete-time case
were able to do exactly the same thing

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,990 
so if we work to replace

110
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,600 
see a van which is huge and make a
subsidy and

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,050 
by see a very cozy the minus J Omega

112
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,419 
CN the resulting spectrum

113
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,660 
would be an impulse train

114
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,030 
as i indicate here and

115
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,979 
the result all multiply why I have an

116
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,050 
by that new carrier

117
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,100 
in the frequency domain is a convolution
if these two

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,290 
and its relatively straightforward to
verify that

119
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,580 
if you can follow these for the periodic
convolution

120
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,490 
then that will get us back to the
original spectrum that we started with

121
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,690 
so what's happened in the discrete-time
case for the complex exponential

122
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,400 
is exactly the same as in
continuous-time

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,460 
namely we might too late that
corresponds to shifting the spectrum

124
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,870 
weedy modulate by multiplying by the
complex conjugate

125
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,330 
the original modulating care the
original carrier

126
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,259 
and that shifts the spectrum back to
where it was originally

127
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,919 
okay now let's consider the case of a
sinusoidal carrier in discrete-time

128
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,090 
and again things very much parallel

129
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,150 
what we saw in continuous-time

130
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,360 
and again as we look at the specter

131
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,509 
I will choose a phase angle 0

132
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:37,469 
mainly for notational an analytical
convenience

133
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,870 
so in this case now rather than

134
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,750 
a carrier signal which is a single
complex exponential

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,720 
it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the
sinus or carrier is the summer too

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,329 
complex exponentials

137
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,860 
and so if we consider a modulating
spectrum that is the specter affects a

138
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,269 
van

139
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:04,120 
as something are the type that I
indicate here

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,690 
and the spectrum of the carrier

141
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,370 
now since the carrier is sign a soil
rather than

142
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,089 
a complex exponential consists of two
impulses

143
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,199 
wanted pasta makers see and one at minus
Omega subsea

144
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:24,369 
convolved ing this spectrum with this
spectrum

145
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,910 
gives us a replication affective Omega

146
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,470 
around plus and minus Omega subsea

147
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,769 
and incidently with an ample to change a
hair

148
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,179 
so again things have

149
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,589 
worked as they did in continuous-time

150
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,629 
in continuous time or in discrete-time

151
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,839 
modulating with a sinusoidal carrier

152
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,860 
with then correspond to a replication of
the spectrum

153
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,290 
around plus the carrier frequency and
replication the spectrum

154
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,769 
around minus the carrier frequency in
both cases

155
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,619 
as long as the carrier frequency is
large enough compared with the band with

156
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,860 
the signal

157
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,679 
so that those two replications don't
overlap

158
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,740 
then its reasonable to suppose

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,309 
that we should be able to recover the
original signal

160
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:23,079 
well in fact to d modulate

161
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,839 
in the discrete-time case we would again

162
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,059 
follow very much the strategy that we
did in continuous-time

163
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,550 
in particular let's consider the
modulating

164
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,779 
by taking the modulated signal

165
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,970 
and again putting it through modulator
again

166
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,689 
with a carrier which is co-signed Omega
CN

167
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,459 
if we do that we have a the modulator

168
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:54,470 
or what will turn out to be part of the
modulator as i indicate here

169
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,089 
the spectrum or the import signal

170
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,059 
is as I had just developed a replication

171
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:06,869 
up the original spectrum around plus and
minus Omega subsea

172
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,389 
with an amplitude of the hair when this

173
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,470 
is again convolved with the spectrum

174
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,689 
love the carrier then

175
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:21,029 
we get a replication of the original
spectrum

176
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,649 
first around zero frequency as i
indicate here

177
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,610 
and then around twice the carrier
frequency

178
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,019 
and minus twice the carrier frequency

179
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,110 
and as long as the carrier frequency

180
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,110 
is large enough compared with the

181
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,489 
with of the original signal day and as
you can see

182
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:48,100 
by extracting this part of the spectrum

183
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,239 
with the low-pass filter we can in
principle

184
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,809 
recover the spectrum associated with the
original signal

185
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,800 
and again justice in continuous-time
because this amplitude is a half

186
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,709 
we would want to choose for scaling
purposes

187
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,569 
a low-pass filter ample to which is

188
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,639 
to to compensate for this factor in the
hair

189
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,850 
so once again things work at basically

190
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,379 
the same way as they had in
continuous-time

191
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,800 
we have sinusoidal modulation

192
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,019 
which consists love using a sinusoidal
carrier

193
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,509 
and we have the the modulator

194
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,199 
which consists of taking the modulated
signal

195
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,269 
multiplying by the carrier and then

196
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,040 
processing Matt with a low-pass filter

197
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,170 
to extract the portion of the spectrum

198
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:53,170 
which is around zero frequency as i
indicate in the spectra below

199
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,439 
and the result then with this low pass
filter having a gain of two

200
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:02,879 
is that we've recovered the original
spectrum

201
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,999 
exit Omega which is the spectrum

202
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,149 
that we started now

203
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,129 
several other things to stress this is a
fairly quick

204
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:18,489 
to we're through sinusoidal modulation
for discrete-time

205
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:22,189 
in there are very similar issues that
arise in

206
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:26,709 
the discrete-time case in terms of love
having faced synchronization

207
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,110 
and frequency synchronization between
the modulator and demodulator

208
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,999 
and we had discussed that in a fair
amount of detail for the continuous-time

209
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:39,429 
case in some sense in practical terms

210
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:43,730 
that becomes much more than issue in
continuous-time

211
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,019 
than it does in discrete-time in part
because

212
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,619 
synchronization between a modulator and
demodulator

213
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:56,889 
is often much harder in a
continuous-time

214
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:00,589 
system which is essentially an analog
system

215
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,029 
as compared with a digital system
another

216
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,079 
very important reason and it's important
to stress this at the outset

217
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,589 
is that whereas the theory involving

218
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,720 
the use of complex exponentials
sinusoidal modulation

219
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,269 
parallels very strongly in the
continuous-time

220
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,189 
and the discrete-time case in practical
terms

221
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:26,749 
it has much more significance in
continuous-time

222
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:30,009 
than it does in discrete-time that is
the notion

223
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:35,329 
love sinusoidal modulation in the
context of communication systems

224
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,639 
is extremely important for
continuous-time systems

225
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,709 
and less so in discrete-time systems

226
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,339 
now kinda as a preview of a point to be
raise later on

227
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,639 
I should modify that slightly with the
statement

228
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,309 
that one very important plays in which

229
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:59,329 
sinusoidal modulation in a discrete-time
context the rises

230
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:06,329 
is in a class of systems called trance
multiplexers or trans modulation systems

231
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:09,949 
and this surface is basically because

232
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,589 
so many communication systems are now

233
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,489 
becoming digital and specifically
discrete-time although the actual

234
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,049 
transmission is continuous time

235
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,569 
the signal processing manipulation
switching

236
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:27,319 
is discrete-time it so in fact it turns
out

237
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,809 
to be very important and useful to take

238
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:34,489 
a discrete-time representation I love

239
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:37,889 
the analog signals a continuous-time
signals

240
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,839 
and in a discrete-time or digital
representation

241
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,149 
convert them from one modulation scheme

242
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,920 
41 multiplexing scheme to another and

243
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,350 
although I said a lot there that

244
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,559 
really requires much more detail to

245
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,269 
to develop in any in any sense at all

246
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,410 
you should come to get the notion that
that discrete-time

247
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,749 
modulation systems become very important

248
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:13,089 
in part because or implementation Elis
use

249
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,350 
okay now there is another application

250
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,949 
dead we have discussed for both
continuous time actually previously for

251
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:22,579 
discrete-time

252
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,629 
amplitude modulation with sinusoidal or
complex exponential carriers

253
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:33,169 
and let me just remind you that because
in fact it becomes a very important one

254
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,999 
in the case love discrete-time systems

255
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,119 
and that is the notion love using

256
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:44,069 
modulation together with fixed filtering

257
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,290 
to implement a filter which is

258
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,529 
which either has a variable cut off or

259
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,600 
converts let's say a low-pass filter to
a high pass filter

260
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,209 
we originally talked about this when we
introduce the modulation property

261
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,329 
in the context of converting a low-pass
filter

262
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:07,240 
to a high pass filter and the notion was

263
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,089 
that if we modulate the signal

264
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,959 
with a carrier which is -1 to the end
and that's just simply complex

265
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,010 
exponential

266
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,549 
or sinusoidal carrier with a carrier
frequency of pie

267
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:28,020 
than that in effect interchanges the low
frequencies in the high frequencies

268
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,840 
and if and after modulation

269
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,120 
that is processed with a low pass filter

270
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,780 
and then the result is d modulated

271
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,740 
using exactly the same carrier namely a
carrier which is

272
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,860 
-1 to the end

273
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,750 
then the effective that is equivalent

274
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,140 
to high-pass filtering on the original
signal

275
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,710 
and a generalization a bad would involve
instead a

276
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,000 
this specific choice if -1 to the end

277
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,070 
would involve a choice in general or the
e to the J Omega sed CNN

278
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,740 
that is a more general carrier frequency
and

279
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,990 
d modulator which is either the minus J

280
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,980 
Omega subsea and and as i've represented
here

281
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,750 
and as we had talked about it when we
talked about the modulation property for

282
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,400 
discrete-time signals

283
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,950 
we had specifically chosen the
conversion of a low pass to a high pass

284
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,100 
filter

285
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,110 
well let me continue the review of that

286
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,850 
just by reminding you of the details of
what happens with the spectra

287
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,880 
and specifically the notion

288
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,010 
if we take this particular case omega-6
equal

289
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,960 
to pie or covertly a carrier signal
which is -1 to the end

290
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,300 
then if we have the original spectra

291
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,500 
and the specter all

292
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,480 
specter of the carrier signal the
spectrum of the carrier signal

293
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,540 
convolved with this spectrum

294
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,630 
will then in effect shift this by

295
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,750 
pie and so after

296
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,940 
modulating the result that we have is

297
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,940 
shifted that spectrum so that what
happened at low frequencies now happens

298
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,730 
at high frequencies namely around pie

299
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,670 
and what happens at what happened at
high frequencies now happens

300
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,400 
at low frequencies well if thats process
now

301
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,570 
with a low pass filter and this dashed
line indicates the low-pass filter

302
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,790 
then the result that we get is shown
here

303
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,630 
where we've extracted the low-frequency
portion of the modulated signal

304
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,940 
and now when we modulate or D modulate
back

305
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,630 
then this spectrum is shifted back to
where it belongs

306
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,000 
namely its shifted back to be centered
around

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,730 
minus pie and around plus Park

308
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,990 
so if we just compare this spectrum

309
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,390 
with the original spectrum at the top

310
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,420 
what we can see is that in effect what
we've done

311
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,630 
is to extract a portion of the spectrum

312
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,390 
acquittal and the processing with a high
pass filter

313
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,700 
and again this is very similar to what
we did in continuous-time

314
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,620 
and all of the kinda analytical
processes and

315
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,030 
and convolutions involved are very much
the same

316
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,740 
really the biggest difference between
continuous-time and discrete-time

317
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,960 
has to do not so much with the details
of the analysis but

318
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,110 
perhaps has more to do with issues

319
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:59,110 
love are practical applications

320
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,470 
okay well so what we've done

321
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,140 
so far for continuous-time and
discrete-time

322
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,270 
is to talk about modulation amplitude
modulation

323
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,540 
with complex exponential and sinus or
carriers

324
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,970 
we saw that the analysis is very similar
although

325
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,290 
applications are slightly different and
now what I'd like to turn to

326
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,390 
is a different choice love

327
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,390 
carrier signal and the carrier signal in
this particular case

328
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,720 
is a post rain rather than

329
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,580 
a sinusoidal signal now

330
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,870 
the idea is the following

331
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,990 
in general of course the modulator

332
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,420 
it consists all multiplying x50

333
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,240 
by whatever the carrier signal is and

334
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,460 
previously we've talked about a carrier
signal which is sinusoidal

335
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,510 
the carrier signal that we want to
consider now

336
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,830 
is a carrier signal which in fact is

337
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,160 
a pulse train and so in fact

338
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,240 
what we want to do is multiply the input
signal

339
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,020 
by a Paul strain and in effect then

340
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,230 
the modulated signal consists

341
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,370 
of the original signal simply with time
slices pulled out a bit as i've

342
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,100 
indicated in the bottom Kurt

343
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,150 
so what we have now

344
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,580 
is a modulated signal

345
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,450 
that is a chopped or sliced version

346
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,390 
love the original waveform and

347
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,330 
think that is what's referred to as
pulse amplitude modulation

348
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,940 
now it seems like it's kinda crazy idea
any ideas

349
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,080 
search opt-out slices away form and

350
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,690 
the hope that you can kinda put things
back together again

351
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,220 
and the amazing thing about it is we'll
see is that in fact

352
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,190 
under fairly broad general and
applicability

353
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,650 
conditions you really can put the way
for back together again

354
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,710 
if you just have these times places

355
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,050 
not only that but that basic notion

356
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,950 
as we'll see is independent in fact

357
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,940 
up with the with the those time slices
or effect the with can go to zero

358
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,480 
and in fact we're going to make the with
go to zero and really only dependent

359
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,700 
on what the frequency love the polls
trainers

360
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,960 
so let's explore that in some detail

361
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,620 
and what we want to look at is the
analysis but let me

362
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,260 
let me first just comment very briefly
there

363
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,420 
all the analysis we go through as has
been true in the case a sinusoidal

364
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,150 
modulation all the analysis that we go
through

365
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,600 
holes just as well with

366
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,390 
especially minor analytical
modifications to

367
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,660 
discrete-time pulse amplitude modulation
as it does to

368
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,720 
continuous-time pulse amplitude
modulation

369
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,860 
and so will really only go through this

370
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,830 
in terms of tracking the way for
inspector for the continuous-time

371
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,960 
case but bear in mind that the results
are basically similar

372
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,040 
for discrete-time okay well

373
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,090 
let's see how we get the basic result

374
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,120 
that we want to get

375
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,160 
what we have is a

376
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,880 
modulating signal which is a pulse train
basically a square wave

377
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,710 
and as we've seen in previous lectures
the spectra

378
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,430 
or Fourier transform associated with
that is an impulse train

379
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,760 
and the envelope that impulse train

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440 
is over for over sin x over X function

381
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,950 
the four th transform is impulses and
the spacing of the impulses

382
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,780 
is Associated with the fundamental
frequency

383
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,350 
all the Paul strain and thats Omega
Sappi so make it appears to pride

384
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,660 
divided by the period

385
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,330 
the pulse train and at the

386
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,960 
amplitude and shape but this envelope is
dictated

387
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,980 
by that parameter Delta

388
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,640 
which has to do with how wide the pulses
are

389
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,110 
okay so we have a time function

390
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,520 
it's multiplied by this post rain now
we're talking continuous-time

391
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,620 
so in the frequency domain

392
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,140 
we have the Fourier transform the time
function convolved with

393
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,190 
this Fourier transform for the pulse
train and let's see what that looks like

394
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,550 
if we were to consider let's say

395
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,590 
a Fourier transform which I A kinda
chosen is more or less a general one

396
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,440 
then in fact when we can follow this

397
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,680 
with this simple strain what we end up
with

398
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,630 
is a replication all

399
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,870 
this spectrum at

400
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,400 
the places in the frequency domain

401
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,270 
where the individual impulses occurred

402
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,770 
so we can see that this spectrum is
replicated at each's

403
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,520 
these locations and as long as

404
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,540 
the frequency

405
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,600 
above the post-training is large enough
compared

406
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,270 
with a maximum frequency in the

407
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:44,900 
original single X if T so that there is
no overlap between these triangles

408
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,910 
then what you can see in fact somewhat
amazingly

409
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,420 
is dead simply by low-pass filtering the
result

410
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,080 
we can get back except for an amplitude
factor

411
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,210 
we can give get back to the original
signal

412
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,520 
now it's amazing it really is amazing

413
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,860 
dead all that this depends on

414
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,280 
is the original signal being banned
limited

415
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,190 
and the frequency the post-training be
high enough

416
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,260 
so that when you replicate the spectrum
in the frequency domain

417
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,050 
is no overlap between these individual
replications and will

418
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,370 
have a dress that a little more in a few
minutes

419
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,580 
but let me first the ball point out that

420
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,360 
this has a whole variety a very
important implications

421
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,630 
one is in the context of communications

422
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,880 
it leads to another very important

423
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,600 
multiplexing scheme for communications
we talked last time about

424
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,940 
frequency division multiplexing where
individual signals were put into

425
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,000 
individual frequency slots

426
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,240 
by choosing different carrier
frequencies for sinusoidal modulated

427
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,440 
signal

428
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,040 
what this suggests is that what we can
do

429
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,520 
is put the

430
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,500 
sons put different signals into

431
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,800 
non-overlapping time slots

432
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,950 
and in fact be able to recover the
original signals back again

433
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,030 
so in particular suppose that

434
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,000 
I had a signal which I modulated with a
pulse train

435
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,230 
and I i chose another signal modulated
with another poll strain

436
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,480 
where the time slot was different and I
continue this process

437
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,070 
and after the after i'd done this with
some number of channels

438
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,070 
simply and it all those together

439
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,190 
as i indicate here then as long as I
knew what time slots to associate with

440
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,240 
what signal

441
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,780 
I could get the original a

442
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,920 
modulated signals back again

443
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,940 
and then as long as the frequency 0

444
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,730 
the impulse train was such that

445
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,870 
I was able to do this reconstruction

446
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,990 
by simply low-pass filtering then

447
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,380 
I would be able to be my Julie so it's a
very different very important modulation

448
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,030 
scheme call time division

449
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,130 
multiplexing in contrast to frequency
division multiplexing as we talked about

450
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,730 
last time

451
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,720 
I made reference earlier the concept of
Trance multiplexing and in fact

452
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,460 
what happens in many communication
systems

453
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,420 
is dead the signals are represented in
fact

454
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,350 
in discrete-time the analog continues
time signals are represented in

455
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,470 
discrete-time

456
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,500 
and very often the conversion from

457
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,530 
frequency division multiplexing to time
division multiplexing and back

458
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,130 
is done in fact in the discrete-time to
me

459
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,660 
okay so what we have then

460
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,770 
is the notion

461
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,809 
dead we can

462
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:06,040 
multiply a time function

463
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,950 
by a poll strain as i indicated here

464
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,530 
and from the output I can

465
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,559 
if the frequency this post rain is high
enough in relation to this band with

466
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,860 
from the output which consists of both

467
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,840 
time slices from those times places

468
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,290 
I can recover the original signal

469
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,730 
stressing again the reason it relates

470
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,780 
to the spectra and

471
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,210 
the reason is dead the original spectra

472
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,280 
is simply replicated at

473
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,700 
multiples all the fundamental frequency

474
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,920 
upholstery

475
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,010 
now is a very important thing to observe
here

476
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,890 
which is dead the ability to do the
reconstruction

477
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,120 
is associated with the notion of whether
we can extract that

478
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,480 
kinda central triangle light happened
choose a triangular shape but

479
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,140 
obviously I could be talking about any
shape as long as it's been limited

480
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,240 
the ability to extract at and notice

481
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,110 
that in this modulated output spectrum

482
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,290 
the ability to recover this is totally
independent

483
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,790 
all what the value of Delta is in other
words

484
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,960 
if we look back at

485
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,360 
the modulator then

486
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,990 
in fact we can make Delta

487
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,370 
the with these pulses arbitrarily small

488
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,510 
and in theory that doesn't affect

489
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,190 
our ability to do the reconstruction now
in practical terms it might

490
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,580 
looking back once more at the specter of
the output

491
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,580 
noticed that this sample to is
proportional to Delta

492
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,000 
and what that suggests is that as we
make

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,070 
Delta smaller and smaller which we

494
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,510 
might in fact want to do if you want to
time division multiplexed last two

495
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,230 
channels

496
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,130 
in principle in theory you could make it
an infinite number channels just by

497
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,160 
making an infinitesimally small

498
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,140 
the smaller it is in some sense the less
energy there is and again

499
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,760 
in practical terms this one of those
things if you push down here pops up

500
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,620 
there

501
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,490 
namely you eventually run into issues
such as noise problems

502
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,800 
so more more typically what's done is

503
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,400 
to in fact eliminate the scale factor a
delta

504
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,580 
and the way that that's done is very
simply

505
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,250 
it's done by choosing

506
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,740 
the with I love the pulses

507
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,559 
and the height %uh the pulses in such a
way

508
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,490 
dead the area is constant even as

509
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,600 
we make Delta get arbitrarily small so

510
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,690 
and we can just modify our argument

511
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,890 
so that what we're referring to is a
modulating post rain

512
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,100 
which is a pulse train with positive
with Delta

513
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,040 
and height one over Delta in that case

514
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,429 
as Delta gets arbitrarily small

515
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,380 
then in fact what these rectangles
become

516
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,710 
are impulses in which case what we're
talking about

517
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,160 
is a carrier signal

518
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,290 
which in fact is an impulse train

519
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,780 
and the resulting modulated signal

520
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,730 
is and imposed strain for which the
amplitudes

521
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,640 
of the impulses are proportional to

522
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,120 
the original input waveform at

523
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,040 
the times at which these impulses occur

524
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,520 
okay well let's look at the analysis a
bat

525
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,929 
and so now what we're talking about

526
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:10,220 
is a spectrum

527
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,030 
dead up

528
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,540 
consists all the result

529
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,990 
love the spectrum we talked about before
the sin x over X envelope except

530
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,270 
that now is Delta goes to zero that
becomes

531
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,990 
flat in other words the modulating
signal is an impulse train

532
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,429 
and so as we look at the spectrum

533
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,540 
the modulating signal that is then

534
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,919 
and impose train in the frequency domain
the high

535
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,629 
is proportional to the frequency

536
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:49,309 
up the impulse train and Omega the best
now denotes

537
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:53,139 
the frequency the impulse train and

538
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,410 
the resulting output the modulator

539
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,539 
has a spectrum which is

540
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,059 
this original spectrum again replicated
around

541
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:09,630 
each love these impulses in other words
replicated in multiples

542
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,480 
or the sampling frequency now

543
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,739 
this is very much identical to the more
general case we have

544
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,819 
this replication the spectra

545
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,499 
and as long as

546
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,759 
this sample the the frequency of the
impulse train is

547
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:33,640 
large enough compared with the band with
the signal

548
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,950 
so that these triangles don't overlap

549
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,650 
I can extract this

550
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,730 
portion of the spectrum by low-pass
filtering

551
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,230 
which in fact with then give us back

552
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,430 
the original signal now

553
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,190 
if instead this frequency Omega sed am

554
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,339 
is greater than Omega best minus Omega
sed am

555
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:02,130 
we would have a spectrum that looked

556
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,210 
something more like this and what's
happened

557
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,239 
in this case is that because

558
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,410 
we have an overlap here we've destroyed
the ability

559
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,430 
to recover the original signal from the
impulse train

560
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,039 
and that would be true also in general
in a more general case

561
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,279 
love pulse amplitude modulation with

562
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:26,789 
pulses that up 90 with

563
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:31,220 
this effect by the way is one that will
be

564
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,809 
exploring in considerably more detail in
the next lecture and

565
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,489 
it's a phenomenon or distortion referred
to as a leasing which

566
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,579 
in fact is important and interesting
topic but

567
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:46,880 
going back to the case in which we've
chosen the frequency of the upholstery

568
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,150 
in high enough

569
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,900 
then we would recover the original
signal

570
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900 
by processing it through

571
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,039 
a low-pass filter

572
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,839 
and in in that case

573
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,259 
what this says is dead if we have a
signal

574
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:12,349 
and we modulated with an impulse train

575
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:17,769 
if we then process that impulse train
through an ideal ok pass filter

576
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,289 
given the right conditions on Sat on the
frequency the impulse train and the band

577
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:23,470 
with the signal

578
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,029 
we can recover the original signal back
again

579
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:31,329 
now let me stress just going back to

580
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,480 
the picture in which we have done this
modulation

581
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,999 
that this process where the modulation

582
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:42,819 
where the carrier signal involves an
impulse train is

583
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:46,299 
often referred to as sampling and

584
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,999 
what that mean specifically is dead

585
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:55,170 
if we notice this resulting in polls
train

586
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,450 
is in fact a sequence

587
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,900 
all samples all

588
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,239 
the original continuous-time signal in
other words

589
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,950 
what we've done in effect is taken
instantaneous samples at this way form

590
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,980 
and the implication is that if we do
that

591
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,230 
at a rapid and afraid in relation

592
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,180 
to the band with the signal then

593
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,259 
we can in fact recover the original
signal back again

594
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,579 
and finally to remind you

595
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:31,799 
I'll the argument once more

596
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,989 
we have an original signal

597
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:40,809 
and we have its spectrum when we've
sampled it and this is now the sampled

598
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:44,940 
signal it's an impulse train whose
instantaneous values

599
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,829 
are samples at the original waveform the
spectrum a bad

600
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:53,829 
is the original one replicated

601
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,170 
and when that is processed through a

602
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,930 
low-pass filter to extract this part of
the spectrum

603
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,559 
then after the low-pass filter we can

604
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:11,349 
recover the original signal back again

605
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,730 
okay well in fact me although

606
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,799 
a if you kinda follow through

607
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,440 
the specter and the waveforms this all
seems fairly

608
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,700 
straightforward and perhaps

609
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,289 
or perhaps not obvious

610
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:32,079 
it's really worth reflecting on how
amazing

611
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,839 
the result really is what it says we
begin this discussion

612
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,980 
by talking about modulation and in fact
modulation and sinusoidal modulation is

613
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,420 
important in its own right

614
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,880 
we ended the discussion by talking

615
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,890 
about first pulse amplitude modulation

616
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,309 
and then showing how under the right set
of conditions

617
00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:01,319 
you can in fact take away form and

618
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:05,529 
sample it with a set of instantaneous
samples

619
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:08,630 
and that said instantaneous samples in
fact

620
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,390 
are sufficient totally represent and
reconstruct the signal

621
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,039 
what in fact the formal statement that
is

622
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:22,049 
is referred to as the sampling theorem

623
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,180 
very powerful their own that says

624
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,279 
if were given equally spaced samples
over time function

625
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:35,660 
and if that time function is band
limited

626
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,460 
and if the band with

627
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,249 
or is or if this if this sampling
frequency is

628
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:48,119 
chosen in the right way in relation

629
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,249 
to the

630
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:55,319 
band with then in fact

631
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,359 
the original time function is

632
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:05,150 
uniquely recoverable with a low-pass
filter

633
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,329 
now the sampling theorem is kinda

634
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:12,720 
I would say a watershed a cornerstone

635
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,999 
love a lot of the discussion we've been
having

636
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:20,539 
for a whole variety of reasons if first
of all crops out almost as kind as

637
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,670 
straightforward obvious statement but
more importantly

638
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,190 
what it says is dead

639
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,410 
if I have a continuous-time signal which
satisfies the right-center conditions

640
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,960 
I can represent it by what it does

641
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,319 
at sampling instance or acquittal only
at discrete

642
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,920 
is this a time

643
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,989 
now what that leads to

644
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:51,160 
is a whole host of things wanna which

645
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,499 
is the statement that says if we have a
continuous-time signal

646
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:58,640 
I could in fact represented

647
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,249 
as a discrete-time signal and I could
even think

648
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:06,140 
love processing a continuous-time signal

649
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,489 
using discrete time concepts

650
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:12,819 
and when I'm all done converting back
through

651
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:15,789 
the power the sampling theorem
converting back to a continuous-time

652
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:16,880 
sick

653
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,220 
so the sampling theorem provides this

654
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,559 
with a very major important bridge
between

655
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,920 
continuous-time and discrete-time
implementations and ideas

656
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,119 
in the next several lectures we will be
exploring so this in considerable detail

657
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,420 
first the focus in more next time

658
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,720 
on some with the specific issues and
distortions associated with sampling and

659
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,009 
following that

660
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:48,470 
a discussion are what is referred to as

661
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,400 
discrete-time processing of
continuous-time signals

662
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,660 
thank you
