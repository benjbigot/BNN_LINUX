the over the last series of lectures

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,870 
in discussing filtering modulation
sampling we've seen how powerful

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,030 
and useful the four EA transform is
beginning

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,390 
with this lecture and over the next
several lectures I'd

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,409 
like to develop and exploit a
generalization

18
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:19,610 
other 48 transform which will not only
lead to some important new insights

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,710 
about signals and systems

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,420 
but also will remove some of the
restrictions

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,830 
that we've had with the Fourier
transform the generalization

22
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,960 
dead we'll be talking about in the
continuous-time cases referred to

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,280 
as the apostrophe its form and in the
discrete-time cases referred to as the z

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,170 
transform

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,710 
but I'd like to do in today's lecture is
begin on the continuous-time

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,759 
case namely a discussion at the La Paz
transform

27
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,420 
continued at it to the next lecture and
following that

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,489 
develop the z transform for
discrete-time

29
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:02,110 
and also as we go along exploit

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,569 
the two notions together now

31
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,009 
to introduce the notion of the law
applies transform

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:15,910 
let me remind you again all what led us
into the Fourier transform we

33
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,080 
develop the 48 transform by

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,770 
considering the idea love representing

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,319 
signals as linear combinations a basic
signals

36
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,360 
and in the Fourier transform in the

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,319 
continuous-time case the basic signals

38
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,430 
that we picked in the representation
were complex exponentials

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,650 
and in what we refer to as

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,900 
the synthesis equation the synthesis
equation corresponded

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,830 
to in effect a dick opposition as a
linear combination

42
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,340 
decomposition affects ft as a linear
combination of complex exponentials

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,450 
and of course associated with this was

44
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,760 
the corresponding analysis equation dead

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,439 
in effect gave us the amplitudes
associated with the complex exponentials

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,560 
now why did we pick complex exponentials

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,629 
well recall that the reason was

48
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,739 
that complex exponentials are I can
functions of linear time-invariant

49
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:19,999 
systems

50
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,139 
and that was very convenient
specifically

51
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,590 
if we have a linear time-invariant
system

52
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,859 
with an impulse response 850 well we had
shown

53
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,680 
is that that class a systems has the
property

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,939 
that if we put in a complex exponential
we get out

55
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,779 
a complex exponential at the same
frequency

56
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,959 
and with the change in amplitude and
this change in amplitude

57
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,819 
in fact corresponded as we showed as the
discussion went along

58
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,969 
to 248 transform all

59
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,139 
the system impulse response so

60
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,819 
the notion love decomposing signals

61
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,969 
into complex exponentials was very
intimately connected in the Fourier

62
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,419 
transforms very intimately connected

63
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,100 
with the eigenfunction property a
complex exponentials for linear

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,620 
time-invariant systems

65
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,639 
well complex exponentials have that type
are not

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,110 
the only I can functions for linear
time-invariant systems

67
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,930 
in fact what you've seen previously

68
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,020 
is that if we took a more general
exponential

69
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,430 
you to the st. where s

70
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,230 
is a more general complex number not
just J Omega

71
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,450 
but in fact Sigma plus J Omega for any
bad you have s

72
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,380 
a comp the complex exponential is an
eigenfunction

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,080 
and we can justify that simply by
substitution into the convolution

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,020 
integral

75
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,540 
in other words the response to this
complex exponential

76
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,849 
is the convolution up the impulse
response

77
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,180 
with the exhortation an notice

78
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,660 
there we can break this term into a
product

79
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,960 
eat to the st. you need to the minus s

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,120 
now and BU the st. term

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,280 
become outside the integration

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,139 
and consequently just carrying through
that algebra

83
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,539 
would reduce this integral

84
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,160 
to an integral with

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,750 
in the st. fact there outside so just
simply carrying through the algebra

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,960 
what we would conclude is that a complex
exponential

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,990 
with any complex number ass which
generate as an output

88
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,270 
a complex exponential have the same form

89
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,470 
multiplied by whatever this integral is

90
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,210 
and this integral of course will depend
on what the value a veces

91
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,210 
but that's all that it will depend on or
said another way

92
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,860 
what this all can be denoted as

93
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,120 
is some function Hibs that

94
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,610 
depends on the value of s so finally

95
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,889 
then you the st. as an exhortation

96
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,819 
to linear time-invariant system
generates a response

97
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,590 
which is a complex constant depending on
S

98
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,819 
multiplying the same

99
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,340 
function that excited the system

100
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,620 
so what we have been is

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,120 
the I can function property more
generally in terms of

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,280 
a more general complex exponential

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,659 
where the complex factor is given by
this integral

104
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,949 
well in fact with that integral
corresponds to

105
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,580 
is what we will the fine

106
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,840 
as the apostrophe its form of the
impulse response

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,970 
and in fact we can apply this
transformation

108
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,639 
to a more general time function that may
or may not be

109
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,340 
the impulse response this ove a linear
time-invariant system

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,520 
and so in general it is this
transformation

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,580 
on a time function which is

112
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,060 
the a-plus transform that time function

113
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,220 
and it's a functional bests so

114
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,020 
the definition up the applause transform

115
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,659 
is that the applause transform overtime
function X 50

116
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,590 
is the result love this transformation

117
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,050 
on exit to the it's the noted as
excessive ass

118
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,210 
and as a shorthand notation as we had
with the four EA transform

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,599 
then we have in the time domain the time
function except the

120
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,030 
and in the apostrophe its form domain
the

121
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,099 
function XFS and these then

122
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,550 
represent a transformed pair

123
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,860 
now let me remind you that

124
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,009 
that the the development of that mapping

125
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,050 
is exactly the process that we went
through initially in developing

126
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,240 
a mapping that ended up giving the
giving us the Fourier transform

127
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,719 
essentially what we've done is just
broaden your horizon

128
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:24,139 
some white or our notation some white

129
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,759 
and rather than pushing just the complex
exponential through the system

130
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,789 
we've pushed a more general time
function either the st.

131
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:39,120 
where ass is a complex number with both
a real part in an imaginary part

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,789 
well the discussion we going through so
far course is

133
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,310 
very closely related to when what we
went through

134
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,590 
for the Fourier transform the mapping
and we've ended up with

135
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,120 
is called the applause transform and as
you can well imagine and perhaps

136
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,340 
may have recognized already there's a
very close connection

137
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,530 
between the applause transform and the
Fourier transform

138
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,220 
well to see wanted the connections well
we can observe

139
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,410 
is that if we look at the Fourier
transform expression

140
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,490 
and if we look at the applause transform
expression

141
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,420 
where ass is now a general complex
number Sigma plus jail maker

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,800 
these two expressions in fact are
identical

143
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,760 
if in fact Sigma is equal to 0

144
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,649 
if signatures equal to 0 so that ass is
just jail maker

145
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,959 
then all that this transformation is

146
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,829 
is the same as that substitute in s
equals jail maker

147
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:47,540 
and this is what we get so

148
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,220 
what this then tells us is dead if we
have the apostrophe it's for

149
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,950 
and if we look at the applause transform
at

150
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,670 
ass equals J Omega

151
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,230 
then that in fact corresponds to

152
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,410 
the Fourier transform affect safety

153
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,240 
now there's a slight notational issue

154
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,550 
that this raises and it's very
straightforward to clean it up

155
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,079 
but it's something that its you have to
just kinda

156
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,430 
focus on for second to understand what
the issue is

157
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,690 
notice that on the left hand side of
this equation

158
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,540 
X a vast representing the applause
transform

159
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,910 
when we look at that would signal to 0
RS equal to jail maker

160
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,060 
are natural inclination is to write that

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,100 
as exit J Omega of course

162
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,790 
on the other hand the right hand side of
the equation namely the Fourier

163
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,660 
transform exit T

164
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,420 
we've typically written as

165
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,250 
X all Omega focusing on the fact that

166
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,600 
it's a function love this variable Omega

167
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,300 
well there's a slight awkwardness here
because here we're talking about

168
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,920 
an argument J Omega here we're talking
about an argument Omega

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,220 
and a very straightforward way of
dealing with that is

170
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,260 
to simply change our notation

171
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,980 
for the Fourier transform recognizing
that the Fourier transform

172
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,209 
course is a function of Omega but it's
also

173
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,420 
in fact the function J Omega and if we
write it that way

174
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,660 
then the two notations come together in
other words the applause transform

175
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,290 
at st. cause jail maker just simply were
reduces both mathematically and

176
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,290 
rotationally

177
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,730 
to the Fourier transform so the notation
that will now be adopting

178
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,260 
for the four th transform is the
notation

179
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,660 
whereby we express the 48 transform no
longer simply as active Omega

180
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,769 
but choosing as the argument jail make

181
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,620 
simple notational change

182
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,380 
now here we see one relationship between
the Fourier transform and

183
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,540 
the the plots transform namely that

184
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,760 
the poss transform pressequals chair
maker reduces to the Fourier transform

185
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,360 
we also have number another important
relationship

186
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,760 
in particular the fact that the

187
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,899 
applause transform can be interpreted

188
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,160 
as the Fourier transform all a modified

189
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,829 
version affect safety let let me show
you what I mean

190
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:36,180 
here of course we have the relationship
that we just developed

191
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,550 
namely s equals jail maker plus
transform reduces the Fourier transform

192
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,449 
but now let's look at the more general
applause transform expression

193
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,750 
and if we substitute in s equals Sigma
plus J Omega

194
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,820 
which is the general form for this
complex variable ass

195
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,519 
and we carry through so the algebra

196
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,810 
breaking this into the product up to
exponential

197
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,980 
the product the two exponential see the
minus Sigma T

198
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,630 
time see the minus jail make it to the
we now have

199
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,190 
this expression where of course in both
these

200
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,170 
their is a DT

201
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,480 
and now when we look at this

202
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,550 
what we observe is that this in fact

203
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,899 
is the 48 transform of something

204
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,420 
what's the something it's not accept T
anymore it's the Fourier transform up

205
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,730 
x50

206
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,720 
multiplied by e2 the minus Sigma T

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,750 
so if we think I've these two terms
together

208
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,940 
this in a brawl is just the four EA
transform

209
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,509 
it's the for a transformer Beck city
multiplied

210
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,380 
by an exponential Sigma is greater than
0

211
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,600 
its a an exponential that

212
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,149 
the case with time Sigma is less than 0
it's an exponential the crows

213
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,670 
time so we have

214
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,699 
then this additional relationship which
tells us that the apostrophe s for

215
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:15,070 
is the 48 transform love

216
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,610 
and exponentially weighted time function

217
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,449 
now this exponential weighting has

218
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,949 
some important significance in
particular

219
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:31,899 
recall that there were issues have
convergence with the 48 transform in

220
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,579 
particular the Fourier transform

221
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,819 
may or may not converge and for
convergence in fact

222
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,660 
what's required is that but I'm
fortunate we're transforming be

223
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,829 
absolutely integral now

224
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,250 
we can have a time function that isn't
absolutely integral

225
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,009 
because let's say it grows exponentially
as time

226
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:59,259 
increases but when we multiply it by
this

227
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,579 
exponential factor that's embodied in a
posh transform

228
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,980 
in fact that brings the function back
down for positive time

229
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,620 
and will impose absolute integrability

230
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,050 
on the product %uh XFT times

231
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,620 
e2 the minus Sigma T and so

232
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,970 
the conclusion an important point is
that

233
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,579 
the applause transformed the Fourier
transform this product may converge

234
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,639 
even though the Fourier transform
effective t doesn't in other words

235
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,029 
the apostrophe s form may converge even
when the Fourier transform

236
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,850 
doesn't converge and will see that will
see examples of it is the discussion

237
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,920 
goes along now let me also

238
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920 
draw your attention to the fact although
we won't be

239
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,720 
working through this in detail

240
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,889 
to the fact that this equation

241
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,459 
in effect provides the basis

242
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,829 
for us to figure out how to express
accept T

243
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,110 
interns love the applause transform

244
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,370 
effect we can apply the inverse Fourier
transform to this

245
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,630 
thereby to this account for the
exponential factor by bring it over to

246
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,980 
the other side

247
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,129 
and if you go through this and in fact

248
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,620 
you'll have an opportunity to go through
this both in the video course manual

249
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,750 
and also it's carried through in the
text

250
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,029 
what you end up with is

251
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,490 
a synthesis equation X expression for
exit T

252
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,709 
in terms of Xmas which corresponds to a
synthesis equation

253
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,699 
and which now builds x50 I have a linear
combination if not

254
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,579 
necessarily functions the foreign to the
Chi Omega TV

255
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,079 
but interns love functions

256
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,339 
or basic signals which are more general
exponentials

257
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,829 
you to the st.

258
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:59,180 
okay well let's just look at

259
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,339 
some examples love the apostrophe s form
of some time functions

260
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,819 
and these examples that I'll go through

261
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,970 
are all examples that are worked out in
attacks and so I don't want to focus on

262
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,620 
the algebra what I'd like to focus on

263
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,440 
are some with the issues and the
interpretation

264
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,140 
let's first the ball look at example

265
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,819 
the example in the text which is example
9.1

266
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,370 
if we take the Fourier transform

267
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,580 
love this exponential then as you well
know

268
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,050 
the result that we have is one over J
Omega plus a

269
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,070 
and bekannt converge for any a

270
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,690 
in particular it's only for a greater
than 0

271
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,210 
what that really means is that for
convergence of the 48 transform this has

272
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,250 
to be

273
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,700 
a decaying exponential it can't be

274
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,289 
in increasing exponentially if

275
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,970 
instead we apply the applause
transformed to this

276
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,460 
applying to the the deal applies
transform is the same as taking the 48

277
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,520 
transform or

278
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,080 
X 50 times an exponential in and

279
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,740 
the exponential that we would multiply
by is he to the minus Sigma T

280
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,789 
so in effect taking the applause
transform of this

281
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:26,010 
is like taking the Fourier transform
augie to the minus eighty

282
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,900 
e2 the minus Sigma T

283
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,159 
and if we carry that through just

284
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,250 
working through the integral we end up

285
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,120 
with applause transform which is one
over est plus a

286
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,130 
but just as in the Fourier transform

287
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,549 
the Fourier transform all converge for
any a

288
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,720 
now what happens is that the

289
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,020 
love pasta Rance form will only converge

290
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,419 
when the forty a transformer this
converges

291
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,049 
said another way it's when the
combination is a plus Sigma

292
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:08,929 
is greater than 0 so we would require

293
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,549 
that by right over here a plus Sigma

294
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,309 
is greater than 0 warmer that Sigma

295
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:20,740 
is greater than minus a so in fact

296
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,799 
in the apostrophe s former this

297
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,590 
we have an expression one over est plus
a but

298
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,070 
we also require in interpreting that

299
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,750 
dead the real party bass be greater

300
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,400 
then minus a so that

301
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,120 
essentially the 48 transform up X 50

302
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,309 
times you to the minus Sigma T converges

303
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,390 
so it's important to recognize that the

304
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,900 
algebraic expression that we get is

305
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,530 
only valid for certain values love the
real party vez

306
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,419 
and so for this example we can summarize
it as

307
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,090 
this exponential as the apostrophe s
form which is one over est plus a

308
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,710 
where ass is restricted to the range the
real party best greater than

309
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,250 
minus a now

310
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,030 
we haven't had this issue before love
restrictions on what the value a veces

311
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,870 
with the with 48 transform either
recover Jordan converge

312
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,280 
with a plot strands form there are
certain values the best we now have more

313
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,299 
flexibility and so they're certain
values are the real party best for which

314
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,370 
it converges in certain values for which
it doesn't

315
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,980 
the values Ave S for which the
apostrophe s form

316
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,780 
converges is the values

317
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,340 
are referred to as the region of
convergence

318
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,429 
up the applause transform

319
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,950 
and it's important to recognize that

320
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,330 
in specifying the applause transform
what's required is not only the

321
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,260 
algebraic expression

322
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,860 
but also the domain or set of values
evas

323
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,320 
for which that algebraic expression is

324
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,169 
ballot just two

325
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,210 
underscore that point let me draw your
attention to another

326
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,890 
example in the text which is example 9.2

327
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,630 
example 9.2 we have an exponential

328
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,039 
for negative time 0 for positive time

329
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,380 
and if you carry through the algebra
there you end up with

330
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,659 
a low price transform expression which
is again one over S plus a

331
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:44,409 
exactly the same algebraic expression as
we head for the previous example

332
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:47,980 
the important distinction is that now

333
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,909 
the real party bass is restricted to be
less than minus a

334
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:56,380 
it so in fact if you compare this
example

335
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,600 
with the one above it and let's just
look back at

336
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,360 
the answer that we had the air

337
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,620 
if you compare that those two examples
here

338
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,150 
the algebraic expression is 100 breast
but say with a certain

339
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,320 
regional convergence here

340
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,169 
the algebraic expression is one over est
plus a

341
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:22,130 
and the only difference between those
two is the domain a region of

342
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,990 
convergence

343
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,820 
so there's another complication or twist
now

344
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,169 
not only do we need to generate the
algebraic expression

345
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,480 
but we also have to be careful to
specify

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,580 
the region of convergence

347
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,279 
over which that algebraic expression is
valid

348
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,130 
now later on in this lecture and
actually also

349
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,289 
arm as the discussion a little past
transform goes on

350
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,429 
will begin to see and understand more
about

351
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,880 
how the region of convergence relates to

352
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,059 
various properties of the time function

353
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,150 
okay well let's finally look at one
additional example from the tax

354
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,230 
and this is example 9.3 and what it
consists of

355
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,070 
is the a type function which is the sum

356
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,289 
love two exponentials and

357
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,970 
although we haven't formally talked
about properties a little fuss transform

358
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,640 
yet

359
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,789 
what are the properties that will see it
is relatively easy to develop

360
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,010 
is the fact that the apostrophe s form
of Assam

361
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,640 
is the summer the applause transform so
in fact we can get

362
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,240 
the applause transform love the solo
these two terms

363
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,200 
as some love the apostrophe its forms

364
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,760 
and so for this one we know from the

365
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,770 
example that we at looked at previously
example 9.1

366
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,950 
that this is a form one over est plus
one

367
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,799 
with a region of convergence which is
the real party best greater than -1

368
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,760 
for this one we have a poss transform
which is one over est plus two

369
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,710 
with a region of convergence which is
the real party bass

370
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,929 
greater than -2 so

371
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:18,150 
for the two of them together we have to
take the overlap with those two regions

372
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,679 
in other words we have to take the
region that encompasses both the real

373
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,520 
party best greater than -1

374
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,899 
in the real party best greater than -2
and if we put those together then

375
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,950 
we have a combined regional convergence
which is the real party best

376
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,140 
greater than -1 so this is the
expression

377
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,029 
and for this particular example what we
have

378
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:46,169 
is a ratio of polynomials

379
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,590 
the ratio polynomials is a numerator
polynomial and at the nominator

380
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,690 
polynomial

381
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,770 
and it's convenient to

382
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,080 
summarize these by

383
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,539 
plotting the roots love the numerator
polynomial

384
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:06,130 
and the roots to the denominator
polynomial in the complex plane

385
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,640 
and the complex plane which they are
plotted is referred to

386
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,350 
as vs playing

387
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,090 
so we can for example take the
denominator polynomial

388
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,110 
and summarize it in by specifying the
fact

389
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,110 
or by representing the fact

390
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:30,000 
that it has roots at st. cause -1 and at
a Sikh was minus-2

391
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,679 
and I've done that in this picture by
putting an X

392
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,870 
where the roots have the denominator
polynomial order

393
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,529 
the numerator polynomial has a rude ass
equals

394
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:44,820 
-3 hands and i've represented that by a
circle

395
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,250 
so these are the roots to the
denominator polynomial

396
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,890 
and this is the route up the numerator
polynomial for this example

397
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,850 
and also for this example we can
represent

398
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,020 
the region of convergence which

399
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,179 
is the real party best greater than -1
and so that's in fact

400
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,730 
the region over here

401
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,409 
there is also if I draw these just the
router the numerator and denominator

402
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:12,350 
plan of polynomials

403
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,440 
I would need an additional piece of
information

404
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,289 
to specify the algebraic expression
completely namely

405
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:24,200 
multiply constant out in front of the
whole thing

406
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,700 
well this particular example has

407
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,179 
the applause transform as a

408
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,929 
rational function namely its one
polynomial in the numerator and another

409
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,059 
polynomial in the denominator

410
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,230 
and in fact as we'll see applies
transformers which are ratios are

411
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,480 
polynomials

412
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,350 
form a very important class they were in
fact represent systems

413
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,649 
better describe a ball by linear
constant coefficient differential

414
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:51,539 
equations

415
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:56,210 
you shouldn't necessarily in fact for
sure you shouldn't see why

416
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,520 
that's true now will see that later but

417
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520 
that means that a-plus transforms

418
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,710 
that are rational functions namely

419
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,580 
the ratio love the numerator polynomial
divided by the nominator polynomial

420
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,649 
become very important in the discussion
that follows

421
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:23,779 
and in fact in we have some terminology
for this the route so the numerator

422
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:24,940 
polynomial

423
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,140 
are referred to as zeros

424
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,100 
up the applause transform because of
course those are the values a bass

425
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,809 
at which XFS become 0

426
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,130 
and the roots to the denominator
polynomial are

427
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,419 
referred to as the polls up the applause
transform

428
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:47,960 
and those are the values vs

429
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,070 
at which the applause transform blows up

430
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,090 
namely becomes infinite if you think
love setting s

431
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,929 
equal to evaluate this denominator
polynomial goes to zero

432
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,390 
of course extra bass becomes infinite
and

433
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,880 
what we would expect in a course will
see that

434
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,470 
that this is true well we would expect

435
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,960 
is that wherever that happens there must
be some problem

436
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,130 
with convergence oval poss transform and
indeed the applause transformed doesn't

437
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,010 
converge

438
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,360 
at the polls namely at the roots the
denominator polynomial

439
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,130 
so in fact let's focus in on that a
little further

440
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,190 
let's examine and talk about the region
of convergence

441
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,289 
all the applause transform and

442
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,620 
how its associated both with properties
of the time function

443
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,659 
and also with the location love the
polls

444
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,940 
all the applause transform and as we'll
see

445
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,120 
the air are some very specific and
important

446
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,440 
relationships and conclusions that we
can draw

447
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,620 
about how the region of convergence

448
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,370 
is constrained an Associated with the

449
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,850 
locations the polls in the ass point

450
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,899 
well to begin with we can

451
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:13,289 
of course make the statement as I just
made

452
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,279 
that the region of convergence contains
no polls

453
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,309 
in particular if I think

454
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:24,090 
love this general rational function

455
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,690 
the polls love XFS by the values evas

456
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,019 
at which the denominator 0 or equivalent
Lee

457
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,450 
XFS blows up and of course

458
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,980 
then that implies that the expression is
no longer converged

459
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,870 
okay well that's one statement that we
can make now there

460
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,899 
are some others and one for example

461
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:52,250 
is the statement that if I have a point

462
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,580 
in the S plane that corresponds the
convergence

463
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,260 
then in fact any line in the S plane

464
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,610 
with that same real part will also

465
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,610 
be said %uh values for which the
apostrophes form converges

466
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,419 
and what's the reason for that the
reason for that

467
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:14,940 
is dead s is Sigma plus J Omega

468
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,679 
and convergence all the applause
transform is associated with

469
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,549 
convergence love the four EA transform
all

470
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:28,179 
it to the minus Sigma see times X 50

471
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,870 
and so the convergence only depends on
Sigma

472
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,029 
if it only depends on Sigma than

473
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:38,250 
for one if it converges for one value
Sigma

474
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,950 
I'm sorry for what for a value Sigma

475
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,659 
for some valuable maker Danny will
converge

476
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,500 
for that same Sigma for any valuable
make

477
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,240 
the conclusion n is dead the region of
convergence

478
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,110 
if I have a law if I have a point that I
also have a line

479
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,010 
and so what that suggests is that as we
look at the regional convergence

480
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:09,010 
in fact corresponds to strips in the
complex plane

481
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,409 
now finally we can tie together

482
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:15,500 
the region of convergence to the

483
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,289 
convergence of the Fourier transform in
particular since we know that

484
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,200 
the applause transform reduces

485
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,399 
to the 48 transform when

486
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:33,080 
the complex variable yes is Sigma is
equal to jail maker

487
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,429 
the implication is that if we have the
law applies transform

488
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:42,960 
and if the a-plus transform reduces to
the 48 transform

489
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,760 
when sick make 10 in other words when s
is equal to jail make a

490
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,480 
then the 4e a transformative exit see

491
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,730 
converging is equivalent to the
statement

492
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,909 
that the a-plus transform converges

493
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:01,130 
for Sigma equal to 0 in other words that
the region of convergence

494
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,179 
includes what DJ Omega axis

495
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,429 
in the ass point

496
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:15,380 
alright so we have then some statements
that kinda tied together the location of

497
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,230 
the polls

498
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,830 
and the region convergence let me make
one other statement which is

499
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,260 
much harder statement to justify and I
won't try to I just simply stated

500
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,419 
and that is that the regional
convergence oval plus transform

501
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:32,620 
is a connected region in other words

502
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,980 
if the entire region

503
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,870 
consists of a single strap in the S
plane

504
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,409 
it can consist of a strip over here for
example in a strip over there

505
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:50,440 
well let me let me I'm emphasize summer
those points a little further

506
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,669 
let's suppose that I A have

507
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:57,789 
ale a-plus transform

508
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:01,039 
and Google+ transform their

509
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,950 
I am talking about is a rational
function which is

510
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,610 
one over S plus one times as plus two

511
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,149 
then the poll 0 pattern as its referred
to

512
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:17,570 
in the S play in the location love the
roots love the

513
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,750 
numerator and denominator polynomial
course there is no numerator polynomial

514
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,340 
the denominator polynomial roots which
have represented by these X's

515
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,360 
are shown here and so this is

516
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,440 
the poll 0 pattern

517
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,909 
and from what I said the region of
convergence

518
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:40,250 
can't include any polls

519
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,409 
and it must correspond to strips

520
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:47,149 
in the ass plane and furthermore it must
be

521
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:51,630 
just want some one connected region
rather than multiple regions

522
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,909 
and so with this algebraic expression

523
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:59,419 
then the possible choices for the region
of convergence

524
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:02,529 
consistent with those properties are the
following:

525
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,559 
one of them would be region of
convergence

526
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,480 
to the right love this poll

527
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,330 
a second would be a region of
convergence

528
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,800 
which lies between the two poles

529
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,380 
as a show here and

530
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,800 
a third is region of convergence

531
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,200 
which is to the left love this poll

532
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,889 
and because it the fact dead I said
without proof that

533
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,179 
the region of convergence must be a
single strip it can't be multiple strips

534
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,940 
in fact we could not consider as a
possible region convergence

535
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,370 
what I show here in so in fact

536
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,740 
this is not a valid region of
convergence

537
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,500 
there are only three possibilities
Associated

538
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,940 
with this poll 0 pattern namely to the
writer this poll

539
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,510 
between the two poles and to the left
that this poll

540
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,590 
now to carry the discussion further

541
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,480 
we can in fact associate

542
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,660 
the region of convergence above the law
applies transform

543
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,940 
with some very specific characteristics

544
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,030 
of the time function and what this will
do is to help us understand

545
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,050 
how various for various choices

546
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,520 
love the region of convergence the
interpretation

547
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,320 
that we can impose on the related time
function

548
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,360 
let me show you what I mean

549
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,260 
suppose that we start with

550
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,190 
a time function as i indicated here

551
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,900 
which is a finite

552
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,380 
duration time function in other words
it's zero

553
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,700 
except in some time interval now

554
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,490 
recall that the Fourier transform
converges

555
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,740 
if the time for action has the property

556
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,360 
that is absolutely integral and as long
as everything stays finite and

557
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,790 
interns have ample to in a finite
duration signal

558
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,810 
there's no difficulty that we're gonna
run into here

559
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:22,060 
now here the Fourier transform will
converge and now

560
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,020 
the question is what can we say about
the reach of convergence

561
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,310 
of the apostrophe it's for well

562
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,440 
the applies transform is the Fourier
transform

563
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,750 
all the time function multiplied by an
exponential

564
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,700 
and so we can ask a pan out whether we
can destroy the absolute integrability

565
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,150 
of this

566
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,690 
by multiplying by an exponential that
the case

567
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,140 
that grows too fast in the case too fast
to whatever let's take a look at that

568
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,290 
suppose that this time function

569
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,390 
is absolutely integral and

570
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,650 
let's multiply it by

571
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,830 
a decaying exponential so this is now
except eat I'm see the minus Sigma T

572
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,980 
if I think multiplying these two
together

573
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,910 
and what you can see is that for
negative for positive time

574
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,050 
sort of thinking informally I'm helping

575
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,630 
the integrability of the product because
I'm pushing this part down

576
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,020 
for negative time unfortunately I'm
making things bro

577
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:33,240 
but I don't let them grow indefinitely
because there's some time before which

578
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,050 
this is equal to 0 likewise

579
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:43,310 
if I head a growing exponential

580
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,910 
then for a growing exponential

581
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,150 
for negative time or for this part
perhaps

582
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,090 
this part making things smaller for
positive time eventually this expansion

583
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,960 
was growing without

584
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,390 
found but the time function stocks at
some point

585
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,080 
so the idea then kinda is dead

586
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,570 
for a finite duration

587
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,300 
time function no matter what kinda
exponential I multiply by whether it's

588
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,190 
going this way are going this way
because of the fact that

589
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,280 
essentially the limits on the integral
are fine I'd I'm

590
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,350 
guaranteed that'll always maintain
absolute integrability

591
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,900 
and so in fact then for a finite
duration time function

592
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,770 
the region of convergence is the entire
s play

593
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,780 
okay now in we can also

594
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,460 
make statements about other kinds of
time functions

595
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,590 
and let's look

596
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,780 
at a time function

597
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,220 
which I a defined as a right-sided

598
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,410 
time function and

599
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,450 
a right-sided time function is one which

600
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,830 
is 0 up until sometime and then

601
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:08,050 
it goes on after that presumably off to
infinity

602
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,160 
now let me remind you that

603
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,380 
the whole issue here with the region of
convergence

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,080 
has to do with exponentials

605
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,770 
that we can multiply a time function by

606
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,510 
and have the product end up being
absolutely integral

607
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,240 
well supposed dead when I multiply this
time function

608
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,430 
by an exponential which lets ATK's

609
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,410 
but an exponentially to the minus Sigma
0t

610
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,740 
what you can see me sort of intuitively
is dead if

611
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,960 
this product is absolutely integral

612
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,270 
if I would increase Sigma 0 then I'm
making things even better for positive

613
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,640 
time because I'm pushing them down

614
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,300 
and whereas they might be worse for
negative time

615
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,050 
that doesn't matter because before some
time

616
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:06,770 
the product is equal to 0 so if this
product is absolutely an agreeable

617
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,910 
then if are chosen exponential

618
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,280 
it's a minus signal one teeny where
signal one

619
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,620 
is greater than 60 then that product

620
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,790 
will also be absolutely integral ball
and we can draw

621
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,430 
important conclusion about that about
the region of convergence from that

622
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,530 
in particular we can make this statement

623
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,560 
dead if the time function is right sided

624
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,580 
and if convergence

625
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,110 
occurs for some value segment 0

626
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,820 
then in fact we will have convergence of
the law applies transform

627
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,690 
for all values all the real party bass

628
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,710 
greater than Sigma 0 the reason

629
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,580 
of course being dead if Sigma 0
increases

630
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:03,190 
then the exponential DK's even faster
for positive time

631
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,020 
now what that says then thinking another
way enters the region of convergence

632
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,340 
as we might droid in the ass plane is
that

633
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,650 
if we have a point that's in the region
of convergence corresponding to some

634
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,640 
value Sigma 0

635
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,900 
band all values evas to the right of
that

636
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,360 
in the S plane will also be in the
region convergence

637
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,310 
we can also combine that with the
statement that for rational functions

638
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,460 
we know dead there can't be any polls

639
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,480 
in the region of convergence if you put
those two statements together

640
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,080 
then we end up with a statement dead if

641
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,820 
x50 is right sided and if it's a plus
transformers rational

642
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,590 
then the region of convergence is to the
right

643
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,750 
up the rightmost poll so

644
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,110 
we have here a very important insight
which tells us

645
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,300 
dead weekend im in for some property

646
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,680 
about the time function from the region
of convergence

647
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,010 
or conversely if we know something about
the time function namely being right

648
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:07,950 
sided

649
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,540 
then we can infer something about the
regional convergence

650
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,040 
well in addition to right-sided

651
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,510 
signals we can also have left sided
signals

652
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,900 
Analects I did signal is essentially a
right-sided signal turned around

653
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,990 
in other words a left-sided signal is
one

654
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,850 
that is zero after some time

655
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,570 
well we can carry out exactly the same
kind of argument there

656
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,610 
namely if the signal goes off to
infinity in the negative time direction

657
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,470 
and stops

658
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:44,340 
someplace for positive time if I have an
exponential

659
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,610 
I can multiply it by and have that
product be absolutely integral ball

660
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,350 
but if I choose an exponential that
decays even faster for negative times

661
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,040 
that I'm pushing the stuff

662
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,200 
way out there down even further then

663
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,840 
II enhance the integrability even more

664
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,220 
an you might have to think through that
a little bit but it's exactly

665
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,890 
the flip side of the argument for
right-sided signals

666
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,410 
and the conclusion and is dead

667
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,450 
if we have a left-sided signal

668
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,850 
and we have a point a value up the real
party best which is in the region of

669
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,060 
convergence

670
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,510 
then in fact all values

671
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,530 
to the left at that point in the S plane

672
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,490 
will also be in the region of
convergence

673
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,090 
now solar to the statement that we made
for right-sided signals

674
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:40,730 
if expertise left-sided and in fact
we're talking about a rational applies

675
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,270 
transform which we most

676
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,670 
typically well then in fact we can make
the statement

677
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,070 
there the region of convergence is to
the left

678
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:53,080 
of the leftmost poll because

679
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,650 
we know it has if we find a point that's
in the region of convergence

680
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,870 
everything to the left then has to be in
the region of convergence

681
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,560 
we can have any polls in the region of
convergence you put those two statements

682
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,680 
together and it says

683
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,700 
is to the left the leftmost poll

684
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,970 
now the final situation is the situation
where

685
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,430 
we have a signal which is neither right
side or left side it goes off to

686
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,420 
infinity for positive time

687
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,720 
and it goes off to infinity for negative
time and their the thing to kinda

688
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,260 
recognizes that

689
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,670 
if you multiply by an exponential and
its decaying

690
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,080 
very fast for positive time it's gonna
be growing very fast for negative time

691
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,110 
conversely if it became very fast for
negative time is growing very fast for

692
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,490 
positive time

693
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,760 
and this kind of this notion of trying
to balance the value Sigma

694
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,930 
and in effect with that says is that the
region of convergence can't

695
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,190 
extent too far to the left or too far to
the right

696
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,830 
said another way for a two-sided

697
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,330 
signal and if we have a point which is
in the region of convergence

698
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,740 
than that point defines

699
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,340 
strip in the ass plane dead takes

700
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,970 
that point and extends it to the left
until you bump into a pole

701
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,240 
an extensive to the right until you bump
into a pole

702
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,860 
fight so he you begin today and see that

703
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,460 
we can tie together some properties in
the region of convergence

704
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,980 
and the right-sided mister left-sided
mister two-sided NIS

705
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,500 
love the time function and you have a
chance to examine that

706
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,020 
in more detail in the video course
manual

707
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,510 
let's conclude this lecture by talking
about

708
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,960 
how we might get the time function

709
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,040 
given the low class transformed

710
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,680 
well if we have a plus transform we can

711
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,990 
in principle get the time function back
again by

712
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,270 
recognizing this relationship between
the applause transform

713
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,660 
and the 48 transform and using the
formal for EA transform expression

714
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,470 
or quietly the formal inverse Laplace
transform

715
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,930 
expression which is in the tax but more
typically what we would do is

716
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,320 
what we've done also with the Fourier
transform

717
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,610 
which is to use simple

718
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:20,890 
plus transform pairs together with the
notion

719
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,190 
all the partial fraction expansion and

720
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:28,030 
let's just go through that with an
example

721
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,560 
let's suppose that I have

722
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,410 
a a-plus transform as i indicated here

723
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:39,670 
and its polls are applied and a region
of convergence which

724
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,730 
is to the right if this poll and what we
can identify

725
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,000 
from the region of convergence in fact
is that we're talking

726
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,680 
about a right-sided time function

727
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,900 
so the rear richer convergence is the
real party best greater than -1

728
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,180 
and now looking down at the algebraic
expression

729
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,590 
we have the algebraic expression for
this is i indicate here

730
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,320 
acquittal on tlie expanded in a partial
fraction expansion

731
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,240 
as a show below so if you just simply
combine these together

732
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,040 
that's the same as this and the region
of convergence

733
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,410 
is the real party bass greater than -1

734
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,840 
now the region of convergence or

735
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,160 
this is a solid to turn so the the time
function is this summer to time

736
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,330 
functions

737
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,390 
and the region of convergence

738
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,490 
all love the combination must be

739
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,960 
the intersection of the region of
convergence associated with each one

740
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,750 
recognizing that this is to the right of
the polls

741
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,110 
that tells us immediately that each of
these two

742
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,650 
then would correspond to bill plus
transform

743
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,170 
love a right-sided time function

744
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,890 
well let's look at it term by term

745
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:05,930 
the first term is the factor 1 over s
plus one

746
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:10,620 
with the region of convergence to the
right if this poll

747
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,450 
and this hat algebraically

748
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,720 
corresponds to what i've indicated and
this in fact

749
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,600 
is similar to or special case if the

750
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,700 
example that we pointed to at the
beginning at the lecture namely example

751
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,980 
9.1

752
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,630 
and so we can just simply use that
result if you think back

753
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,780 
to that example or refer to your notes
we know

754
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,040 
dead time function of the form

755
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,730 
eat to -80 gives us all a plus transform
which is one over S Plus

756
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,550 
a with the real party bass greater than

757
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:50,530 
minus a and so this is the applause
transformer the first

758
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,320 
or sorry this is the inverse the poss
transform the first term

759
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,480 
if we now consider the poll add

760
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,270 
s equals -2

761
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,790 
and here is the region of convergence
that we originally began with

762
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,660 
in fact we can having removed the pole
at -1

763
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,720 
extend this region of convergence

764
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,380 
to this poll and we now have

765
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,610 
an algebraic expression which is -1 over
s plus

766
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:26,350 
to the real party best greater than -1

767
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,980 
although in fact we can extend the
region of convergence

768
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,620 
up to the poll and the inverse

769
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,800 
transformer this is now again

770
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,830 
referring to the same example minus you
to the -2 T

771
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,770 
times a unit step and if we simply

772
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,650 
put the two turns together then

773
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:53,340 
adding the one that we have here to what
we had before

774
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,110 
we have a total inverse Laplace
transform

775
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,860 
which is that

776
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,140 
so essentially what's happened is dead

777
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,830 
each of the ex each over the polls has
contributed

778
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:12,260 
an exponential factor and because if the
region of convergence

779
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,360 
being to the right of all those polls
that

780
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,610 
is consistent with the notion that both
of those terms correspond to right-sided

781
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,860 
time functions

782
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,880 
well it's just the focus for

783
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,240 
for a second or two on the same

784
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,270 
Posey role pattern but instead I love

785
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,950 
a region of convergence which is to the
right at the polls

786
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,030 
as we had before well now take a region
of convergence which is between the two

787
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,280 
poles

788
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,980 
and I'll let you work through this more
leisurely

789
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,900 
in the video course manual but when we
carry out the partial fraction expansion

790
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,940 
as I've done below

791
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,980 
we would now associate with this poll

792
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,700 
a regional convergence to the right with
this poll

793
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,220 
a region of convergence to the left

794
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,560 
and so while what we would have

795
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,530 
is the sum love a right-sided time
function due to this poll

796
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,600 
and in fact that serve the form you to
the minus T

797
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,690 
pretty positive and a left-sided

798
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,310 
type function due to this poll

799
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,570 
and in fact that serve the form in the
minus two TV

800
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,960 
pretty negative and so in fact

801
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,770 
the answer that we will get when we
decompose this

802
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:40,350 
use the partial fraction expansion being
very careful

803
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,690 
about associating the region of
convergence

804
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:47,240 
this poll to the right and if this poll
to the left

805
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,610 
will have then when we're all done a
time

806
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,270 
function which will be of the form eats
the minus

807
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,710 
T times a unit step pretty positive

808
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,380 
and then we'll have a term of the for me

809
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,180 
to the I'm sorry this would-be to the
minus 2 T's since this is at -2 in this

810
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,460 
is

811
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,610 
-1 this would be a plus sign in this
would be minus

812
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:15,300 
you to the minus the for TE negative

813
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,220 
and you look at that a little more
carefully when

814
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,940 
I you sit down with the video course
manual

815
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,690 
okay well what we've gone through rather
quickly is

816
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,470 
an introduction to the applause
transform

817
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,230 
and a couple points to underscore again

818
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:40,940 
is the fact that the applause transform
is very closely associated

819
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,530 
with the Fourier transform and in fact
the applause transform

820
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,600 
4s equals jail maker reduces to the 48
transform

821
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,650 
but more generally the a-plus transform
is the 48 transform

822
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,850 
love x50 with

823
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:03,920 
an exponential weighting and there are
some exponentials for which that product

824
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,170 
converges there are other exponentials
for which

825
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,790 
that product has a Fourier transform
that doesn't converge

826
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:15,410 
bad then imposes on the discussion above
plus transform

827
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,840 
what we refer to as the region of
convergence

828
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:24,800 
and it's very important to understand
that in specifying a a-plus transform

829
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,680 
it's important to identify not only

830
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,550 
the algebraic expression but also the
values the best namely

831
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,590 
for which it it's valid namely

832
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:42,080 
the region of convergence low class
transformed finally what we did was to

833
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,550 
tied together some properties over time
function

834
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,460 
with things that we can say about the
regional convergence office supplies

835
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,020 
transform

836
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,860 
now just as with the Fourier transform
the applause transformer has some very

837
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:01,180 
important properties and I love these
properties both

838
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:06,200 
are some mechanisms for using a fast
transforming

839
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,940 
for such such systems as linear cut
those described by a linear cut the

840
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,280 
coefficient

841
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,620 
differential equations but more
importantly

842
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:20,690 
the properties will help us as we
understand the further

843
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,630 
will help us in using exploiting

844
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,370 
the appliance transform to study and
understand

845
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,370 
linear time-invariant systems and

846
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:36,070 
thats what will go on to next time in
particular

847
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:39,900 
talking about properties and then
associating

848
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,600 
with linear time-invariant systems much
of the discussion

849
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,620 
dead we've had today relating

850
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,300 
to the austrians 1 thank you
