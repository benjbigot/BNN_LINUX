for in the last lecture

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,080 
I introduced an illustrated the kinds of
signals and systems that will be dealing

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,530 
with

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,880 
throughout this course in today's
lecture I'd like to

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,610 
be a little more specific and in
particular talk about

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,229 
some the basic signals both
continuous-time and discrete-time

18
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,479 
that will form important building blocks
as

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,840 
the course progresses let's begin

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,790 
with one signal the continuous-time
sinusoidal signal which perhaps you're

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,440 
already

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,820 
somewhat familiar with mathematically

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,790 
the continuous-time sinusoidal signal is
expressed as i've indicated here

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,900 
there are three parameters

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,759 
a Omega 0 and see the parameter a is
referred to as

26
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,520 
the ample to the parameter Omega 0

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,740 
as the frequency and the parameter fee

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,630 
as the face and

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,500 
graphically the continuous-time
sinusoidal signal has the form

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,000 
shown here now

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200 
the sinusoidal signal has a number love

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,180 
important properties that will find it
convenient to exploit as the

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,450 
course goes along one of which is

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,230 
the fact that the sinusoidal signal

35
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,730 
is what is referred to as periodic what
I mean by periodic

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,640 
is that under inappropriate time shift
which I indicate here

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,430 
as t0 the signal replicates

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,459 
or repeats itself force it another way

39
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,680 
if we shift the time origin by an
appropriate amount

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,190 
t0 the smallest value t0 being referred
to as the period

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,069 
then X 50 is equal to itself shifted and

42
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,750 
to demonstrate that we can demonstrated
mathematically

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,790 
by simply substituting into the
mathematical expression for the

44
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,190 
sinusoidal signal

45
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,830 
see plus capital T zero

46
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,850 
in place if T when we carry out the
expansion

47
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,290 
we then have for the argument the
sinusoid

48
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,540 
Omega 0t plus Omega 0

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,570 
capital T zero plus P now

50
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,160 
one of the things that we know about
sinusoidal functions

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,130 
is dead if you change the argument by
any integer multiple

52
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,000 
to pie and the function has the same
value

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,520 
and so we can exploit that here in
particular

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,880 
with Omega 0t0 and integer multiple

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,050 
up to par i then the right hand side of
this equation

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,770 
is equal to the left hand side of the
equation so

57
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,480 
with Omega 0t0 equal to two part times
an integer

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,840 
or t0 equal to two part times an integer

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,400 
divided by Omega 0 the signal repeats
the period is defined as the smallest

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920 
value if t0 and so the period is to pie

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,340 
divided by Omega 0 and going back to

62
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,780 
are sinusoidal signal we can

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,880 
see that and

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,410 
i've indicated here then the period

65
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,389 
as to pie over Omega 0 and that's the
bad you

66
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:30,789 
under which the signal repeats now

67
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,220 
in addition a useful

68
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,080 
property above the sinusoidal signal is
the fact that

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,620 
a timeshare all a sinusoid

70
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,650 
is equivalent to a phase change and we
can demonstrate

71
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,639 
that again mathematically in particular

72
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,280 
if we put the sinusoidal signal under

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,819 
a timeshare i've indicated that the
probe the time shift that i'm talking

74
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,130 
about. by small t0

75
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,440 
and expand this out then

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,590 
we see that that is equivalent to

77
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,450 
a change in phase and important thing to
recognize

78
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,130 
about this statement is that not only is
a timeshare

79
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,730 
generating a phase change but in fact

80
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,510 
if we inserted a phase change

81
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,740 
there is always a value if t0

82
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,470 
which would correspond to

83
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,530 
an equivalent I'm ship said another way

84
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,389 
if retake Omega 0t0

85
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,889 
and think of that as are change in phase

86
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,580 
for any change in phase we can solve
this equation for timeshift

87
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,860 
or conversely for any value timeshare
that

88
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,730 
represents an appropriate face

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,060 
so a time shift corresponds to a phase
change

90
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,950 
and a phase change likewise corresponds
to it I'm ship

91
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,360 
and so for example if we

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,139 
look at the sinusoidal signal

93
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,150 
the general sinusoidal signal that we

94
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,460 
saw previously in effect changing the
phase

95
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,060 
corresponds to moving this signal in
time

96
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,620 
one way or the other for example if we
look at the sinusoidal signal with

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,120 
a phase equal to 0 that corresponds

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,910 
to locating the time origin at this p

99
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,430 
and i've indicated that on

100
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,820 
the following grass

101
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,699 
so here we have illustrated a sinusoid

102
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,540 
with zero phase or cosine with zero
phase

103
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,880 
corresponding to taking a general
picture and shifting it

104
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,740 
shifting it appropriately as i've
indicated here

105
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,870 
this of course still has the property
that it's a periodic function

106
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,520 
since we simply displaced in time

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,370 
and by looking at the graph what we see
is that it has another very important

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,580 
property

109
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,990 
a property referred to as even and

110
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,199 
that's a property that will find it
useful in general

111
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,970 
to refer to in relation to signals a
signal is said to be even

112
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,820 
if when we reflected about the origin it
looks exactly the same so it's a metric

113
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,389 
about the origin and looking at

114
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,020 
this sinusoid that in fact has that
property

115
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,240 
and mathematically this statement that
it's even is equivalent to the statement

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,300 
that if we replace the time argument

117
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,449 
by its negative the function itself

118
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,310 
doesn't change

119
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,259 
now this corresponded to a phase shift 0
in our original

120
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,820 
cosine expression if instead we had

121
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,470 
chosen a phase shift love let's say
minus pie over to

122
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,880 
then is that a a cosigner so it'll
signal

123
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,770 
well we would generate is a sinusoid

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,360 
with the appropriate phase or

125
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,509 
said another way if we take are

126
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,280 
original cosine and

127
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,710 
substitute in for the phase minus pie
over to

128
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,919 
then of course we have this mathematical
expression

129
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,599 
using just straight for trigonometric
identities

130
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,820 
we can express that alternately as
signed Omega 0t

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,640 
the frequency and amplitude of course
haven't changed and

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,350 
that you can convince yourself also is
equivalent

133
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,750 
to shifting the cosine by

134
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,649 
and a mountain time that I've indicated
here namely

135
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,480 
a quarter of the period so illustrated
below

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,740 
is the graph now when

137
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,779 
we have a phase of mine espy over to an
arc cosine

138
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:08,320 
which is a sinusoidal signal of course
it's still

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,050 
periodic its periodic with a period of
two pi

140
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,370 
over Omega 0 again because all that
we've done

141
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,650 
by introducing a phase change is

142
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,420 
introduce the timeshare now

143
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,570 
when we look at the sinusoid in
comparison with the Cosi namely with

144
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,520 
this particular choice a phase

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,100 
this has a different symmetry and

146
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,770 
that symmetry is referred to as odd what
ought symmetry means

147
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,900 
graphically is that when we flipped the
signal

148
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,550 
about the origin

149
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,010 
but I margin we also multiply it by a
minus sign

150
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,790 
so thats in effect antisymmetric

151
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,890 
it it's not the mirror image but it's
the mirror image flipped over

152
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,110 
and will find many occasions not only to
refer to signals more general and

153
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,740 
sinusoidal signals as

154
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,520 
even in some cases and odd in other
cases

155
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,850 
and in general mathematically

156
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,950 
on signal is one which

157
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,890 
has satisfy is the algebraic expression

158
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,930 
that exit see when you replace

159
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,140 
TE by its negative is equal to

160
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,870 
minus exit -2 so replacing the argument
by its negative

161
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,070 
corresponds to time River I A

162
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,570 
an algebraic sign rivers

163
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,890 
okay so in this is the class of
continuous-time

164
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,120 
sinusoids will have a little more to say
about it later

165
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,230 
but I've now like to turn to

166
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,430 
discrete-time sinusoids what we'll see
is that discrete-time sinusoids

167
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,220 
are very much like continuous-time ones
but also

168
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,270 
with some very important differences and
we want to focus not only on the

169
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,370 
similarities

170
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,200 
but also on the differences well let's
begin

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040 
with the mathematical expression a

172
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,220 
discrete-time sinusoidal signal
mathematically

173
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,500 
is as i've indicated here a cosine

174
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,940 
Omega 0 and plus the and just says

175
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,770 
in the continuous-time case the
parameter

176
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,890 
a is what we refer to as the airport to

177
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,920 
Omega 0 as the frequency and see

178
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,080 
as the face

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,140 
and I've illustrated

180
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,380 
here several discrete-time

181
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,670 
sinusoidal signals and they kinda

182
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,660 
look similar in fact if you sort of
track what you might think of is the

183
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,690 
envelope

184
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,060 
it looks very much like what a
continuous-time sign outside so it might

185
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,750 
look like

186
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,310 
but keep in mind day at the independent
variable in this case

187
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,810 
isn't integer variable and so

188
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,840 
the sequence in fact only takes on bag
use

189
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,500 
at integer values up the argument and
we'll see

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,970 
that that has a a very important

191
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,510 
implication and will see that shortly
now

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,230 
one of the issues that we addressed in
the continuous-time cases periodicity

193
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,620 
and I want to refer or return to that

194
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,570 
shortly because that is in fact one of
the areas where there is an important

195
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,570 
distinction

196
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,400 
let's first

197
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,290 
though examine the statement similar to
the one

198
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,960 
the week salmon for continuous-time
namely the relationship between the time

199
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,690 
shift in a phase change

200
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,950 
now in continuous-time

201
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,660 
course we saw that a timeshare
corresponds to a phase change in

202
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,190 
vice versa let's first look at

203
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,090 
the relationship between shifting time
and generating a change in phase

204
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,520 
in particular for discrete-time if

205
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,300 
in fact I implement a timeshare that

206
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400 
generates a phase change and we can see
that

207
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,920 
easily by simply inserting a timeshare

208
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,380 
employs an 0 and if we expand at this
argument we have

209
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,700 
Omega 0 and plus Omega 0n0

210
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,070 
and so I've done that on the right hand
side of the equation

211
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,200 
year and the

212
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,830 
Omega 0n0 then simply corresponds to

213
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,440 
a change in phase so clearly

214
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,690 
a shift in time generates

215
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,140 
a change in phase and

216
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,080 
for example if we take a particular

217
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,460 
sinusoidal signal let's say we take the
cosine signal

218
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,930 
at a particular frequency and with a
phase equal to 0

219
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,350 
a sequence that we might generate is

220
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,050 
one that I've illustrated here so

221
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,500 
when I'm illustrating here is the cosine

222
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,830 
signal with 0 theta is

223
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,860 
and it has a particular

224
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,620 
behavior to it which will depend someone
on the frequency

225
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,300 
if I now take this same sequence

226
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,610 
and shifted so that the time origin

227
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,230 
shifted a quarter of a period away then

228
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,320 
you can convince yourself and it's
straightforward

229
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,820 
to work out that that timeshare
corresponds to a phase shift

230
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,880 
of pie over to so

231
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,170 
in that case with the cosine

232
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,540 
with a phase minus pie over to

233
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,540 
that will correspond to the expression

234
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,380 
that I have here

235
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,230 
we can alternately right that using a
get a trigonometric identity as sin

236
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,750 
as a sign function and that I've stated

237
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,760 
is equivalent to a timeshare

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,440 
namely this shift the pirate to is equal
to an

239
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,360 
a certain time share and the timeshare
for this particular example

240
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,530 
is in fact the quarter the period

241
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,900 
so here we have

242
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,720 
the sinusoid previously we had the
cosine

243
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,530 
the cosine was exactly the same sequence
but with the Argent located here

244
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,970 
and in fact that's exactly the way we
drew this graph namely

245
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,320 
we just simply took the same values and
change the time origin

246
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,800 
now looking at this sequence which is
the

247
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000 
sinusoidal sequence the phase

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,280 
-5 over to that has a certain symmetry
and in fact what we see is that

249
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,780 
it has an oximetry just as in the
continuous-time case

250
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,290 
namely if we take that sequence flip it
about the axis

251
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,380 
and flip it over and sign then we get
the same sequence back

252
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,270 
whereas with zero phase corresponding

253
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,280 
to the cosine that I show previously
that hasn't even symmetry

254
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,240 
namely if I flipped about the time
margin

255
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,660 
and don't do it sign reversal then the
sequences maintain

256
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,970 
so here we have

257
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,790 
and on symmetry expressed mathematically

258
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,800 
as i've indicated namely

259
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,770 
replacing the independent variable by
its negative

260
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,350 
attach is a negative sign to the whole
sequence

261
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,400 
whereas in a previous case

262
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,890 
what we have is 0 phase

263
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,220 
and and even symmetry

264
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,230 
and that's expressed Mac mathematically
as exit and

265
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,510 
equals X -8

266
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,020 
okay now one of the things I said so far
about discrete-time sinusoids is dead

267
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,210 
a timeshare corresponds to a phase
change

268
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,480 
and weekend then ask whether

269
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,510 
the river statement is also true and we
knew that the river statement was true

270
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,100 
in continuous-time

271
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,190 
specifically is a true

272
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,490 
that a phase change

273
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,510 
always corresponds with time shift

274
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,710 
now we know that that is true namely
that this statement works both ways

275
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,560 
in continuous-time does it in
discrete-time

276
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,060 
well the answer somewhat

277
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,710 
interestingly are surprisingly into you
sit down and think about it

278
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,450 
is no dead it is not

279
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,310 
necessarily true and discrete-time that
any phase change

280
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,080 
can be interpreted as a simple
time-shifted the sequence

281
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200 
and let me just indicate what the
problem is

282
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,320 
if we look

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,510 
at the relationship between the left
side on the right side of this equation

284
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,210 
expanding this out as we did previously
we have that Omega 0n

285
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,060 
plus Omega 0n0 must correspond to Omega
0n plus

286
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,680 
p and so on make 0n0

287
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,120 
must correspond to the phase-change now

288
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,610 
which you can see pretty clearly is
there'd depending

289
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,490 
on the relationship between see an Omega
0

290
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,240 
n0 may or may not come out to be an
integer

291
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,960 
now in continuous-time

292
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,160 
the amount of time shift did not have to
be an integer a map

293
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,210 
indiscreet time when we talk about a
timeshare the amount of time shift

294
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,080 
obviously because the nature
discrete-time signals

295
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,600 
must be an integer so the face changes
related to time shifts

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,250 
must satisfy this particular
relationship

297
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,850 
namely that Omega 0n0

298
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,850 
were n0 is an integer is equal to the
changing face

299
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:30,299 
okay now that's one distinction between
continuous-time and discrete-time

300
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,639 
let's now focus on another one namely
the

301
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,149 
issue of periodicity and what we'll see

302
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:40,669 
is that again whereas in continuous-time

303
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,320 
all continuous-time sinusoids our
periodic

304
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,269 
in the discrete-time case that is not
necessarily true

305
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,929 
to

306
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,840 
explore that little more carefully let's

307
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,629 
looked at the expression again for a
general sinusoidal signal with

308
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:04,919 
an arbitrary effort to frequency and
phase

309
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,049 
and for this to be periodic

310
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,639 
what we require is that there be some
value capital and

311
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:16,759 
under which one we shift the sequence by
that amount

312
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,179 
we get the same sequence back again and
the smallest value capital and

313
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,669 
is what we've defined as the period now

314
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:28,860 
when we try that on a sinusoid we've
core substitute in

315
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,990 
for and little and little and plus
capital and

316
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,360 
and when we expand out the argument

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,509 
here we'll get

318
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,100 
the argument that I have on the right
hand side

319
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,559 
and in order for

320
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,570 
this to repeat in other words in order
for a press in effect

321
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,340 
to discard this term Omega 0 times
capital and where capital is the period

322
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,769 
must be an integer multiple a two-part
and

323
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,909 
in that case its periodic as long as

324
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,639 
Omega 0 times capital and capital in
being the period

325
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:13,340 
is to provide times an integer just
simply dividing this out

326
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,830 
we have capital in the period is to pie
am

327
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,350 
divided by Omega 0 well

328
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,620 
you can say okay what's the big deal a
whatever capital and happens to come out

329
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,610 
to be when we do that a little bit about
your bro that's the period

330
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:34,440 
but in fact capital and or 2 p.m.
divided by Omega 0

331
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,940 
may not ever come out to be an integer
or may not come out to be the one that

332
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,820 
you thought it might

333
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,919 
for example let's look at

334
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,030 
some particular sinusoidal signals

335
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,070 
but say we have the first one here

336
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,210 
which is a sinusoid as I've shown

337
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,870 
and it has a frequency what i've
referred to as the frequency

338
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,550 
Omega 0 equal to two pi divided by 12

339
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,170 
and what we'd like to look at

340
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,260 
is to pry divided by Omega 0

341
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,730 
in effect then find an integer to
multiply that by

342
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,160 
in order to get another manager let's
just try that here

343
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,170 
if we look at to prioritize make a zero

344
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,010 
to pry over Omega 0 for this case is
equal to 12

345
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,780 
well that's fine 12 is an integer

346
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,070 
so what that says in fact is that this
sinusoidal

347
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,990 
signal is periodic and in fact this
period periodic with period of 12

348
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,310 
all right let's look at the next one

349
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,110 
the next one we would have to pile for
Omega 0

350
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,130 
again and that's equal to 31 fourths

351
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,800 
so with that says

352
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,750 
is that the period is 31 forts wait a
minute

353
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,730 
30 1/4 isn't an integer we have to
multiply that by an injured

354
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,770 
to get another integer well we multiply
that by four

355
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,580 
so to pile from a guys there are ties
for is 3131 is an integer

356
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,750 
and so what that says is this is
periodic not with the period up to par

357
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,190 
over make a zero

358
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,260 
by with a period love to pie

359
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,220 
over Omega 0 times for namely with the
period

360
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,550 
I'll 31 finally

361
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,260 
let's take an exam the example where
Omega 0z call to a6

362
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:41,290 
as shown here that actually looks if you
track it with a ride like its periodic

363
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,600 
to pile over Omega 0 in that case

364
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,220 
is equal to 12 pie well

365
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,820 
what integer can I multiplied 12 pie

366
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,390 
by and get another integer the answer is
none

367
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,570 
because pi is an irrational number so in
fact

368
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,000 
what that says is that if you look at

369
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,850 
this sinusoidal signal it's not periodic
at all

370
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,200 
even though you might for yourself into
thinking it is

371
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,740 
simply because the envelope looks
periodic namely the

372
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,310 
continuous-time acquittal with this is
periodic

373
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:26,759 
the discrete-time sequence is not

374
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,659 
okay well we've seen then some

375
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,009 
important distinctions between
continuous-time sinusoidal signals

376
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,549 
and discrete-time sinusoidal signals the
first one

377
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,049 
is the fact that in the continuous-time
case

378
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,409 
a time-shifted phase change are always
equivalent

379
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:49,789 
where's the discrete-time case in effect
that works one way

380
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,239 
but not the other way we've also

381
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:57,539 
seen that for a continuous-time signal

382
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,539 
the continuous-time signal is always
periodic

383
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,460 
whereas the discrete-time signal is not
necessarily

384
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,820 
in particular for the continuous-time
case

385
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,940 
if we have a general expression for the
sinusoidal signal

386
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,399 
that i've indicated here that's periodic

387
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,359 
for any choice Omega 0 whereas

388
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,940 
in a discrete-time case its periodic

389
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,529 
only air Omega 0 is to Poway

390
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:30,109 
well the only if

391
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,700 
to pie over Omega 0 can be multiplied by
integer

392
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,440 
to get another injured now another

393
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,440 
important and as it turns out useful
distinction

394
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,309 
between the continuous-time and
discrete-time case

395
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:49,399 
is the fact that in the discrete-time

396
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,929 
case as we very what I've called the
frequency Omega 0

397
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,419 
we only see

398
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,349 
distinct signals as omega 0

399
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:06,489 
varies over a two-party interval and if
we let Omega 0

400
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:12,580 
very outside the Rangers let's say mine
despite a pirate 0 to 2pi

401
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,210 
will see the same sequences all over
again

402
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,739 
even though at first glance the
mathematical expression might look

403
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:20,179 
different

404
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,599 
so in the discrete-time case

405
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,820 
this classes signals

406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,239 
is identical for values Omega 0

407
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:34,259 
separated by two pi whereas

408
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,349 
in a continuous-time case that is not
true

409
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:42,639 
in particular if I consider the
sinusoidal continuous-time signals

410
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:46,389 
as I very Omega 0

411
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:50,549 
what will happen is that I will always
see

412
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,330 
different sinusoidal signals namely
these won't be

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,320 
and in in effect we can justify

414
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,570 
that statement algebraically and

415
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,929 
I will take the time to do it carefully
but

416
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,739 
let's look first the mall at the
discrete-time

417
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:11,889 
case and a statement that I'm making is
that

418
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:17,299 
if I have to discrete-time sinusoidal
signals

419
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,190 
at two different frequencies and if
these frequencies

420
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,239 
are separated by an integer multiple to
Pine namely

421
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:31,399 
if Omega to is equal to Omega one-plus

422
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:36,139 
to pie times in integer when

423
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,229 
I substitute this into this expression

424
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:42,999 
because it the fact that n is also an
integer

425
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:48,009 
all have am times and as an integer
multiple a two-part

426
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:51,479 
and that term of course will disappear
because the periodicity

427
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:54,769 
the sinusoid and these two sequences
will be equal

428
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:59,210 
on the other hand in the continuous-time
case

429
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,710 
since this is not restricted to be an
integer variable

430
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,859 
since T is not restricted to be an
integer variable

431
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:09,960 
for different values I'll Omega wanna
make it to

432
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,960 
the sinusoidal signals will always be
different

433
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,840 
okay now many of the issues that I
praise

434
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,390 
so far in relation to sinusoidal signals
are elaborated on

435
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,930 
in more detail in the text and of course
you'll have an opportunity

436
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,460 
to exercise so this

437
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,840 
as you worked through the video course
manual

438
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840 
let me stress that

439
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,680 
sinusoidal signals will play an
extremely important role

440
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,010 
for us as building blocks for general
signals

441
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,870 
and descriptions systems and leaves the
whole concept

442
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,990 
all four EA an ala Cys which is very
heavily exploited

443
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,780 
throughout the course

444
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,070 
what i'd now like to turn to in is

445
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,830 
another class love important building
blocks

446
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,210 
and in fact will see that under certain
conditions these relate strongly to

447
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,630 
sinusoidal signals

448
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,710 
namely the Class A real in complex
exponentials

449
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,720 
let me begin first the ball with

450
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,809 
the real exponential and

451
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:25,700 
in particular in the continuous-time
case a real continuous-time exponential

452
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,900 
is mathematically expressed as I

453
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,200 
indicate year X if T all to see

454
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,990 
you to the eighty where for

455
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,400 
the real exponential C&A

456
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,780 
are real numbers and that's what we mean
by the real exponential

457
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,850 
up shortly will also consider complex
exponentials where these numbers can

458
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,410 
then

459
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,549 
become complex so this is an exponential

460
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,600 
function and for example

461
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,679 
if the parameter a is positive

462
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,799 
that means that we have growing
exponential function

463
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,880 
if the parameter a is negative than

464
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,780 
that means dead we have a decaying

465
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,230 
exponential function now

466
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,230 
some weight as an aside its kinda
interesting to note

467
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,630 
that for exponentials a timeshare

468
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,429 
corresponds to a scale change which

469
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,600 
is somewhat different than what happens
with sinusoids

470
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,260 
in the sinusoidal case we saw that a
timeshare

471
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,840 
corresponded to a phase change the real
exponential a timeshare

472
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,270 
as it turns out corresponds to simply
changing the scale

473
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,150 
there's nothing particularly a

474
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,330 
crucial or exciting about that and in
fact

475
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,240 
perhaps stressing it is a little
misleading for general functions of

476
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,830 
course

477
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,600 
about all that you can say about what
happens when you

478
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,850 
implement a timeshare is that implements
a time ship

479
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,299 
okay so here's the real exponential

480
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,130 
just CE to the eighty let's

481
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,890 
look at the real exponential now in the
discrete-time

482
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,540 
case and in the discrete-time case

483
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,210 
we have several alternate ways

484
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,720 
love expressing it we can

485
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,720 
express the real exponential in the four

486
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,740 
see be to the beta N or

487
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,909 
as will find more convenient in part for
reason at all indicate shortly

488
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:41,330 
we can rewrite this as see time's alpha
to the end where course

489
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,350 
alpha is equal to me to the beta

490
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,440 
more typically in a discrete-time case
will express

491
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,510 
the exponential as see times

492
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,020 
alpha to the end so for example this
becomes

493
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,190 
essentially a geometric series a
progression

494
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,049 
as an continues for certain values about

495
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:06,309 
for here for example we have

496
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:10,370 
for alpha greater than 0

497
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,520 
first the ball on the top the case where
the magnitude about the

498
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,720 
is greater than one so that

499
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,370 
this the sequence is exponentially

500
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:26,049 
geometrically growing on the bottom
again without the positive

501
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,669 
but now with its magnitude less than 1

502
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,130 
we have a geometric progression

503
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,140 
that is exponentially or geometrically

504
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,309 
became okay so this

505
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,679 
in both these cases is with alpha
greater than 0

506
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,240 
now the functional were talking about is
alpha to the N

507
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,000 
and of course which you can see is that
if al Phys negative is that a positive

508
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,790 
then when in is even

509
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,860 
that minus sign is gonna disappear when
is Eid

510
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,570 
there will be a minus sign it so for
alpha negative

511
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,210 
the sequences good alternate positive
and negative ads

512
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,950 
so for example here we have

513
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,970 
alpha negative

514
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,550 
and with this magnitude less than one
and you can see that

515
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,190 
again its envelope the case
geometrically

516
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,330 
and the values alternate in sin

517
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,110 
and here we have the magnitude about the
greater than one

518
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,480 
without the negative again they
alternate in signing of course

519
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,730 
its growing geometrically

520
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,059 
now if you think about alpha positive

521
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,149 
and go back to the expression that I
have at the top

522
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:48,630 
namely see times alpha to the end

523
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,390 
with alpha positive

524
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,090 
you can see a straightforward
relationship between

525
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,809 
alpha and beta family beta is

526
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:04,520 
the logarithm natural logarithm a valve

527
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,740 
something to think about is what happens

528
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,869 
if alpha is negative which is of course
a very

529
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:16,310 
important and useful class love real
discreet I'm exponentials also

530
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,070 
well it turns out that without the
negative if you try to express it as see

531
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,770 
me to the beta and then fag beta comes
out to be an imaginary number

532
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,879 
and bad is one but not the only reason

533
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,530 
why in the discrete-time case its of the
most convenient

534
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,919 
to phrase real exponentials

535
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,040 
in the for alpha to the end rather than

536
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,869 
you to the beta and in other words to
express them

537
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:51,869 
in this form rather than in this for

538
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,769 
okay now let's those are real
exponentials continuous-time and

539
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:57,759 
discrete-time

540
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:01,019 
now let's look at the continuous-time

541
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:04,059 
complex exponential and

542
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,079 
what I mean by a complex exponential

543
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,970 
again is an exponential the for

544
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,099 
see you to the eighty him but in this
case

545
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,059 
we allow the parameters C&A to be

546
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,549 
complex numbers and let's just track
this throughout your break Lee

547
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:30,539 
CNA a complex numbers let's write see in
polar form so it has

548
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:36,940 
a magnet to an angle let's write a and
rectangular form so it has a real part

549
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,029 
in an imaginary part and when we
substitute these two

550
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:44,190 
in here combined some things together

551
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,799 
I'll actually having combined yet I have
this

552
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:51,229 
for the amplitude for the effort to
factor

553
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:55,720 
and this for the exponential factor I
can now put a lot of this

554
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,410 
the term corresponding to eat to the RT

555
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,380 
and combine the imaginary parts together
and I come down to the expression that I

556
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,089 
have here

557
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:09,299 
so following this for their

558
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:13,680 
a an exponential this form you to the J

559
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,789 
Omega were either the JC

560
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:20,619 
using Oilers relation can be expressed

561
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,630 
as the some Ave cosine

562
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,829 
was GA times assign

563
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:31,400 
and so that corresponds to this factor

564
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,269 
and then their is this time varying
amplitude factor on top of that

565
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:40,420 
finally putting those together we end up
with the expression

566
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,529 
that I show on the bottom and what this
corresponds to

567
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:48,009 
are to sinusoidal signals

568
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:53,700 
ninety degrees out of phase as indicated
by the fact is a cosine and sine

569
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,859 
so there's a real part in an imaginary
part

570
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,009 
with sinus or does comp on its ninety
degrees out of phase

571
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:05,400 
and a time varying amplitude factor

572
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,690 
which is a real exponential so it's a
sinusoid

573
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,769 
multiplied by real exponential in both
the real part in the imaginary part

574
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:18,319 
and let's just see what one of those
terms might look like

575
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,039 
but i've indicated at the top

576
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,329 
is a sinusoidal signal

577
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,819 
with and exponential time very
exponential

578
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:33,910 
on below or an envelope which is a real

579
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:39,920 
exponential and in particular which is
growing namely with are greater than 0

580
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,319 
and on the bottom i've indicated

581
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,969 
the same thing with are less than zero
and

582
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:51,039 
this kinda sinusoidal signal by the way

583
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,719 
is typically referred to as a damped
sinusoids in

584
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,869 
so what are negative what we have in the
real and imaginary parts

585
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,079 
are damped sinusoids and

586
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,969 
the sinusoidal compliments at that are
ninety degrees out of phase

587
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:13,249 
in the real part and in the imaginary
part okay now

588
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,049 
in the discrete-time case we have more
or less

589
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:20,529 
the same kinda outcome in particular

590
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:24,849 
what will make reference to

591
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,940 
are complex exponentials in a
discrete-time

592
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,619 
case the expression for the complex
exponential

593
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,999 
looks very much like the expression for
the real exponential

594
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:39,210 
except that now we have complex

595
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,670 
factors so see an alpha

596
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,839 
are complex numbers and again

597
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:50,690 
if we tracked through the algebra

598
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,499 
and get to a point where we have

599
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,779 
a real exponential multiplied by a
factor

600
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:02,890 
which is a purely imaginary exponential

601
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,289 
apply Oilers relationship so this

602
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,529 
we then finally come down to a

603
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:15,690 
sequence which has a real exponential

604
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,859 
ample to multiplying

605
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:23,400 
once I saw it in the real part and in
the imaginary part

606
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,599 
exit exactly the same kind of
exponential

607
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,759 
multiplying a sinusoid thats

608
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:33,259 
ninety degrees out of phase from that

609
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:38,390 
and so if we look at what why these
factors might look like

610
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,420 
its what we would expect given

611
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,630 
kind of the analogy with the
continuous-time case

612
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,880 
namely its an exponential or rather a
sinusoidal

613
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,799 
sequence with the a

614
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:56,559 
real exponential on below in the case
were alpha

615
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,369 
is positive then is a growing on below

616
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:04,039 
in the case were out there is negative
I'm sorry

617
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:08,069 
where the magnitude of alpha mang to
ralph is greater than one

618
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,890 
is a growing exponential are below with
a magnitude about the

619
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,559 
is less than 1 its a decaying

620
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,469 
exponential are below and so I
demonstrated that here

621
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:24,160 
here we have the magnitude about the
greater than one

622
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,569 
and here we have the magnitude about the
less than 1

623
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,700 
in both cases sinusoidal sequences
underneath the envelope

624
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,140 
and then an envelope and is dictated

625
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,749 
by what the magnitude about its

626
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:42,769 
okay now in the discrete-time

627
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:47,150 
case then we have results similar to the
continuous-time case

628
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,309 
namely comp own it's a real or imaginary
part

629
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,980 
that have a real exponential factor
times

630
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,180 
a sinusoid of course

631
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,880 
if the magnitude of alpha is

632
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,079 
less than 1 I'm sorry the main to mouth
is equal to 1

633
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,190 
then this factor disappears

634
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,469 
always equal to one in this factor is
equal to 1

635
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:17,710 
and so we have sinusoids in both the
real and imaginary parts

636
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,180 
now one can ask whether

637
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,230 
in general the complex exponential

638
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,759 
with the magnitude about the equal to
one is periodically not periodic

639
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:31,930 
and a clue to that can be inferred

640
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,789 
by examining this expression

641
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:42,150 
in particular in the discrete-time case
with the magnitude about equal to 1

642
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,299 
we have pure sinusoids in the real

643
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,359 
part in an imaginary part

644
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,380 
and in fact in a continuous-time case
with are equal to 0

645
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,710 
we have sinusoids in the real party
imaginary part

646
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,690 
in a continuous-time case we have a pure
complex exponential

647
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,500 
in fact so that so the terms are
exponentially growing your DK

648
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:14,290 
back those exponentials are always
periodic because

649
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,920 
the course the real and imaginary
sinusoidal Cup on its superior

650
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,540 
in the discrete-time case we know that
the sinusoids may or may not be periodic

651
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,380 
depending on the bad you love Omega 0
and so in fact

652
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,810 
in the discrete-time case the
exponential

653
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,870 
eat to the J Omega 0n

654
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:40,340 
that i've indicated here may or may not
be periodic

655
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:47,250 
depending on what the value Omega zeros

656
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,200 
okay now to summarize

657
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,380 
in this lecture I introduced and
discussed

658
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,110 
a number of important basic signals

659
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,520 
in particular sinusoids an real

660
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,270 
and complex exponentials one of the
important outcomes

661
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,600 
the discussion emphasize further in the
text is that

662
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,990 
there are some very important
similarities between them

663
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,550 
but there are also some very important
differences

664
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,680 
and these differences will surface when
we exploit

665
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,740 
sinusoids and complex exponentials

666
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,400 
as basic building blocks for more
general continuous-time

667
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,500 
in discrete-time signals in the next
lecture

668
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,460 
what I'll discuss are some other very
important building blocks

669
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,680 
namely what are referred to as

670
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,880 
step signals an impulse signals and

671
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,290 
does together with the sinusoidal

672
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,480 
signals and exponentials as we've talked
about today

673
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,640 
will really form the cornerstone

674
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,660 
for essentially all love the signal and
system analysis

675
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,140 
there will be dealing with for the
remainder the course thank you
