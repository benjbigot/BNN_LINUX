the new the in this lecture we

13
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:60,559 
begin a discussion of the topic
modulation

14
00:00:60,559 --> 00:01:04,470 
which is among other things a very
important

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,869 
topic in practical terms for example it

16
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,890 
forms the cornerstone for many
communication systems

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,210 
and also as we'll see as these lectures
go along

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,320 
a particular for modulation referred to
as poss amplitude modulation and

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,160 
eventually

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,649 
impulse modulation or impose train
modulation

21
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:28,830 
forms a very important bridge between

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,009 
continuous-time signals in discrete-time
signals

23
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,020 
now in general terms

24
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,030 
what we mean when we refer to modulation
is the notion

25
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,200 
%uh using one signal to very

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,190 
a parameter up another signal for
example

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,289 
a sinusoidal signal has three parameters

28
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:56,649 
amplitude frequency and phase and we
could think for example

29
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,940 
love using one signal

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,459 
to very let's say the airport to up a
sinusoidal signal

31
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,270 
and what that leads to is an ocean which
will develop in some detail

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,349 
referred to as sinusoidal amplitude
modulation

33
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,569 
and would correspond to a

34
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,069 
sinusoidal signal refer to as the
carrier

35
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,660 
and its amplitude being buried on the
basis

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,230 
love another signal now

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,890 
alternatively we could think all burying
either the

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,970 
frequency or the phase a sinusoidal
signal

39
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,940 
again with another signal and with that
leads to is another very important

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,860 
notion

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,930 
which is referred to as sinusoidal

42
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,160 
frequency modulation where essentially

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,350 
it's the frequency up a sinusoid that's
changing

44
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,590 
depending on the signal that we're using

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,050 
to modulate this sinusoid now

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,170 
sign a soil amplitude frequency and
phase modulation

47
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,810 
are extremely important topics and ideas

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,700 
in the context ok communication systems
what are the reasons is dead if you want

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,819 
to transmit a signal let's say for
example a voice signal

50
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:21,850 
the voice signal that you're listening
to now if you try to transmit that over

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,000 
long distances because the frequencies
involved

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,720 
the medium that you use to transmitted

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,670 
won't carry it long distances the idea
then

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,260 
is to essentially take that signal like
a voice signal

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,370 
use it to modulate a much higher
frequency signal

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,670 
and then transmit that higher frequency
signal

57
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,260 
over a medium dead essentially can
support

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,280 
long-distance transmission at those
frequencies then at the other end of

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,819 
course

60
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,050 
the voice information or whatever else
the information is

61
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,610 
is taken off now also

62
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,610 
a notion that that leads to an will be
developing in

63
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,650 
some detail is kind of the idea that in
fact

64
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,390 
you can simultaneously transmit more
than one signal

65
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,760 
by in essence taking several voice
signals or other signals

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,639 
using them to modulate either the
frequency or amplitude

67
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,150 
love sinusoidal signals at different
frequencies

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,080 
ending all those together that's a
process called multiplexing

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,620 
and then at the other end the
transmission system

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,280 
taking those sinusoidal signals apart
and then

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,270 
extracting the envelope or frequency
modulation information

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,610 
to get back to the voice signal or other
information carrying signal

73
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,020 
so that's one of the very important ways
in which

74
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,659 
modulation is used sinusoidal modulation
is used in communication systems

75
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,669 
and and white will see as

76
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,909 
in particular as we go through today's
lecture

77
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:06,460 
is there'd amplitude modulation
sinusoidal amplitude modulation

78
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,669 
in fact follows in a fairly
straightforward way

79
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,840 
from the properties of the four EA
transform

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,909 
that we've developed in summer the
earlier lectures

81
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:20,210 
so our focus on in today's lecture

82
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,830 
will be on sinusoidal amplitude
modulation

83
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,539 
in continuous-time in the next lecture
will

84
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,779 
consider the same set of notions related
to discrete-time

85
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,039 
and also a concept referred to as poss
amplitude modulation

86
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,469 
and all of these follow very in a very
straightforward way from the modulation

87
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:43,490 
property for the 48 transform

88
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,990 
issues of frequency and phase modulation
are

89
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,379 
a little more difficult to analyze but
in fact many have

90
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,960 
the techniques that we've developed in
the previous lectures

91
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,990 
also provide important insights into
frequency phase modulation

92
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,309 
summer this is develop in more detail

93
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:05,740 
in the book so what I'd like to do

94
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,120 
is focus for now on the concept

95
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,539 
love amplitude modulation

96
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,650 
and in as i indicated

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,529 
there are several kinds love carrier
signals

98
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,449 
on which the modulation can be
superimposed

99
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,039 
the basic structure for an amplitude
modulation system

100
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,619 
is one in which there is the modulating
signal let's say for example Voice

101
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,520 
and a carrier signal what's referred to
as the carrier

102
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,629 
and then of course the resulting output
is the modulated output

103
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:47,330 
now to analyze this since we have
multiplication in the time domain

104
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,379 
we know from the property the 48
transform

105
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,749 
that we've developed previously the
modulation property

106
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,930 
dead multiplication in the time domain
corresponds to

107
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,629 
convolution in the frequency domain and
it's this basic property or equation

108
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,449 
dead lets us analyzed in some detail in
fact

109
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,580 
the notions of amplitude modulation

110
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,939 
as we go through this lecture and the
next lecture

111
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,889 
we'll be talking as i indicated about
several different types

112
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,279 
carrier signals one is

113
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,499 
what's referred to as poss carriers and
that leads to

114
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,229 
among other things the concept the pulse
amplitude modulation

115
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,099 
that will be deferred until the next
lecture

116
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,919 
in today's lecture what I'll focus on is

117
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,930 
first the case of a complex exponential
carrier

118
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,210 
second the case of a sinusoidal carrier

119
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,249 
and in fact in the complex exponential
carrier a sinusoidal carrier

120
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,569 
are obviously very closely related since

121
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,659 
the complex exponential carrier is in
effect

122
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,149 
to sinusoidal carriers one

123
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,960 
for the real part and one for the
imaginary part

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,169 
so let's first begin a discussion love

125
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,800 
amplitude modulation by considering a
complex exponential carrier

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,479 
and then moving on to a discussion of a
sinusoidal carrier

127
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,729 
so the issue then is dead

128
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,599 
we have a signal

129
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,050 
x50 it's multiplied by a carrier

130
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,990 
and the carrier they were considering is
a carrier signal

131
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,070 
see if the of the form

132
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,200 
e2 the J Omega CT

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,250 
plus status see thats the form

134
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,470 
love our carrier signal and

135
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,510 
what we can first analyze is what

136
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,529 
the result things signal or spectrum is

137
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,190 
at the output the modulator well we can
do that by

138
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,630 
concentrating on the modulation property

139
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,700 
and let's consider just are as a

140
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,329 
serb general for respect from what i've
indicated here

141
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,949 
for the 48 transform love

142
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:15,560 
the input signal

143
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,009 
or modulating signal exe phone maker and
so

144
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:22,430 
this is intended to represent

145
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,769 
the spectrum affect safety

146
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,430 
and then the carrier signal since it's a
single complex exponential

147
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,259 
has a $4 EA transform which is

148
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,290 
an impulse in the frequency domain

149
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,850 
and the airport to up the impulse is

150
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,899 
to partay to the J status subsea

151
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,529 
where we noticed that the complex
amplitude incorporates

152
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,690 
the phase information so

153
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,110 
now if we multiply in the time domain
week involving the frequency domain and

154
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,290 
as you know

155
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,089 
involving a signal with an impulse just
shifts that signal to the location of

156
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:03,420 
the impulse

157
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,380 
and so as a consequence and taken care
various

158
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,290 
factors what we end up with is spectrum

159
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,680 
then that is centered at the carrier
frequency

160
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279 
Omega subsea so

161
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,790 
what this says is dead if we have a
signal

162
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,940 
x50 and we

163
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,930 
use it to modulate a complex exponential
carrier

164
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,579 
in the frequency domain what we've
simply done is to take

165
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:38,959 
the original spectrum and shifted in
frequency

166
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,680 
to so that was originally at zero
frequency is now centered around the

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,300 
carrier frequency

168
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,220 
now we've now modulated in effect to a
higher frequency

169
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,899 
things are happening at a higher
frequency band and

170
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,920 
the next question is how do we do much
away or in other words

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,699 
how do we get the original signal back

172
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,199 
well of course one way that we can think
of doing it

173
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:08,209 
particularly in the context love this

174
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,110 
specific carrier if we look back at the
top equation

175
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,550 
we have as the result in the modulation

176
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,449 
X 50 time see if he were see if t is
this

177
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,750 
and we could consider for example

178
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,550 
just simply dividing the modulator
output by this

179
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,629 
or equivalently taking the modulated
output

180
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,850 
and multiplying by the to the

181
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,850 
minus J Omega CT plus they to see

182
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,790 
well let's track that through in terms
of the spectra

183
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,350 
we have again the spectrum or

184
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,940 
the output the modulator which is the
original spectrum shifted

185
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,310 
up to the carrier frequency we have

186
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,319 
below that the spectrum love

187
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:01,050 
e2 the minus J Omega CT plus they to see

188
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,009 
and if we now convolved this with this

189
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,959 
that results in simply shifting this
spectrum except for

190
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,519 
an issue the scale factor shifting this
spectrum

191
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,399 
back down to the origin so can bombing
these two together

192
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,660 
the spectrum that we end up with is that

193
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,370 
so weekend track this through in the
frequency domain

194
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,899 
in the frequency domain that says ship
the spectrum up

195
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,410 
when you want the modulate ship the
spectrum back down

196
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,560 
and alternatively we can look at
algebraically

197
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,750 
in the time domain what it says is if
you multiply it by either the plush

198
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,420 
chair make a CT

199
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,910 
then when you want to get back multiply
by in the minus chair make a CT

200
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,399 
now one question that I you could
conceivably be asking is

201
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,689 
if we're talking about practical systems
and not

202
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,250 
simply mathematics in fact

203
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,149 
doesn't make sense in the real world to
consider

204
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,500 
using a complex exponential carrier

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,279 
and the answer to that in fact is

206
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,740 
yes dead very often in practical systems
one considers

207
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,649 
using a carrier which in fact is a
complex exponential

208
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,709 
well a complex exponentials complex
there's a

209
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,540 
square root of -1 in the air and you can
kinda basse-bolle how do we get a square

210
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,170 
root of -1

211
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,430 
and the answer is fairly simple let's

212
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,019 
look again at the modulator which we
have here

213
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,879 
and in effect with that says is we want
to multiply

214
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,850 
a real-valued signal by you the chair
make a CT plus they to see

215
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,250 
now we can equivalent Lee use oil as
relationship

216
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,610 
to break this down into a cosine and
sine term

217
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,069 
and so what that means interns have an
implementation equivalent Lee

218
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:03,439 
is modulating x50

219
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,120 
onto a cosine carrier

220
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,589 
and that then gives us the real part

221
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:14,810 
ald the complex output and modulating it
onto

222
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,300 
a sinusoidal carrier these two being
ninety degrees out of phase

223
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,509 
and that gives us the imaginary part

224
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,019 
and so in effect this is the complex
signal

225
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:31,230 
if we just simply think both hanging
attack on here that says square root of

226
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,970 
-1 RJ

227
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,579 
and we appropriately combined complex
signals

228
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,800 
following the rules of complex
arithmetic and indeed that's exactly the

229
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,999 
way things are done in the real world

230
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,389 
a complex signal is simply a set love

231
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,040 
to real signals and of course if we look
at the spectra

232
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,509 
involved if we we have here the real
part and the imaginary part pov

233
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,240 
the complex output if we

234
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,339 
again refer back to the original
spectrum accessible maker

235
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,829 
and the modulated spectrum

236
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,879 
which I show down here the original
spectrum

237
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,040 
shifted up to the carrier frequency

238
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,620 
in effect we're building nests I dove
two lines

239
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,050 
one-line representing the real part

240
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,980 
love that and the real part in the time
domain corresponds to the even part in

241
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,300 
the frequency domain

242
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,870 
and so with the output of one of the

243
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,749 
Cosi if the cosine modulator we have a
spectrum

244
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,889 
that looks like this and

245
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:46,769 
the output love the along the imaginary
branch

246
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,269 
has a spectrum that looks like this

247
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:53,519 
recalling the top branch that this

248
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,999 
for positive frequencies is positive and
was positive here and so in effect when

249
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,180 
you add them

250
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,490 
this portion of the spectrum will cancel
out

251
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,430 
so in effect what we're doing is
building

252
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,709 
then the complex signal

253
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:14,269 
in effect outta to real signals or we're
building this complex

254
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,040 
the spectrum the complex signal I dove
separate lines the represent the

255
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,949 
even and the art parts

256
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,559 
okay now their

257
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,920 
are lots of applications love amplitude
modulation

258
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,430 
and we'll be seeing a number of these as
we go through the discussion

259
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,860 
what I'd like to do in is just indicate
briefly

260
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,889 
one now which is an application that

261
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,559 
are in fact surface is fairly often in
the context

262
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,509 
love a complex exponential carrier

263
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,029 
and bad is the notion love using
modulation

264
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,970 
to permit

265
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,110 
the application %uh love

266
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,959 
a very well designed and implemented
low-pass filter

267
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,309 
to be used as a bandpass filter and in
fact as a set a bandpass filters

268
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,770 
account here's the idea the idea is

269
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,230 
if we have a fixed filter

270
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,959 
work we have let's say we have a signal
and we want to thank

271
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,540 
all a filter which we want to kinda move
along the signal

272
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,970 
one way to do it is to somehow have
filters the move along the signal

273
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,730 
the other possibility is to keep the
filter fix and let

274
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,120 
the signal move in frequency in front of
the filter

275
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,550 
let me that may be a little more
specific

276
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,850 
suppose that we have a signal accept T

277
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,570 
and in we modulated with a complex
exponential carrier

278
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,180 
with the carrier frequency Omega see

279
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,860 
and the output if that is then processed
with a low pass filter

280
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,880 
and then we d modulate the result

281
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,040 
then in fact what we've done is to take
the spectrum

282
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,300 
or the input signal

283
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,770 
shifted pullout what is now around low
frequencies

284
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,140 
and then shift that part of the spectrum
back to where it belongs

285
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,690 
so if we look at that interns

286
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,470 
over actually tracking through the
spectra we would have

287
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,350 
initially a spectrum for the original
signal

288
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,590 
which I show at the top as excessive
Omega

289
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,960 
after modulating or shifting that
spectrum

290
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,970 
up to a center frequency Omega see

291
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,290 
we then have what I indicate here and
the dotted line corresponds to

292
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,390 
the passband the low-caste filter

293
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,770 
well the results have low pass filtering
rejects

294
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,980 
all the spectrum except the part around
low frequencies

295
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,800 
and the next step is then 2d modulate

296
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,690 
this and so in effect the modulating

297
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,500 
will shift this spectrum back to where
it originally came from

298
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,740 
and so that result will be what I

299
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,200 
show in the final result

300
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,780 
which is here and what we can say is
that

301
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,980 
this in fact is equivalent

302
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,550 
if we can look back at the top spectrum

303
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,370 
this is equivalent to having extracted

304
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,870 
with a bandpass filter a section out of
this part of the spectrum

305
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,720 
so interns love tracking through the
spectrum and looking at

306
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,390 
the equivalent filtering operation

307
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,070 
then what we accomplished was

308
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,470 
to pull out this part of the spectrum

309
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,610 
using a low-pass filter and modulation

310
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,010 
but acquittal atlee what we implemented
was

311
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,750 
a bandpass filter as i indicate here

312
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,930 
now of course a signal with this
spectrum since

313
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,490 
this spectrum is not kind you get
symmetric we know that this signal does

314
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,290 
not correspond to a real-valued signal

315
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,170 
a quite lovely this filter doesn't
correspond to a filter whose impulse

316
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,590 
response Israel

317
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,390 
if in fact we add another step to this

318
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,580 
which is to take the real part of the
output

319
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,220 
then by taking the real part of the
output we would be taking the

320
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,800 
even part of the spectrum associated
with that complex signal

321
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,100 
and the acquittal with author that we
would end up with then

322
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,270 
is the filter that I indicated the
bottom

323
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,950 
which is a bandpass filter

324
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,760 
now just two reiterate a point that I
made earlier

325
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,670 
a question of course is why would you go
to this trouble why not just build a

326
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,560 
bandpass filter

327
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,430 
and one other reasons is that

328
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,100 
its often much easier to build

329
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,970 
affixed filter a filter with a fixed
center frequency for example a low-pass

330
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,900 
filter

331
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,330 
than it is to build the filter that has
variable compliments in it so that

332
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,240 
when you bury them the filters center
frequency shifts around

333
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,670 
now if you want to look at at the energy
and a signaling different frequency

334
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,600 
bands

335
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,660 
then you'd like to look at it through
different filters

336
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,850 
and so kind of the idea here which is
really the basis for many spectrum

337
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,270 
analyzers

338
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,330 
is to build a really good quality
low-pass filter

339
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,500 
and then use modulation which is often
easier to implement use modulation

340
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,960 
to shift the signal essentially in front
of the wind

341
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,370 
in front of the filter

342
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,600 
okay well so we've can work their way
through

343
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,500 
modulation with a complex exponential
carrier

344
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,730 
and what we saw

345
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,860 
among other things with a complex
exponential carrier

346
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,950 
is that in fact what a car sponse to

347
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,980 
is to

348
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,480 
branches one being modulation

349
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,570 
with a cosine and the other modulation
with the sign

350
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,340 
and so in fact in the real world weren't
there in a practical system

351
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,870 
modulation the complex exponential
carrier really would be accomplished

352
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,860 
with modulation with the sinusoidal
carrier

353
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,920 
and in particular with sinusoidal
carriers

354
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,140 
that are in quadrature as its referred
to or

355
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,880 
covertly ninety degrees out of phase

356
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,450 
okay well you in fact

357
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,600 
sinusoidal modulation in other words
modulation using only a sinusoidal

358
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,550 
carrier

359
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,450 
very often is used in its own right

360
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,590 
not only for for generating a complex
exponential carrier

361
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,570 
but in fact as a carrier by itself

362
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,680 
well let's looking at what the
consequences

363
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,610 
love modulation with a sinus or to carry
or R and a particular

364
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,830 
work through again what the specter are

365
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,400 
and how we get the original signal back
again

366
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,040 
soul in we are talking then about a
carrier signal

367
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,920 
which is simply a sinusoidal signal

368
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,820 
with some phase and of course we can

369
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,160 
right that as the some love too complex
exponential

370
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,630 
signals and so in effect now

371
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,970 
when we apply the modulation property we
have the original spectrum

372
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,190 
which a show here accessible maker

373
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,050 
and that's convolved with the spectrum
love the carrier

374
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,220 
and the spectrum of the carrier in this
case

375
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,530 
is two impulses one at

376
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,170 
plus Omega see and one at minus Omega
see

377
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,530 
and the amplitudes if these incorporate
the phase

378
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,930 
and later on in the lectured and

379
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,360 
and to and subsequent lectures all

380
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,730 
have a tendency to drop that they
deserve see just

381
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,210 
to keep the notation an algebra little
cleaner but

382
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,380 
for now I've incorporated and so now

383
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,490 
when we apply the modulation property
what

384
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,390 
we will do is convolved this spectrum

385
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,540 
with this spectrum and the result of
course

386
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,920 
is that the spectrum of the original
signal

387
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,040 
gets replicated at both Omega since the

388
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,100 
and at minus Omega subsea and

389
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,310 
the resulting spectrum at the output to
the modulator then

390
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,640 
is the spectrum that I show here

391
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,610 
okay well now the question of course is

392
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,190 
see now what's happened is there with a
sinus or carrier we've moved

393
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,310 
the spectrum to both plus i'll make a CD
and minus Omega see

394
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,760 
and now if we want to get the original
signal back again

395
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,530 
well we would like to do somehow is move
that spectrum back down

396
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,890 
to the origin now in the case for
complex exponential

397
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,930 
that was easy to do which shifted one of
which is shifted back down

398
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,440 
let's see what happens if in fact we
attempt 2d modulate

399
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,920 
by again multiplying by the same
sinusoidal carrier

400
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,960 
so let's examine what happens if

401
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,730 
we now take

402
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,460 
are modulated signal

403
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,060 
and again modulated

404
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,460 
onto the same sinusoidal carrier

405
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,480 
to generate the output WT if we look at
the spectra

406
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,720 
we have then the

407
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,950 
modulated spectrum which we had
initially

408
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,030 
and we now want to convey all that again
with the spectrum

409
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,130 
or the carrier signal the specter the
carrier signal

410
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,250 
I indicate here and if you tracked
through the convolution which is fairly

411
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,590 
straightforward

412
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,600 
then in fact what happens as you can
follow this with this

413
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,620 
is you end up with

414
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,610 
a composite spectrum which

415
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,950 
is what i've indicated on the bottom
curve and has

416
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,350 
in effect the spectrum of the original
single exit see

417
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,820 
replicated in three places one

418
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,610 
is at -2 Omega subsea

419
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,220 
one is around the origin and wanna
shifted up to

420
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,460 
twice the carrier frequency well

421
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,610 
it's this piece that we want if we could
eliminate everything else

422
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,510 
and keep this then that would in fact
correspond to the spectrum

423
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,030 
love the signal dead the original signal
exit T

424
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,160 
how do we do that well we know how

425
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,200 
to eliminate part of the spectrum and
keep another part of the spectrum that's

426
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,130 
called filtering so in fact what we
would do

427
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,330 
is put the result if this

428
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,420 
through a low-pass filter low-pass
filter route would retain the part of

429
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,170 
the spectrum

430
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,890 
around DC and eliminate the

431
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,200 
remaining part of the spectrum so we
would keep this part

432
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,430 
and eliminate the part of the spectrum
that we have over here

433
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,440 
and let me just draw your attention to
the fact that because of the way the

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,180 
algebra works out

435
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,630 
the amplitude love this replication the
spectrum is half with the original

436
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,160 
spectrum was and that means dead

437
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,510 
ideally to keep scale factors correct we
would choose the amplitude this

438
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,880 
to be to to scale this

439
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,820 
backup 21 okay so

440
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,740 
what we have is the modulator and
demodulator

441
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,040 
and just to summarize

442
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,180 
for the case Ave sinusoidal

443
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,450 
carrier as opposed to a complex
exponential carrier

444
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,800 
the modulator is just as it is in the
complex exponential case

445
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,950 
its multiplication with the sinusoidal
carrier

446
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,910 
with frequency Omega see if a status

447
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,660 
see in the d modulator

448
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,660 
in the D modulator we would take the
modulated signal

449
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,370 
modulated again with the same carrier
signal and as we'll see later

450
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,120 
it's important to keep the same face
relationship

451
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,850 
this result is now not yet quite

452
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,490 
that the modulated signal we need to
process that

453
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,660 
with a low-pass filter that extracts the
part of the spectrum

454
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,490 
around DC and throws away the upper part
of the spectrum the case generated in

455
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,620 
the second modulation process and the
resulting output

456
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,680 
is the original signal

457
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,990 
accept T right now

458
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,500 
what we've done is we've taken X 50
we've

459
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,350 
modulated it onto a carrier and then
we've taken a modulated signal and we

460
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,070 
figured out how to get back except Ian
of course

461
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,660 
one Caswell if you start with exiting
you want to get X thirty back again

462
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,480 
white by the going through all that why
not just use exit see the beginning at

463
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240 
the end and obviously

464
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,880 
their are lots of reasons as i indicated
before

465
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,070 
and just two reiterate what they are

466
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,640 
the notion of an is that what you'd like
to do

467
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,980 
is shift the signal into a different
frequency band

468
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,210 
for transmission over some medium day

469
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,550 
is more match to that frequency band

470
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,110 
then the frequency range the original
signal also

471
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,350 
as I alluded to there's the notion that
you can take lotsa signals

472
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,920 
and transmit them simultaneously over
one

473
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,700 
channel whether the channels a wire a
mic wave like a satellite link or

474
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,670 
whatever

475
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,070 
again using the idea of modulation

476
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,290 
and what that process is referred to

477
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,040 
as is multiplexing and let me just
quickly indicate what

478
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,440 
that multiplexing process corresponds to

479
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,070 
we could think for example love taking

480
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,770 
the taking one signal

481
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:05,300 
and modulating it on to one carrier

482
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,930 
with one carrier frequency taking

483
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,110 
a second signal modulating it onto a
different carrier frequency

484
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,630 
taking a third signal and modulating it

485
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,960 
onto a third carrier frequency et cetera

486
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,110 
and if we choose these carrier
frequencies

487
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:30,390 
appropriately then in fact weekend and
all those together

488
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,560 
and do it in such a way that the specter
don't overlap

489
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,720 
an end up with one broader band signal

490
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,120 
that incorporates the information

491
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,550 
simultaneously in all of those

492
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:49,830 
signals so just to illustrate that in
the frequency domain

493
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,880 
what we have let's say RR three spectra
xaxa

494
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,700 
the Annex E and we would for example
take

495
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,970 
this spectrum and modulated

496
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,840 
to a carrier frequency Omega sed est

497
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,050 
we can take this spectrum and modulate
it to a carrier frequency Omega sabi

498
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,480 
where Omega sabi is chosen so that

499
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,690 
when we and these two together they
don't overlap

500
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,780 
so that they can eventually be separated
out and then of course we can do the

501
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,700 
same thing

502
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,310 
with the third signal and put that in a
frequency range over here

503
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,350 
be careful that none of those overlap

504
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,140 
and lonely and all those together the
composite spectrum

505
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,730 
is what I show here and

506
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,620 
as you can see essentially

507
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,540 
by doing appropriate bandpass filtering

508
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,090 
we can pull at whatever part of the
spectrum we choose to

509
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,110 
and then d modulate that in the
appropriate way

510
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,010 
of course we can do this not just with
three signals but perhaps with

511
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,080 
tens or hundreds of signals so that's a
process

512
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,250 
dead is typically referred to as
multiplexing and as i've described here

513
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,400 
it's referred to as frequency division
multiplexing

514
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,930 
that is dividing the frequency band into
cells and plucking

515
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,580 
different signals into each one of those

516
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,700 
and in so if we want now to recover one
of those channels

517
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,940 
in a frequency division multiplexing
system

518
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,050 
as i indicated we would first d
multiplex

519
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,620 
the multiplexing corresponding to
pulling out

520
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,030 
the appropriate channel with a bandpass
filter

521
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,740 
and after D multiplexing we would then

522
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,460 
d modulate and we would be modulated

523
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,360 
with the carrier appropriate to the
channel that we've pulled out

524
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,810 
and the the modulation of course

525
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,500 
involves multiplying by the carrier and
doing appropriate

526
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,530 
low-pass filtering to finally get the
signal back

527
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,890 
and frequency division multiplexing

528
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,919 
is one of those things that is

529
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,800 
are its it's a fact which uses the
typeof multiplexing issues for example

530
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,520 
in typical broadcast a.m.

531
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,210 
radio systems where all the channels are
superimposed

532
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,210 
together and it's your home radio
receiver that does the appropriate the

533
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,760 
multiplexing in the modulating

534
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,819 
and of course you can see that not only
is modulation an important part

535
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:38,480 
of that but as I alluded to in the last
lecture filtering

536
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,470 
also becomes an important part love
these practical systems

537
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,200 
okay now the kinda amplitude modulation

538
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,270 
that i've talked about so far

539
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,350 
is what's referred to as

540
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,840 
synchronous modulation and

541
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,320 
the reason for the term synchronous is
dead in fact

542
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,430 
what's implied in the system's

543
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,270 
is a synchronization between

544
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,410 
the transmitter and receiver in
particular

545
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,660 
in the system as we've talked about it

546
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,720 
the modulator

547
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,060 
and the D modulator

548
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,750 
have a synchronization in

549
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,670 
both frequency and phase the face here
is indicated status if C

550
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,180 
and if we take a look at the D modulator

551
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,480 
the the modulator has a

552
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,910 
phase love status subsea

553
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,360 
and in general

554
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,330 
there's the issue love whether we cannot
maintain that synchronization between

555
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,850 
the modulator and demodulator

556
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,050 
and so what we want to examine now

557
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,880 
more generally is what the consequences
might be

558
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,950 
and the solution to the resulting
problems

559
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,340 
if in fact we don't have synchronization

560
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,390 
between the modulator and demodulator

561
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,800 
synchronization in terms of phase and

562
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,090 
they're also by the way is another
problem which is the issue

563
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,010 
synchronization

564
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,200 
in frequency thats examine more in

565
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,480 
the text and one of focus on here is
just the issue synchronization it face

566
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,710 
to give you some sense of

567
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,940 
what the issue is okay well

568
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,800 
so now what we want to look at is what
happens if we have a modulator

569
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,100 
with face status at sea

570
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,230 
and it D modulator where the phase
instead if a is

571
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,500 
said being status if C is some other
phase

572
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,500 
the subsea and if you tracked through
the details and the algebra

573
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:02,010 
then what you'll find is dead in fact
the output love the low-pass filter

574
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,470 
rather than being XFT the signal that we
want

575
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,670 
is X if T multiplied by a scale factor

576
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,790 
and the scale factor is the cosigner the
phase difference

577
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,810 
now one can ask okay well what's the big
deal about

578
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,200 
a scale factor if it's too small will
make it bigger purse to be will make it

579
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,590 
small

580
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,420 
but there's several points 1 is notice
for example that if the phase difference

581
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,360 
between

582
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,760 
much later and the modulator is 90
degrees

583
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,900 
then in fact the output at the modulator
0

584
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,600 
or if it isn't quite ninety degrees the
amplitude might be small

585
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,890 
and the implication would be a that if
there's other noise that gets injected

586
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,130 
in the system

587
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,240 
the signal to noise ratio is very low
now even worse

588
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,210 
is the issue that if

589
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,170 
in fact there's a phase difference but
the exact phase differences and

590
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,400 
maintained

591
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,540 
so that the modulator and demodulator
kinda fade in and out of phase

592
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,460 
then in fact the output at the modulator

593
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,600 
is x50 multiplied

594
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,500 
by a time-varying fading term which is
the cosigner the phase difference

595
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,770 
well what that means essentially is dead

596
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:25,400 
if you use this kind of system to do
that the modulation

597
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,040 
then in fact what you need to be careful
about is

598
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,450 
maintaining synchronization in phase and
also is it turns out a frequency between

599
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:39,390 
the modulator and demodulator

600
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,220 
now there are alternatives to this

601
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,160 
and the alternative is what's referred
to as

602
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,260 
a synchronous the modulation and

603
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,550 
let me indicate what the idea behind a
synchronous

604
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,750 
the modulation is

605
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,200 
now recall the what we've done in
amplitude modulation

606
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,640 
is to take the carrier signal and very
its ample to

607
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,060 
with the signal that eventually we want
to get back

608
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,280 
so if we look at the amplitude modulated
waveform it might

609
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,880 
typically look as i indicated here

610
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,250 
and what we're trying to get back is
we're trying to get back

611
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,670 
the envelope well one could imagine

612
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,980 
building a circuit or designing a device
which in some sense will

613
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,230 
tracked the envelope and in fact a

614
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,540 
common circuit to do that is a fairly
simple

615
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,720 
circuit consisting love a diode

616
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,940 
and a resistor and capacitor in parallel

617
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,480 
kinda the idea being that the capacitor
charges up

618
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,940 
as this way for moves up to its p

619
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,970 
and then as the way for drops down the
capacitor discharges through the

620
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,500 
resistor and

621
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,610 
it kinda tracks the envelope in fact the
kinda output

622
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,780 
that we would get is the type of
behavior that

623
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,830 
i've indicated here and in fact than
that is

624
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,100 
a type all the modulation it

625
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,250 
it's the modulation that doesn't require
synchronization between

626
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,360 
the modulator and demodulator and

627
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,380 
it's fairly inexpensive to build

628
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,590 
but it has obviously some

629
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,710 
trade-offs associated with it well

630
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:36,560 
to can indicate where the trade-off
comes from or where the issue surfaces

631
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,130 
notice the what we're doing is tracking

632
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,430 
the envelope with the sinusoidal signal

633
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,150 
and we're calling mad or we're suing the
back is our regional

634
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,390 
signal exit T

635
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:54,119 
well suppose that XFT

636
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,050 
the original signal is sometimes
positive and sometimes negative

637
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,110 
what might we see as we look

638
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:07,490 
at the output out the modulator well the
output at the modulator would've course

639
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,660 
follow the envelope down and

640
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,940 
then it would follow the envelope back
up again

641
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,010 
in other words what would tend to
generate is

642
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,330 
a full-wave rectified version all the
signal that you were really trying to

643
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,610 
get back

644
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,119 
now there's a simple solution to this
the simple solution

645
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,290 
is to make sure that the signal

646
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,360 
that is the modulating signal XFT

647
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,690 
never goes negative so if it happens to

648
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,790 
voice signal happens tends to go
negative that happens to

649
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,970 
we can simply at a constant to it and
and a

650
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,710 
watchin of constant so that it always
stays positive

651
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,910 
well let's look at that in the

652
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:55,570 
what we want to do then if we're
considering a synchronous the modulation

653
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:01,880 
is to take our original signal x50

654
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,960 
and and to it a constant

655
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,280 
where the constant is made large enough
so they were sure

656
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,310 
that this is a positive signal

657
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,200 
and it's a really let me just draw your
attention to the fact that I'm now

658
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,720 
suppressing

659
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,160 
the phase on the carrier signal since

660
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,080 
the phase is not important to the
argument and it's just some additional

661
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,310 
notation to carry around

662
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,040 
now so the the idea then is an a
constant exit see

663
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,990 
notice that if we just take this term
and expanded out into two terms

664
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:43,730 
accept a cosigner Omega CT plus eight
times cosine Omega CT

665
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:50,430 
then in block diagram terms we can we
can represent that as i've shown here

666
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,600 
and so it would correspond to modulating
the signal

667
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,740 
accept T onto the carrier Omega some CT

668
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,420 
and also injecting some carrier

669
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,270 
with an amplitude a and the output at
the modulator is then the summer those

670
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,920 
two

671
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,060 
and the tech depending on exactly what
this value a is

672
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,650 
will influence what the envelope a look
like

673
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,130 
and I indicate below to possibilities

674
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,910 
one is where I'd made a fairly large

675
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,320 
and one is where I've made a
significantly smaller

676
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,990 
and their are both positive and negative
issues associated with whether a is too

677
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,850 
large a raise too small

678
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,230 
for example if a is small

679
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,070 
in relation to the amplitude

680
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:49,400 
love the signal then %uh rather pay is
large in relation to the airport to the

681
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,510 
signal

682
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,890 
then this envelope tends to be very flat
and it tends to be easy to track it with

683
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,500 
that simple diode RC circuit

684
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,450 
as compared with the case down here

685
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,010 
on the other hand their is a price that
you pay

686
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:13,330 
for this kind event below and the price
that you pay is perhaps best seen in the

687
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,730 
frequency domain

688
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,130 
if we look in the frequency domain here

689
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,590 
is our original spectrum

690
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,730 
here is the spectrum at the output

691
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,050 
%uh the modulator and the impulse that
occurs here

692
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,510 
corresponds to the carrier this injected

693
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,520 
the larger a is the more carrier is
injected

694
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,570 
the more carrier thats injected

695
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,770 
the easier it is for the envelope
detector

696
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,910 
2d modulate so

697
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,040 
one can ask well why not just put a lot
in well

698
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,920 
the obvious answer is dead

699
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,130 
it's not and information carrying part
but the signal

700
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,970 
and so in some sense it represents
inefficiency in transmission because

701
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,820 
what you're transmitting is power energy

702
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,480 
that doesn't have any information
associated with it is simply the

703
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,410 
injection of a carrier

704
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,850 
to make d modulation for a

705
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,430 
an AC Christie modulator the modulator
to make

706
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,630 
the the modulation easier

707
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,850 
and so there's this trade off and in
fact one

708
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,210 
kinda represents the trade-off and the
Pratt Associated primers very often

709
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,610 
returns a percent modulation

710
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,020 
where the percent modulation is

711
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,890 
a the essentially the ratio the maximum
signal level

712
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,369 
to the amplitude love the injected
carrier

713
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:51,000 
and depending on whether

714
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,550 
the modulations very high or very low
the trade-off

715
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:59,470 
is dead the transmission is more
efficient and it takes more energy but

716
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,200 
the modulator is simpler

717
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,820 
or the modulators more complicated but

718
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,450 
the transmission is simply now there are
situations where you might very well

719
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,490 
want to use one or the other for example

720
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,780 
in home radio your

721
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,830 
of unwilling to transmit a lot of power

722
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:24,080 
so that you can have inexpensive
consumer-oriented receivers

723
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,400 
on the other hand in satellite
communication you willing

724
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,430 
to pay a very high price for the
modulators and D modulators

725
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,480 
but its the amount of power that's
transmitted

726
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,090 
that's at a premium and so in one case
satellite communication you use

727
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,680 
synchronous modulation and demodulation
where isn't typical consumer-oriented

728
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,490 
broadcasting

729
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,010 
you would use a sink in a synchronous
system and

730
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,110 
Jenna and transmit more power even

731
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:58,119 
transfer more power even if it's
inefficient so that the D modulator

732
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,140 
can be simply now

733
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,340 
in a synchronous system then as we've
indicated there's one source of

734
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,910 
inefficiency which

735
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,790 
is this injection at the Carrier there
also

736
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,869 
is a somewhat different issue

737
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:21,150 
related to inefficiency in sinusoidal
amplitude modulation

738
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,450 
and its inefficiency that is

739
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,970 
separate from the issue synchronous
first is a synchronous systems in other

740
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,160 
words it's not associated with

741
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,400 
the injection of the carrier its a very
different issue

742
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,190 
let me indicate what that is let's look
again

743
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,360 
in at the spectrum love

744
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,970 
X 50 which i've indicated here

745
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,350 
and in a sinusoidal amplitude modulation
system

746
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,290 
we would shift this to

747
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,609 
are centered around plus and minus the
carrier frequency

748
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,609 
now notice there in the original system
we

749
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:06,920 
occupier frequency spectrum thats two
times Omega Savannah M

750
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,180 
by the time we've shifted it we've used
up

751
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,230 
thinking a positive and negative
frequencies we've used up

752
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,050 
twice as much all the frequency spectrum

753
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,980 
well you could say okay let's let's just
shift this up this way and

754
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,859 
get rid of this part that's of course
what the complex exponential carrier did

755
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:31,890 
and the issue there really is that now
you've got to transmit both the real

756
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,090 
part an imaginary part

757
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:38,330 
so what you can think about and ask is

758
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,920 
if you still want to transmit a
real-valued signal

759
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,330 
happen you somehow remove the
inefficiency or redundancy in the

760
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,540 
spectrum

761
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,710 
well notice that what we have is

762
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,060 
this spectrum moved here and moved here

763
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,119 
and we could imagine building a

764
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,190 
real-valued signal by

765
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:06,580 
eliminating what I refer to here as the
lower sideband

766
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,420 
I have the positive frequencies and the
lower sideband

767
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,710 
otto's the negative frequencies

768
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,590 
and in effect what we've done is taken

769
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,060 
just the positive frequencies here
shifted them there

770
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,060 
the negative frequencies here and
shifted them here and the resulting

771
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,859 
spectrum

772
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,980 
is what I indicate below

773
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,840 
well this in fact is what is often done

774
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,020 
and what is referred to as is single
sideband

775
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,050 
what we've done is we've kept the upper
sideband

776
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,330 
in this particular case we could
alternatively by the way

777
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,480 
think love putting this system together

778
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,000 
where we retain the lower

779
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,250 
sideband instead of the upper sideband

780
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,810 
and in either case well we removed is

781
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:01,690 
and inefficiency in transmission at the
signal

782
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,950 
namely we have a real value signal but
it only requires as much

783
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,600 
total band with the terms thereof the
frequencies that I

784
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,950 
that in which there's energy president
as

785
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,930 
the original sick well how do we do this
there are a variety of ways

786
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,270 
in and there's one procedure that is

787
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,520 
discussed in more detail in the text
which uses was referred to as a

788
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,630 
90-degree face splitter

789
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,150 
the simplest way at least conceptually
is to think about doing it with

790
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,740 
filtering and the idea simply

791
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,790 
is dead if we have are modulated signal

792
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,560 
here's the spektr on the modulated
signal and if that modulated signal is

793
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,720 
simply put through

794
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,359 
a high pass filter than the result

795
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,740 
will be to eliminate

796
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,140 
the lower sideband if we choose the
high-pass filter

797
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,550 
to have a characteristic as I indicate
here

798
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:03,800 
so this course conceptually is a very
sharp cutoff filter

799
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,380 
and what it eliminates are the lower
side bands and the resulting spectrum

800
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,800 
is what we have below

801
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,000 
and this in fact is really kind of the
basic idea

802
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,100 
behind single sideband transmission

803
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,290 
again there's a trade-off it's clearly
more efficient

804
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:28,210 
then double sideband transmission

805
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,830 
but also has the complication

806
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:36,130 
or additional issue dead the modulator
becomes a little more complicated

807
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,630 
because you need

808
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:41,850 
this filtering operation or some
equivalent operation to get rid of the

809
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:46,180 
unwanted side

810
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,520 
okay well this is a fairly quick

811
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,020 
tour through a variety of issues related
to modulation

812
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,130 
and it really is just the tip of the
iceberg obviously

813
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,320 
modulation in the context so sinusoidal

814
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,910 
modulation as we talked about has

815
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,030 
in fact the lotto detailed issues
associated with it

816
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,700 
it's important to recognize day at

817
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,840 
and to be somewhat pleased by the fact
dead

818
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,680 
not only with the mathematical
foundations that we've developed

819
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,840 
can we understand the basics of
sinusoidal amplitude modulation but in

820
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,609 
fact

821
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:30,050 
what you'll find issue if you

822
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,440 
dig into this somewhat deeper that the
basic background that we've built up so

823
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,920 
far

824
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,320 
the mathematical tools are really

825
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,140 
pretty much what you need for a much
deeper understanding

826
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,200 
love all the issues involved

827
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,660 
so from a what might have seemed like a
fairly abstract mathematical property

828
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,240 
associated with the Fourier transform
we've begun

829
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,359 
to develop what should give you the
sense that some

830
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,000 
important practical considerations

831
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,740 
and as we'll see in the next lecture

832
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,520 
very much the same kinds of notions
apply a

833
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,760 
for discrete-time sinus oil on complex
exponential

834
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,780 
amplitude modulation and also as i
indicated at the beginning at the

835
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,940 
lecture

836
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:28,130 
in the next lecture will also talk about
what's referred to as possible to

837
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,720 
modulation it's a different kind of
carrier

838
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,180 
and what that will lead to among other
things

839
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,640 
is a very important bridge

840
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,500 
between the notions of continuous-time

841
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,369 
and the notions of discrete-time thank
you
