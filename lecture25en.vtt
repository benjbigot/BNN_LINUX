during the course we've developed a number

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
love very powerful and useful tools and we've seen how

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
these can be used in designing and analyzing systems for example for

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
filtering for modulation et cetera

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'd like to conclude this

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
series of lectures with an introduction to one more

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
important topic namely the

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
analysis love feedback systems and

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
what are the principal reasons that we have left

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this discussion to the last part of the cores is so that we can exploit

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
some of the ideas that we've just developed in

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
summer the previous lectures namely the tools afforded us by

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
applause NZ transforms now

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
as I had indicated in one of the

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
very first lectures a common example

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
a feedback system is the problem love let's say

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
balancing a broom or in the case if that lecture balancing

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
my son's force on in the palm of your hand

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and kinda the idea there is dead

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
what that relies on in order to

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
make that a stable system is feedback in that particular case visual feedback

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that specific problem the one about saying something let's say in the palm

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
of your hand

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is an example love a problem which is commonly referred to as

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
inverted pendulum and it's one that we will actually be analyzing

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in a fair manner detailed not in this lecture but in the next lecture

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but let me just kinda vindicate what so the issues

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
are let me describe this into context not over balancing a broom on your hand

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
but

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
let's say that we have a mechanical system which consists of a card

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and the card can move let's say in one dimension

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and it has mounted on it

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a bar a ride with the weight on the top

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and it pivots around the base so that essentially represents the

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
inverted pendulum so that system can be

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
more or less depicted as i've indicated here and this is the cart

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that can move along the x-axis and

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
here we have a pivot point a ride await at the top

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and then of course there's several forces acting on this and

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
their is an acceleration that can be applied to the cart:

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and that will be thought a as the external input

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and then on the pendulum itself on the wait

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
there is the force of gravity and

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
then typically said if external disturbances that might

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
represent for example air currents or wind or whatever

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
dead will attempt to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Dez to destabilize the system specifically

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to have the pendulum fall down now

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
if we look at this system in more or less

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
a straightforward way what we have then

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are the system dynamics and

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
several inputs one of which is the external disturbances

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and the second is the acceleration which is

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the external acceleration is supplied and the app for the system can be

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
thought I love

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
as the angular displacement love the pendulum which

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
if we want a balanced we would like that angular displacement to be equal to 0

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
now if we know exactly what the system dynamics are

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and if we knew exactly what the external disturbances are

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
invented principal we could design and acceleration namely an input

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
dead would exactly generate

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
0 output in other words the angle would be equal to 0 but as you can imagine

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
just is its basically impossible to balance a broom

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in the palm of your hand with your eyes close

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
what is very hard to ascertain in advance or what the various

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
dynamics and disturbances are and so more typically

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
what you with a kid doing is measuring

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the output angle and

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
then using that measurement to somehow

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
influence the applied acceleration or fours

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and that then is an example other feedback system

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
so we would major the output angle

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and generate

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
an input acceleration which is

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
some function love what that output angle is

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and if we choose the feedback dynamics correctly

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
then in fact we can drive this output 20

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
this is one example love a system

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
which is inherently unstable because if we left it to its own

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
devices the pendulum with simply fall down and essentially by applying

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
feedback

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
what we're trying to do is stabilize this inherently unstable system

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and we'll talk a little bit more about that specific application feedback

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
shortly another common example a feedback

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
is in positioning our tracking systems

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and I aid indicate one here

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
which corresponds to the problem love positioning

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
a telescope which is mounted on a rotating platform

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
so in a system that tape for example

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I indicate here the rotating platform in the telescope

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it's driven by a motor and again

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we could imagine in principle the possibility love

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
driving this to the desired angle

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
by choosing an appropriate applied input voltage

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and as long as we know such things as what the disturbances are that influence

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the telescope mount and what the characteristics that the motor are

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in principle we could in fact

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
carry this out in a form which is referred to as open loop

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
namely we can choose an appropriate input voltage

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to drive a motor to set

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the platform ankle at the desired angular position

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
however again there are enough unknowns in a problem like that

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so that one is motivated to employ

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
feedback namely to make a measurement

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
up the output angle and use that in a feedback loop

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to influence the press the drive for the motor

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so that the motor so that the telescope platform is positioned appropriately

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
so if we look at this in a feedback

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
context we would then

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
take the measured output angle

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and the measured output angle

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
would be fed back and compared

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with the desired angle and

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the difference between those which essentially is the error between the

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
platform positioning and the desired position

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
would be put perhaps through an appropriate gainer attenuation

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and used as the exhortation to the motor

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so in the mechanical or physical system

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that would correspond to measuring the angle let's say

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
with the potentiometer so here we're measuring

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the angle and we have an output which is proportional

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to that measured angle and then we would use

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
feedback comparing

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the measured angle to some

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
proportionality factor multiplying the desired angle

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so here we have the desired angle

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
again through some type a potentiometer

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the two are compared I do the comparator

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
we basically have an indication of what the difference

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
is and that represents an error between the desired in the true Engel

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and then that is used through perhaps an amplifier

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to control the motor and in that case

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
of course when the air goes to zero that means that the actual angle on the

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
desired angle

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
are equal and in fact in that case also with this system

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the input to the motor is likewise equal to 0

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
now and as i've illustrated here

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it tends to be in the context or a continuous-time

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
or analog system and in fact another very common

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
way of doing positioning or tracking is

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to instead implement the feedback

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
using a discrete I'm a digital system

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and so in that case we would basically take the

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
position output as its measures

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
sample at a sexually

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
convert that to additional discrete-time

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
signal and then that is used in conjunction

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
with the desired angle

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
which both foreign ports to this processor

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and the output a bad is converted let's say back to

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and a an analog a continuous-time voltage and used to drive the motor

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
now you could ask why would you go to

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
a digital or discrete time measurement rather than doing it

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the way a I showed on the previous overlay which seemed relatively

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
straightforward

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and the reason principally is dead in the context of a digital implementation

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the feedback process often

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you can implement a better controlled

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
an offense also more sophisticated

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
algorithm for the feedback dynamic so that you can take a cab perhaps not only

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the angle itself but also love the rate of change a bang going in fact

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the rate of change in the rate of change in angle and

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
so the system Isis shown air then

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
is basically has a discrete-time

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
or digital feedback loop around a continuous-time system

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
now open this is an example 0

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in fact the more general way in which

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
discrete-time feedback is used with

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
continuous systems and

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
let me indicate in general what such

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
what the character a block diagram such a system might be

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
typically if we abstract away from the telescope Positioning System

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we might have a more general continuous-time system

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and around which we want to apply some feedback which we could do with a

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
continuous-time system

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or with the discrete-time system by first

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
converting the signals to discrete-time signals

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
then processing that with a discrete-time system

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and then through inappropriate interpolation algorithm

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we would then convert that back to

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a continuous-time signal and

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the difference between the input signal and this continues to signal which is

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
fed back

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
then forms the exhortation to the system that

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
essentially we're trying to control and in

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
many systems that this type the advantage

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is that this system can be implemented

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
in a very reproducible way either with a digital computer computer

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
or with microprocessor and although

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
we're not going to go into this in any detail

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in this lecture there is some discussion this in the text

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
essentially if we make certain assumptions about

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this particular feedback system we can

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
move the continues to discrete-time converter

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
up to this point and to this point and we can move

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the interpolating system outside

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the summer and what happens in that case

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is that we end up with what

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
looks like an inherently discrete-time

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
feedback system so in fact we take those steps

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
then what we'll end up with for a feedback system

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is a system that essentially

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
can be analyzed as a discrete-time system

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
here we have what is in the forward path

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and is basically the continuous-time system

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with the interpolator at one end and it continues to discrete-time converter at

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the other end

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and then we have whatever system it was in the feedback loop

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
discrete-time that shows up in this

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
feedback loop well show this

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
mainly to emphasize the fact although there are some steps there that we

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
obviously left out

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I show that mainly to emphasize the fact that feedback arises

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
not just in the context of continuous-time systems

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but also the analysis love discrete-time

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
feedback systems becomes important perhaps because

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we have used discrete-time feedback around a continuous-time system

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but also perhaps because the feedback system

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is inherently discrete-time in lobby and just illustrate

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
one or indicate one example in which

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that might arise this is an example

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in which which is also

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
discussed in so in more detail in the text

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but basically population studies for example

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
represent examples all discrete-time feedback systems

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
where let's say that we have some type of model

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
for population growth and since people come

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
in imager amounts that represents essentially

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the the I the output over any population model

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
essentially are inherently represents a sequence namely its index

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
on an integer variable

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and typically models for population growth

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
are unstable systems you can kind imagine that because

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if you take simple models the population and what happens is that

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the in any generation the

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
number all people or

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
animals or whatever it is that this is modeling

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
grows essentially exponentially I love with

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
the size the previous generation now where does the feedback come in

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
well the feedback typically comes in in in

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
incorporating in the overall model various retarding factors for example

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
as the population increases the food supply becomes more limited

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and that a sexually as a feedback process

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
dead acts to

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
retard the population growth and so

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
an overall model are somewhat simplified

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
for a for a population system

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
is the open-loop model in the absence of retarding factors

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and then very often the retarding factors

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
can be described as being related

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
to the size of the population and those

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
essentially act to reduce

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the overall input to the population model

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and so population studies are

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
one very common example love discrete-time feedback systems

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
well what would a look at and understand

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
are the basic properties love

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
feedback systems and to do that

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
let's look at the basic block diagrams and equations

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
for feedback systems either continuous-time and discrete-time

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
let's begin with

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the continuous-time case

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and now what we've done is simply abstract out

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
any of the applications to a fairly general system

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in which we have a system HVS

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
in what's referred to as the forward path

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and a system GIS in the feedback path

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and the the

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
input to the system HVS is the difference between the input to the

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
overall system

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and the output out the feedback loop

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and I draw your attention to the fact that

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
what we illustrate here and what we're analyzing is negative feedback

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
namely this out this output is attracted

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
from the input and thats done

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
more for reasons have convention than for any other reasons

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
its typical to do that an appropriate certainly

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
in some feedback systems but not all and

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the output of the answer is commonly referred to as the error signal

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
indicating that is the difference between the signal fed back

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and the input to the overall system

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
now if we want to analyze the feedback system

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
we would do that essentially by writing the appropriate equations

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and its best done and generating

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
the equivalent system function for the overall system

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it's best on in the frequency or poss transform domain

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
rather than a in the time domain and let me just indicate

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what the steps are that are involved in there are few steps have algebra that

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I that I'll leave in your hands but basically if we look at

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
this feedback system we can label of course is the output is why ft

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we can label they look lost transform the output is why evas

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and we also have YS as the input here

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
because this is the system function the apostrophe s former varsity is simply

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the applause transformer this and for which is why our best times Govs

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so here we have why evas times

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Govs at the air

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the input here is excessive ass

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and so the law applies transform of the error signal

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is simply exit ass

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
minus our best which is why I've SG a vast so this is minus why evas

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
GFS thats

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the love postures for the error signal the apostrophe its form

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
all the output if this system is simply

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
this expression times HFS

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so that's what we have here but what we have here we already called why evas

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
so in fact we can simply say dead

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
these two expressions have to be equal

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and so we've essentially done the analysis

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
saying that those two expressions are equal lets us
