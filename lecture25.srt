during the course we've developed a
number

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,830 
love very powerful and useful tools and
we've seen how

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,130 
these can be used in designing and
analyzing systems for example for

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,260 
filtering for modulation et cetera

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,700 
I'd like to conclude this

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,130 
series of lectures with an introduction
to one more

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,270 
important topic namely the

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,930 
analysis love feedback systems and

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,430 
what are the principal reasons that we
have left

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,760 
this discussion to the last part of the
cores is so that we can exploit

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,369 
some of the ideas that we've just
developed in

25
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,310 
summer the previous lectures namely the
tools afforded us by

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,119 
applause NZ transforms now

27
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,759 
as I had indicated in one of the

28
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,399 
very first lectures a common example

29
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,800 
a feedback system is the problem love
let's say

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,649 
balancing a broom or in the case if that
lecture balancing

31
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,229 
my son's force on in the palm of your
hand

32
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,590 
and kinda the idea there is dead

33
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,020 
what that relies on in order to

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,380 
make that a stable system is feedback in
that particular case visual feedback

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,050 
that specific problem the one about
saying something let's say in the palm

36
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,940 
of your hand

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,319 
is an example love a problem which is
commonly referred to as

38
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,069 
inverted pendulum and it's one that we
will actually be analyzing

39
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,610 
in a fair manner detailed not in this
lecture but in the next lecture

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,100 
but let me just kinda vindicate what so
the issues

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,060 
are let me describe this into context
not over balancing a broom on your hand

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,569 
but

43
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,209 
let's say that we have a mechanical
system which consists of a card

44
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,190 
and the card can move let's say in one
dimension

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,590 
and it has mounted on it

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,599 
a bar a ride with the weight on the top

47
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,299 
and it pivots around the base so that
essentially represents the

48
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,709 
inverted pendulum so that system can be

49
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,610 
more or less depicted as i've indicated
here and this is the cart

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,360 
that can move along the x-axis and

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,819 
here we have a pivot point a ride await
at the top

52
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,930 
and then of course there's several
forces acting on this and

53
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,489 
their is an acceleration that can be
applied to the cart:

54
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,540 
and that will be thought a as the
external input

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,519 
and then on the pendulum itself on the
wait

56
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,670 
there is the force of gravity and

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,480 
then typically said if external
disturbances that might

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,510 
represent for example air currents or
wind or whatever

59
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,709 
dead will attempt to

60
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,670 
Dez to destabilize the system
specifically

61
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,909 
to have the pendulum fall down now

62
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,180 
if we look at this system in more or
less

63
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,689 
a straightforward way what we have then

64
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:10,519 
are the system dynamics and

65
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,409 
several inputs one of which is the
external disturbances

66
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,299 
and the second is the acceleration which
is

67
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,310 
the external acceleration is supplied
and the app for the system can be

68
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,120 
thought I love

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,030 
as the angular displacement love the
pendulum which

70
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,090 
if we want a balanced we would like that
angular displacement to be equal to 0

71
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,830 
now if we know exactly what the system
dynamics are

72
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,660 
and if we knew exactly what the external
disturbances are

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,540 
invented principal we could design and
acceleration namely an input

74
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,820 
dead would exactly generate

75
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,110 
0 output in other words the angle would
be equal to 0 but as you can imagine

76
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,910 
just is its basically impossible to
balance a broom

77
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,520 
in the palm of your hand with your eyes
close

78
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,880 
what is very hard to ascertain in
advance or what the various

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,530 
dynamics and disturbances are and so
more typically

80
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,919 
what you with a kid doing is measuring

81
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,930 
the output angle and

82
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,000 
then using that measurement to somehow

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,940 
influence the applied acceleration or
fours

84
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,669 
and that then is an example other
feedback system

85
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,360 
so we would major the output angle

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,500 
and generate

87
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,090 
an input acceleration which is

88
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,300 
some function love what that output
angle is

89
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,030 
and if we choose the feedback dynamics
correctly

90
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,430 
then in fact we can drive this output 20

91
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,229 
this is one example love a system

92
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,910 
which is inherently unstable because if
we left it to its own

93
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,410 
devices the pendulum with simply fall
down and essentially by applying

94
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,440 
feedback

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,400 
what we're trying to do is stabilize
this inherently unstable system

96
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,000 
and we'll talk a little bit more about
that specific application feedback

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,710 
shortly another common example a
feedback

98
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,949 
is in positioning our tracking systems

99
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,150 
and I aid indicate one here

100
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,069 
which corresponds to the problem love
positioning

101
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,990 
a telescope which is mounted on a
rotating platform

102
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,880 
so in a system that tape for example

103
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,979 
I indicate here the rotating platform in
the telescope

104
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,539 
it's driven by a motor and again

105
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,729 
we could imagine in principle the
possibility love

106
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,889 
driving this to the desired angle

107
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,379 
by choosing an appropriate applied input
voltage

108
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,129 
and as long as we know such things as
what the disturbances are that influence

109
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,240 
the telescope mount and what the
characteristics that the motor are

110
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,410 
in principle we could in fact

111
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,870 
carry this out in a form which is
referred to as open loop

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,139 
namely we can choose an appropriate
input voltage

113
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,259 
to drive a motor to set

114
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,460 
the platform ankle at the desired
angular position

115
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,250 
however again there are enough unknowns
in a problem like that

116
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,830 
so that one is motivated to employ

117
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,050 
feedback namely to make a measurement

118
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,229 
up the output angle and use that in a
feedback loop

119
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,190 
to influence the press the drive for the
motor

120
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,629 
so that the motor so that the telescope
platform is positioned appropriately

121
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,050 
so if we look at this in a feedback

122
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,650 
context we would then

123
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,780 
take the measured output angle

124
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,900 
and the measured output angle

125
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,909 
would be fed back and compared

126
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:13,460 
with the desired angle and

127
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,270 
the difference between those which
essentially is the error between the

128
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,280 
platform positioning and the desired
position

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,180 
would be put perhaps through an
appropriate gainer attenuation

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,870 
and used as the exhortation to the motor

131
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,330 
so in the mechanical or physical system

132
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,150 
that would correspond to measuring the
angle let's say

133
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,700 
with the potentiometer so here we're
measuring

134
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,050 
the angle and we have an output which is
proportional

135
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,920 
to that measured angle and then we would
use

136
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,690 
feedback comparing

137
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,240 
the measured angle to some

138
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,540 
proportionality factor multiplying the
desired angle

139
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,560 
so here we have the desired angle

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,670 
again through some type a potentiometer

141
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,990 
the two are compared I do the comparator

142
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,230 
we basically have an indication of what
the difference

143
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,230 
is and that represents an error between
the desired in the true Engel

144
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,760 
and then that is used through perhaps an
amplifier

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,390 
to control the motor and in that case

146
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,940 
of course when the air goes to zero that
means that the actual angle on the

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,050 
desired angle

148
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,130 
are equal and in fact in that case also
with this system

149
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,190 
the input to the motor is likewise equal
to 0

150
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,190 
now and as i've illustrated here

151
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,220 
it tends to be in the context or a
continuous-time

152
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,089 
or analog system and in fact another
very common

153
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,870 
way of doing positioning or tracking is

154
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,890 
to instead implement the feedback

155
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,300 
using a discrete I'm a digital system

156
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,120 
and so in that case we would basically
take the

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,779 
position output as its measures

158
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,820 
sample at a sexually

159
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,709 
convert that to additional discrete-time

160
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:22,060 
signal and then that is used in
conjunction

161
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,570 
with the desired angle

162
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,070 
which both foreign ports to this
processor

163
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,570 
and the output a bad is converted let's
say back to

164
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:40,089 
and a an analog a continuous-time
voltage and used to drive the motor

165
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,790 
now you could ask why would you go to

166
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,310 
a digital or discrete time measurement
rather than doing it

167
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,100 
the way a I showed on the previous
overlay which seemed relatively

168
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500 
straightforward

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,889 
and the reason principally is dead in
the context of a digital implementation

170
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,200 
the feedback process often

171
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,459 
you can implement a better controlled

172
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,800 
an offense also more sophisticated

173
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,700 
algorithm for the feedback dynamic so
that you can take a cab perhaps not only

174
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,660 
the angle itself but also love the rate
of change a bang going in fact

175
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,240 
the rate of change in the rate of change
in angle and

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,310 
so the system Isis shown air then

177
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,200 
is basically has a discrete-time

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,000 
or digital feedback loop around a
continuous-time system

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,010 
now open this is an example 0

180
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,769 
in fact the more general way in which

181
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,200 
discrete-time feedback is used with

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,459 
continuous systems and

183
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,700 
let me indicate in general what such

184
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,510 
what the character a block diagram such
a system might be

185
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:59,089 
typically if we abstract away from the
telescope Positioning System

186
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,700 
we might have a more general
continuous-time system

187
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,519 
and around which we want to apply some
feedback which we could do with a

188
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,260 
continuous-time system

189
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,899 
or with the discrete-time system by
first

190
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:20,310 
converting the signals to discrete-time
signals

191
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,610 
then processing that with a
discrete-time system

192
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,610 
and then through inappropriate
interpolation algorithm

193
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,410 
we would then convert that back to

194
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,029 
a continuous-time signal and

195
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,240 
the difference between the input signal
and this continues to signal which is

196
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,410 
fed back

197
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,730 
then forms the exhortation to the system
that

198
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,949 
essentially we're trying to control and
in

199
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:51,860 
many systems that this type the
advantage

200
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,959 
is that this system can be implemented

201
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,769 
in a very reproducible way either with a
digital computer computer

202
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,250 
or with microprocessor and although

203
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,120 
we're not going to go into this in any
detail

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,579 
in this lecture there is some discussion
this in the text

205
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,149 
essentially if we make certain
assumptions about

206
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,079 
this particular feedback system we can

207
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,570 
move the continues to discrete-time
converter

208
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,500 
up to this point and to this point and
we can move

209
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,070 
the interpolating system outside

210
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,050 
the summer and what happens in that case

211
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,209 
is that we end up with what

212
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,399 
looks like an inherently discrete-time

213
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,310 
feedback system so in fact we take those
steps

214
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,959 
then what we'll end up with for a
feedback system

215
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,040 
is a system that essentially

216
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,800 
can be analyzed as a discrete-time
system

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,240 
here we have what is in the forward path

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,370 
and is basically the continuous-time
system

219
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,519 
with the interpolator at one end and it
continues to discrete-time converter at

220
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,690 
the other end

221
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,889 
and then we have whatever system it was
in the feedback loop

222
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,300 
discrete-time that shows up in this

223
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,529 
feedback loop well show this

224
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,680 
mainly to emphasize the fact although
there are some steps there that we

225
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,459 
obviously left out

226
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,589 
I show that mainly to emphasize the fact
that feedback arises

227
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,100 
not just in the context of
continuous-time systems

228
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,660 
but also the analysis love discrete-time

229
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,910 
feedback systems becomes important
perhaps because

230
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,639 
we have used discrete-time feedback
around a continuous-time system

231
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,779 
but also perhaps because the feedback
system

232
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,540 
is inherently discrete-time in lobby and
just illustrate

233
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,600 
one or indicate one example in which

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,139 
that might arise this is an example

235
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,139 
in which which is also

236
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,269 
discussed in so in more detail in the
text

237
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,970 
but basically population studies for
example

238
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,880 
represent examples all discrete-time
feedback systems

239
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,449 
where let's say that we have some type
of model

240
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,009 
for population growth and since people
come

241
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,300 
in imager amounts that represents
essentially

242
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,870 
the the I the output over any population
model

243
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,250 
essentially are inherently represents a
sequence namely its index

244
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,600 
on an integer variable

245
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,820 
and typically models for population
growth

246
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,350 
are unstable systems you can kind
imagine that because

247
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,009 
if you take simple models the population
and what happens is that

248
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,139 
the in any generation the

249
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,410 
number all people or

250
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,630 
animals or whatever it is that this is
modeling

251
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,180 
grows essentially exponentially I love
with

252
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,350 
the size the previous generation now
where does the feedback come in

253
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,160 
well the feedback typically comes in in
in

254
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,240 
incorporating in the overall model
various retarding factors for example

255
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,290 
as the population increases the food
supply becomes more limited

256
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,779 
and that a sexually as a feedback
process

257
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,019 
dead acts to

258
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,420 
retard the population growth and so

259
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,000 
an overall model are somewhat simplified

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,199 
for a for a population system

261
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,269 
is the open-loop model in the absence of
retarding factors

262
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,579 
and then very often the retarding
factors

263
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,380 
can be described as being related

264
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,720 
to the size of the population and those

265
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920 
essentially act to reduce

266
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,060 
the overall input to the population
model

267
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,470 
and so population studies are

268
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:14,470 
one very common example love
discrete-time feedback systems

269
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,940 
well what would a look at and understand

270
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,150 
are the basic properties love

271
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,600 
feedback systems and to do that

272
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,790 
let's look at the basic block diagrams
and equations

273
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,220 
for feedback systems either
continuous-time and discrete-time

274
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,280 
let's begin with

275
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,560 
the continuous-time case

276
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,200 
and now what we've done is simply
abstract out

277
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,310 
any of the applications to a fairly
general system

278
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,880 
in which we have a system HVS

279
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,730 
in what's referred to as the forward
path

280
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,400 
and a system GIS in the feedback path

281
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,590 
and the the

282
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,200 
input to the system HVS is the
difference between the input to the

283
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,720 
overall system

284
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,010 
and the output out the feedback loop

285
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,210 
and I draw your attention to the fact
that

286
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,700 
what we illustrate here and what we're
analyzing is negative feedback

287
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,730 
namely this out this output is attracted

288
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,830 
from the input and thats done

289
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,370 
more for reasons have convention than
for any other reasons

290
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,110 
its typical to do that an appropriate
certainly

291
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,580 
in some feedback systems but not all and

292
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,340 
the output of the answer is commonly
referred to as the error signal

293
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,840 
indicating that is the difference
between the signal fed back

294
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,250 
and the input to the overall system

295
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,940 
now if we want to analyze the feedback
system

296
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,960 
we would do that essentially by writing
the appropriate equations

297
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,640 
and its best done and generating

298
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,090 
the equivalent system function for the
overall system

299
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:08,060 
it's best on in the frequency or poss
transform domain

300
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,770 
rather than a in the time domain and let
me just indicate

301
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,770 
what the steps are that are involved in
there are few steps have algebra that

302
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,350 
I that I'll leave in your hands but
basically if we look at

303
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,030 
this feedback system we can label of
course is the output is why ft

304
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,450 
we can label they look lost transform
the output is why evas

305
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,330 
and we also have YS as the input here

306
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,160 
because this is the system function the
apostrophe s former varsity is simply

307
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,060 
the applause transformer this and for
which is why our best times Govs

308
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,400 
so here we have why evas times

309
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,950 
Govs at the air

310
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,950 
the input here is excessive ass

311
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,980 
and so the law applies transform of the
error signal

312
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,330 
is simply exit ass

313
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,690 
minus our best which is why I've SG a
vast so this is minus why evas

314
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,050 
GFS thats

315
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,160 
the love postures for the error signal
the apostrophe its form

316
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,330 
all the output if this system is simply

317
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,320 
this expression times HFS

318
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,610 
so that's what we have here but what we
have here we already called why evas

319
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,050 
so in fact we can simply say dead

320
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,180 
these two expressions have to be equal

321
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,570 
and so we've essentially done the
analysis

322
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,000 
saying that those two expressions are
equal lets us

323
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,940 
solve for y más over Xmas which is the
overall system function

324
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,750 
and if we do that what we end up with
for the overall system function

325
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,910 
is the algebraic expression that I
indicate here

326
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,400 
its HFS divided by one-plus

327
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,960 
GFS HFS said another way

328
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,050 
its the system function in the open-loop
forward path

329
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:15,170 
divided by one-plus what's referred to
as the loop gain

330
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,810 
GFS times HFS let's just look back up at
the block diagram

331
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,050 
GFS times HFS is

332
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,180 
simply the gain around the entire loop

333
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,800 
from this point around to this point

334
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,390 
so the overall system function is the
gain in the forward path

335
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,180 
divided by one-plus the loop gain which
is

336
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,480 
HFS times GFS now

337
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,680 
none of the equations that we wrote head
relied specifically on this being

338
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,910 
continuous time we just did some algebra

339
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,540 
and we use the system function property
of the system's

340
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,690 
at so pretty obviously the same kinda

341
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,780 
algebraic procedure would work in
discrete-time

342
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,250 
and so in fact if we carried out a
discrete-time analysis

343
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,980 
rather than a continuous-time analysis
we would simply

344
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,160 
and up with exactly the same

345
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,590 
system and exactly the same

346
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,170 
a question for the

347
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,490 
overall system function the only
difference being that

348
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,440 
here things are functional see whereas
if I just flipped back

349
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,780 
the other overlay we simply have

350
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:40,050 
previously everything as a function of
tea and a frequency-domain

351
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,700 
s in the discrete-time case

352
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,160 
we've simply replaced in the time domain
the independent variable by

353
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,780 
and and in the frequency domain

354
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,860 
the independent variable by C

355
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,360 
so what we see is that

356
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,790 
the we have a basic feedback equation

357
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,040 
and that feedback equation is exactly
the same for continuous-time and

358
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,220 
discrete-time

359
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,560 
although we have to be careful about
what implications we draw

360
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,260 
depending on whether we're talking about
continuous-time

361
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,840 
for discrete-time

362
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,910 
now to illustrate

363
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,560 
the importance a feedback let's look at

364
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,750 
a number love common applications

365
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,530 
and also as we talk about these
applications will see

366
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,860 
is dead while these applications

367
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,240 
and context in which feedback is used
are

368
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,270 
extremely useful and powerful they

369
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,320 
fallout in a an almost straightforward
way

370
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440 
from is very simple feedback equation

371
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,780 
that we've just arrived well

372
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,990 
the examples that I want to just talk
about

373
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,000 
are for civil the

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,040 
use the feedback in amplifier design and
we're not going to

375
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,320 
design ample fires in detail but what
I'd like to illustrate

376
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,100 
is the basic principle behind why
feedback

377
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,130 
is useful in designing amplifiers in
particular

378
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,170 
how it plays a role in compensating

379
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,310 
for a9 constant frequency response

380
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,440 
that's so that's one context that will
talk about

381
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,210 
a second that I'll indicate is the use
the feedback

382
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,890 
for implementing infers systems

383
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,690 
and a third which we indicated it

384
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,000 
in the case the inverted pendulum is
important

385
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,860 
context in which feedback is used is in
stabilizing unstable systems

386
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,420 
and what we want to see is wire how

387
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,880 
the a feedback system where the basic
feedback equation

388
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,260 
in fact letters to each of these various
things

389
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,770 
well let's begin with amplifier design

390
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,080 
and let's suppose that we've

391
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,180 
built somehow without feedback

392
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,380 
and ample fire that is terrific in terms
of its game

393
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,820 
but has the problem dead whereas we
might like the ample fire to have

394
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,320 
a very flat frequency response in fact
the frequency response to the sample

395
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,190 
fire

396
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,490 
is 9 constant and what we'd like to do

397
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,650 
is compensate for that well it turns out
interestingly

398
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,190 
dead if we embed the amplifier in a
feedback loop

399
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,170 
where in a feedback path we incorporate
an attenuator

400
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,500 
then in fact we can compensate for that
nine constant frequency response

401
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,970 
well let's see how that works out for
the feedback equation

402
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,310 
we have the basic feedback equation we
derive that we want to look at frequency

403
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,340 
response

404
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,810 
so we look specifically at the Fourier
transform and of course

405
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,050 
the frequency response to be overall
system is

406
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,190 
the frequency response to the out at the
Fourier transform the output divided by

407
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,490 
the input using the feedback equation
that we just arrived

408
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,360 
that has in the numerator the frequency
response in the forward path divided by

409
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,410 
one plus

410
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,420 
the loop gain which is hijo may get
times K

411
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,080 
and this is the key because here

412
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,570 
if we choose K times HJ Omega

413
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,700 
to be very large much larger than 1

414
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,000 
then what happens is that these two

415
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,450 
cancel out hijo may get times hijo

416
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,240 
Hojo Maki here and in the denominator
will cancel out

417
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,770 
as long as this term dominates and in
that case

418
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,310 
under that assumption the overall system
function is approximately

419
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,350 
one over K

420
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,560 
well if K is constant

421
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,130 
as a function of frequency then we
somehow magically have ended up

422
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:11,250 
with an amplifier that has a flat
frequency response

423
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,360 
well it seems like we're getting
something for nothing and actually

424
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,060 
were not there's a price that we pay for
that because

425
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,810 
notice the fact dead in order to get

426
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,740 
gain out at the overall system

427
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,510 
K must be less than one so this has the
correspond to an attenuator

428
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,760 
and we also require that

429
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,890 
K which is less than one times the game
up the original amplifier

430
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,270 
that that product be greater than one
and the implication of this without

431
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,020 
tracking it in detail right now the
implication it in this

432
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,090 
is dead whereas we flattened the
frequency response

433
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,560 
we have in fact been paid a price for
that the price we paid is that

434
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,750 
the game is somewhat reduced from the
gain

435
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,240 
that we had before the feedback because
k times H

436
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,550 
must be much larger than 1 but the
gayness

437
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,830 
is proportional to one over K now one
last point to make

438
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,690 
related to that when Caswell why is it
any easier

439
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,820 
to make a flat with frequency then

440
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,340 
to build a flat an amplifier with the
flat frequency response

441
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,030 
the reason is that the gain in the
feedback path

442
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,080 
is an attenuator not an amplifier and

443
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,280 
generally attenuation with a flat
frequency response is much easier to get

444
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,930 
then gainers for example a resistor
which

445
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,170 
attenuates with generally have a flatter
frequency response at a very high gain

446
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,180 
amplifier

447
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,470 
part so p.m. that's one common example

448
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,250 
feedback that and feedback in fact is is
very often used in

449
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,110 
high-quality ample fire systems another
very common example

450
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,550 
in which feedback is used is in

451
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,230 
implementing inverse systems

452
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,830 
now what I mean by that is suppose that

453
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,370 
we have a system which indicate here P
evas

454
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,670 
input and output and what we would like
to do

455
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,600 
is implemented a system which is the
infers that this system

456
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,640 
namely has a a-plus transformer system
function

457
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,030 
which is one over pls in for example

458
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,680 
we may have measure a particular system

459
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,150 
and what we would like to design is a
compensator for it

460
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,440 
and the question is by putting this in a
feedback loop

461
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,500 
can we in fact implement

462
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,590 
the inverse that this system the answer
to that is yes

463
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,850 
and the feedback system in that case is
as i indicate here

464
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,930 
so here what we choose to do

465
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,420 
is to put the system whose inverse we're
trying to generate

466
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,770 
in a feedback loop and

467
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,940 
in this case a high-gain in the forward
path

468
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,790 
now for this situation k is again a
constant but in fact that the high-gain

469
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,540 
constant

470
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,290 
and now if we look at the feedback
equation then

471
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,220 
what we see is equation if this form

472
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,210 
and notice that if K ties PFS

473
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,510 
is large compared with one

474
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:38,700 
then this term dominates the gain in the
forward path cancels out

475
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,060 
and what we're left with is a system
function

476
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,350 
which is just one over

477
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,070 
PFS an a sister this type

478
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,280 
is used in a whole variety of contexts
one very common one

479
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,820 
is in building what a call like a
rhythmic devices are like rhythmic

480
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,880 
amplifiers

481
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,510 
ones in which the input output
characteristic is like a rhythmic

482
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,030 
it's common to do that with a diode

483
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,310 
that has an exponential characteristic
and

484
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,430 
using that with feedback as feedback

485
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,730 
around a high gain operational amplifier
and by the way

486
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,680 
the logarithmic amplifier is nonlinear
what I said here's linear

487
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,120 
or the analysis here was linear but that
example in fact

488
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,330 
suggests something which is true which
is that

489
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:37,780 
that same basic idea in fact can be used
often in the context of nonlinear

490
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,270 
feedback and nonlinear feedback systems

491
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,470 
alright well as a final example

492
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,210 
what I'd like to analyze is the context
in which

493
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,710 
we would consider stabilizing

494
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,730 
unstable systems and

495
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,170 
I had indicated that one context in
which that arises and

496
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,120 
a which we will be analyzing the next
lecture

497
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,510 
is the inverted pendulum and

498
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,970 
in that situation or in a situation
where

499
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,160 
we're attempting to stabilize an
unstable system

500
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,750 
we have now in the forward path

501
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,110 
a system which is unstable

502
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,510 
and in the feedback pair

503
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,550 
we put inappropriate system

504
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:33,000 
so that the overall system in fact is
stable

505
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,320 
now how can stability at high rise

506
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,010 
outta having and initially unstable
system

507
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,980 
well again if we look at the basic
feedback equation

508
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,690 
the overall system function is the
system function for the forward path

509
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,340 
divided by a one plus the loop gain GFS
times HFS

510
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,570 
and for stability

511
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,770 
what we want to examine are the roots
have one plus GFS times HFS

512
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,360 
and in particular the polls are

513
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,910 
zeros up that factor

514
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,460 
and as long as we choose GFS so that

515
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,460 
the polls love this term

516
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,070 
I'm sorry so that the zeros at this term

517
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,010 
are in the left after the S plane

518
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,480 
then what we'll end up with is stability
so

519
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,020 
stability is dependent not just on HFS
for the closed-loop system

520
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,260 
but on one plus GFS times hrs

521
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,390 
and in this kind of notion

522
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,650 
is used in lots of situations

523
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,060 
I indicated the inverted pendulum
another very common example

524
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,900 
is in some very high performance
aircraft

525
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,920 
where the basic aircraft system

526
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,530 
is an unstable system but in fact

527
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,850 
it's stabilized by putting the right
kinda

528
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,730 
feedback dynamics around it and those
feedback dynamics might in fact

529
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,870 
involve the pilot is well

530
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:13,589 
now 4

531
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:16,780 
the system that we just talked about in

532
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,190 
the stability was

533
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,450 
described in terms of a continuous-time
system

534
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,690 
and the stability condition that we end
up with of course relates

535
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,730 
to the zeros love this the nominator
term

536
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,320 
and we require for stability dead the
real parts

537
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,609 
love The Associated roots bien the left
after the S point

538
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:46,220 
exactly the same kind analysis in terms
of stability

539
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,500 
apply is in discrete-time that is

540
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,089 
in discrete-time as we saw previously

541
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:58,850 
the basic discreet I feedback system is
exactly the same except that the

542
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,160 
independent variable

543
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,330 
is now an integer variable rather than a
continuous variable

544
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,400 
the feedback equation is exactly the
same

545
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,210 
so to analyze stability of the feedback
system

546
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,880 
we would want to look at this zeros love
one-plus

547
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,170 
GFZ times agency so again it's those
zeros

548
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,620 
that affect stability and the principal
difference

549
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,430 
between the continuous-time and
discrete-time cases

550
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,310 
is the fact that the stability condition

551
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,950 
in discrete-time is different than it is
in continuous time namely

552
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,050 
in continuous-time we care for stability

553
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,730 
about polls of the overall system

554
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,720 
being in the left and left after the
espy to the right half vs plane

555
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,760 
in discrete-time what we care about is

556
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,380 
whether the polls are inside or outside
the unit circle

557
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,010 
so in the discrete-time case

558
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,720 
what we wait impose for stability is
that the zeros

559
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,040 
have a magnet to which is less than one

560
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,700 
so the basic analysis is the same but

561
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,680 
the details at the stability condition
of course it different

562
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,740 
now wet just indicated

563
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,630 
is that feedback can be used

564
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,190 
to stabilize unstable system

565
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,630 
and as you can imagine is the other side
of the coin

566
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,890 
namely if you start with

567
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,930 
a stable system and put feedback around
it

568
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,270 
if you're not careful what can happen in
fact is that you can destabilize the

569
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,170 
system

570
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,160 
so is always the potential hazard unless
it's something you want to have happen

571
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,720 
dead feedback around what used to be a
stable system

572
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,430 
now generates a system which is on
stable and their

573
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,780 
are lots of examples at that one very
common example

574
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,380 
is in audio systems and this is probably
an example that your

575
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,410 
somewhat familiar with basically

576
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:14,300 
an audio system if you have the speaker
and microphone in any kind of proximity

577
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,510 
to each other

578
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,700 
is in fact the feedback system well

579
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,940 
first of all the audio input

580
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,870 
to the microphone consists of

581
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,250 
the external audio inputs

582
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,500 
which and the external audio inputs
might for example

583
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,580 
I be my voice that might be the room
noise

584
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,050 
and in fact as well as trade shortly if
I'm not careful

585
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,370 
might in fact be the output from speaker
which represents feedback

586
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,790 
that audio of course drives

587
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,820 
after appropriate amplification drives

588
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,390 
a speaker and

589
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,340 
if in fact the speaker

590
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,380 
is let's say has any proximity to

591
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,860 
the microphone then there can be a
certain amount of the output to the

592
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,130 
speaker

593
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,200 
that feeds back around

594
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,410 
and is fed back into

595
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,480 
the microphone now

596
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,350 
if the system function associated with
the feedback to indicate here as a

597
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,460 
constant

598
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,870 
times into my SS times capital T

599
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,950 
the in the minus s times capital T
represents the fact

600
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,090 
that their is in general some delay

601
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,590 
between the time delay between the
speaker output

602
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,820 
and the input that it generates to the
microphone

603
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,150 
the reason for that the lay of course
being dead

604
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,580 
there may be some distance between the
speaker and microphone

605
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,850 
and the constant k to that I have in the
feedback path

606
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,600 
represents the fact that between the
speaker in the microphone

607
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,660 
there may be some attenuation so

608
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,980 
if I have for example speakers I happen
to have here

609
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,530 
and I were too

610
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,280 
have that speaker putting out

611
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,260 
what in fact I'm putting into the
microphone or the app for the microphone

612
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,700 
than what we have is a feedback path and
the feedback path is from the microphone

613
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,950 
through the speaker I did the speaker
back into the microphone

614
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,840 
and the feedback path is from here

615
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,770 
to the microphone and the
characteristics or frequency response

616
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,020 
our system function

617
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,600 
is associated with the characteristics a
propagation a transmission

618
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,770 
if I we move closer to the speaker and I
by the way don't have the speaker on

619
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,980 
right now and I'm sure you all
understand why

620
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,760 
a in if I move closer then

621
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,440 
the constant k2 gets what

622
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,740 
gets larger and if I move further away
the constant k to get small

623
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,540 
Bardwell let's look at and analysis if
this and see what it is or why it is

624
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,750 
that in fact we

625
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,400 
getting instability in terms or that any
stability is predicted by the basic

626
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,540 
feedback equation

627
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,180 
now notice first of all they were
talking about positive feedback here

628
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,680 
and just simply substituting the
appropriate

629
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,310 
system functions into our basic feedback
equation

630
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,380 
we have an equation that says that the
overall system function

631
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,430 
is given by the forward gain which is
the gain of the amplifier

632
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,630 
between the microphone and speaker
divided by

633
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,110 
one minus because in the minus because
we have positive feedback

634
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,380 
the overall loop gain which is k1 k2

635
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,990 
either minus s capital T and these two
games k1 and k2

636
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,170 
are are assumed to be positive and

637
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,990 
and generally are positive so in order

638
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,300 
for us to a

639
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,460 
well if if you want to look at the polls
at the system

640
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,750 
then we want to look at this zeros this
the nominator

641
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,200 
and the zeros is this the nominator
occur at values %uh vests

642
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,980 
such that you to the minus s capital T
is equal to 1 over K one times k2

643
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,110 
and acquittal early that says that

644
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:31,150 
the the polls love the closed-loop
system

645
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,060 
occur at one over capital T in capital T

646
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,850 
is related to the time delay one over
capital T

647
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,360 
times the lock to the basie fk1 times k2

648
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,590 
well for stability we want

649
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,800 
these polls to all be in the left after
the S plane

650
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,740 
and what that means then is that for
stability

651
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,760 
well we require is dead k1 times k2

652
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,680 
be less than 1 in other words we require
that the overall loop gain

653
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,110 
the less the magnitude lou came P less
than 1

654
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,620 
if it's not then what we generate is
instability

655
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,980 
and just to illustrate that let's turn
the speaker on

656
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,100 
and what will demonstrate is feedback

657
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,840 
right now the system is stable are and
I'm being careful to keep my distance

658
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,320 
from the speaker

659
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,100 
as I get closer k2

660
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,510 
will increase and as k2 increases

661
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,370 
eventually the polls will move into the
right here for the S plane

662
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,120 
or they'll try to what will happen is
that the system will start oscillating

663
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,170 
going to nonlinear distortion

664
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,060 
so as I get closer you can hear that

665
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,540 
we get feedback we get isolation and you

666
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,290 
I guess neither you nor I can take too
much bad food

667
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,590 
the unseeded what's happening if we can
just turn the speaker of now

668
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,240 
and you can see that what's happening is
that as

669
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,690 
k2 increases the polls are moving

670
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,390 
on to the jail make axis the system
starts docile aid

671
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,500 
their own actually moving to the right
half plane because

672
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:22,500 
there are nonlinear nonlinearities that
inherently control system

673
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,780 
okay so what we've seen

674
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,380 
in the lecture at today's lecture

675
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,060 
is the basic analysis equation and

676
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,700 
a few of the applications and one
application

677
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,160 
that or one both application hazard that
we've talked about

678
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,770 
and is the application in which we

679
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,720 
may destabilize unstable systems or if
we're not careful

680
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,320 
destabilize stable systems as i've
indicated several

681
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,200 
times during the lecture one common
example

682
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,900 
love unstable system which feedback can
use be used to stabilize

683
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,100 
is the inverted pendulum which I refer
to several times

684
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,770 
and in the next lecture what I'd like to
do is

685
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,380 
focus in on a more detailed analysis at
this

686
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,410 
and what we'll see in fact is dead

687
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,630 
the feedback dynamics the former the
feedback dynamics

688
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,750 
are important with regard to whether you
can it can stabilize the system

689
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,210 
interestingly enough for this particular
system as we'll see in the next lecture

690
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,900 
if you simply try to measure the angle

691
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,890 
and feed that back that in fact you can
stabilize the system

692
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,240 
water requires is not only the angle

693
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,860 
but some information about the rate of
change angle

694
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,040 
but will see that in much more detail in
the next lecture

695
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,440 
thank you
