00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
sick still hurts in fact yes alias

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
down to what gets alias down to

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
6 go over to the input is for killer hurts

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
at the output now if we move up even further

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so to summarize

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
if we sample signal and then reconstruct
如果我们采样信号，然后重构

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
from the samples using a low-pass filter as long as the sampling frequency is
使用一个低通滤波器，只要取样频率为样品

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
we reconstruct exactly if on the other hand
我们确切地重建，如果在另一方面

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
the sampling frequency is too low less than twice the highest frequency
采样频率太低小于最高频率的两倍

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
then we get alias saying in other words
那么我们得到的别名说，换句话说

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
higher frequencies get folded or reflected
更高的频率得到折叠或反射

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
down into lower frequencies as they come through the low-pass filter

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
now wanted the

common applications love the whole concept of sampling

what's often referred to as discreet I processing

but and let me indicate that for

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that kinda processing essentially what happens

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
is dead we begin with a continuous-time signal
死了，我们开始了连续时间信号

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and convert it to a discrete-time signal
并将其转换为离散时间信号

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000

next time now in doing that

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of course as you can imagine it's important since we want

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to choose the sampling frequency to very carefully avoid aliasing
选择采样频率非常小心地避免混淆

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and so in fact in that context
所以其实在这方面

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and in many other contexts alias saying is something
而且在许多其他情况下别名说法是什么

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that we're very eager to avoid however

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
it's also important to understand that alias saying

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
isn't all bad and there are some very specific contexts in which
