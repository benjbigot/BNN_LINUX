1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:13,110 
ha the the

2
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,700 
the norm

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:36,870 
well

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,870 
the I'm out oppenheim

5
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,489 
and I'd like to welcome you to this
video tape course on signals and systems

6
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,989 
signals at least

7
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,579 
as an informal definition are functions

8
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,809 
one or more independent variables that

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,690 
typically carry some type information
systems in

10
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,610 
are setting with typically be used the
process signals

11
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,080 
one very common example of a signal

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,220 
might be let's say speech signal and you
might think

13
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,320 
love the air pressure as a function of
time

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,270 
or perhaps the electrical signal effort
goes through the microphone

15
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,820 
transducer is a function of time as
representing the speech signal

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,250 
and we might see a typical speech signal

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,290 
looking something like i've indicated
here

18
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,530 
its a function time

19
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,620 
in this particular case and the
independent variable

20
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,030 
being time is in fact continuous

21
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,870 
and so a signal like this we will
typically be referring to

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,080 
as a continuous-time signals now

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,930 
it also for this particular example is a
function

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,140 
one independent variable and

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,220 
that will be referred to as

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,390 
the one dimensional signal

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,489 
corresponding to the fact that there's
only

28
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,269 
one independent variable several
independent variables

29
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,769 
so the speech signal is an example

30
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,569 
a continuous-time one-dimensional signal

31
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,940 
now signals can of course

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,060 
be multi-dimensional and they may not
have as their independent variables time

33
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,930 
variables

34
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,930 
one very common example are

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,849 
the examples represented by images
images

36
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,319 
as signals we might think I'll as

37
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,069 
representing brightness as it varies

38
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,380 
in a horizontal and vertical

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,599 
direction and so the brightness as a
function

40
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,780 
these two spatial variables is then

41
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,780 
a two-dimensional signal and

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,709 
it the independent variables

43
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,760 
would typically be continuous but of
course they're not time variables

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,780 
and incidently it's worth

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,989 
just commenting very often simply for
convenience

46
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,880 
will have a tendency to refer to the
independent variables when we talk about

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,819 
signals

48
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,610 
as time variables whether or not the
really represent time

49
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,970 
well let me illustrate

50
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,340 
one example all image and

51
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,980 
this is a picture jpg for EA

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,250 
who perhaps more than anyone else

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,940 
is responsible for the elegance and
beauty

54
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,200 
a lot of the concepts we'll be talking
about throughout this course

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,340 
and when you look at this in addition to

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,520 
c4a himself you should recognize that
what you're looking at

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,420 
is basically a signal which is
brightness as a function

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,920 
the horizontal and vertical spatial
variables

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,230 
as another example

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,930 
an image as a signal let's look at an
aerial photograph

61
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,269 
this is an aerial photograph taken

62
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,519 
over a setter roads which

63
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,599 
you can more less recognized in the
picture and

64
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,110 
wanted the difficulties with this signal
is that it

65
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,490 
the road system is somewhat obscured by
cloud cover

66
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,680 
and well wanna show later

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,690 
as an example what a system

68
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,039 
might do to such as signal in terms of
processing is an attempt to

69
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,530 
at least compensate some way for the

70
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,000 
cloud cover represented in the
photograph following terms a

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,900 
the detailed analysis we go through
during the course are

72
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,669 
focus of attention is pretty much
restricted to

73
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,290 
one-dimensional signals in fact we will
be using

74
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,520 
two-dimensional signals more
specifically images

75
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,550 
very often to illustrate a variety

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,900 
concepts now

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,050 
speech in images are examples

78
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,639 
what we refer to as continuous-time
signals

79
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,680 
in that they are functions

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,770 
continuous variables equally

81
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,720 
important classes signals will be
concentrating on

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,190 
in the cores are signals are

83
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,300 
discrete-time signals

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,800 
where by discrete-time we mean

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,830 
is that the signal is

86
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,130 
a function integer variable

87
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,940 
and so specifically only takes on values

88
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,190 
at in nature values the argument

89
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,360 
so here is a graphical illustration

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,020 
the discrete-time signal and
discrete-time signals arise

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,550 
in a variety of ways one very common
example

92
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,280 
it seems fairly often is discrete-time
signals in the context

93
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,290 
economic time series and for example
stock market analysis

94
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,570 
so what I show here is one

95
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,250 
very commonly occurring example the
discrete-time signal

96
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,360 
it represents the weekly stock market
index

97
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,479 
the independent variable in this case is

98
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,550 
the week number and we see what the

99
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,190 
stock market is doing over this
particular period

100
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,440 
as a function or the number of the week
and

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,030 
course along the vertical axis is the

102
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,060 
weekly index incidently

103
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,590 
this particular period was not chosen

104
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,900 
random in fact captures very interesting
aspect

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,320 
stock market history namely the

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,680 
stock market crash in 1929

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,979 
which in fact is represented by behavior

108
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,610 
this discrete time signal or sequence

109
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,360 
in this particular area so this dramatic
dip in fact

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,639 
is the stock market crash 1929

111
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,570 
well the dow jones weekly average is an
example

112
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,560 
all a one-dimensional discrete-time
signal

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,780 
and just as with continuous time

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,830 
we had not just one-dimensional
multi-dimensional signals

115
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,160 
likewise we have multi-dimensional
signals

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,479 
in the discrete-time case where

117
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,870 
in that case then the discrete-time
signal that we're talking about a

118
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,880 
sequence

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,180 
is a function love to integer variables

120
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,030 
and is one example this might let's say
represent a spatial

121
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,400 
antenna array where this is

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,669 
array number in let's say the horizontal

123
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,590 
direction and this is array number in
the vertical direction

124
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,240 
both classes signals continuous-time and
discrete-time

125
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,060 
as i've indicated are very important and
it should be emphasized

126
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,720 
dead the importance I'll discrete-time
signals associated processing

127
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,419 
continues to grow in large part because

128
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,500 
I'll the current and emerging
technologies

129
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,630 
that permit basically the processing

130
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,880 
or continuous-time signals by

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,969 
first converting to discrete-time
signals

132
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,019 
and processing them with discrete time
systems

133
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,490 
and that in fact is a topic that we will

134
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,569 
discuss in a fair manner detail later on
in the course

135
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,649 
let's now turn our attention to systems

136
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,709 
and as they indicated a system

137
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,220 
basically processes signals

138
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,350 
and they have of course inputs

139
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,389 
and outputs and depending on

140
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,670 
whether we're talking about
continuous-time for discrete-time

141
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,389 
the system maybe a continuous-time
system

142
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,339 
or a discrete-time system so in the
continuous-time

143
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,389 
case I indicate here in input: accept T

144
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,480 
and an output y ft if we were talking

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,720 
about discrete-time system I would
represent

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,619 
the the input in terms a discrete-time

147
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,879 
variable and of course the output
interns a

148
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,059 
discrete-time variable also

149
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,819 
now in very general terms systems are
hard to deal with

150
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:45,569 
because is they are defined very broadly
a very generally

151
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,079 
and in dealing with systems and
analyzing

152
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,999 
what we will do is attempt to exploit

153
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,129 
some very specific and as we'll see

154
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,489 
very useful system properties

155
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:04,179 
to indicate what I mean and how things
might be split up

156
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,759 
we could talk about systems and we'll
talk about systems

157
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,459 
that are linear and we could

158
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,730 
divide systems basically into systems
that are either linear

159
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,129 
or nonlinear and we will

160
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:24,209 
or and also devices turns into systems
that are

161
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,369 
what we refer to as time-invariant

162
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:31,779 
or time-varying systems and these aren't
turns that

163
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,230 
we've defined yet of course but we will
be defining

164
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,249 
in the course very shortly and while

165
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:43,369 
in some sense this division represents
all systems and this those two

166
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:47,509 
the focus of the course is really going
to be principally

167
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:50,899 
on linear time-invariant systems

168
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,639 
so in its basically the system's

169
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,819 
that we will be focusing on and

170
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:01,389 
will be referring to those systems as
linear

171
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,910 
time-invariant systems

172
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,869 
well as a free clip said some other
kinds of things that systems can do

173
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,309 
let me illustrate first in

174
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,619 
I a one-dimensional continuous-time

175
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,629 
context and then later with a
discrete-time example

176
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,069 
one example I'll some processing

177
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,589 
I'll signals with an appropriate system

178
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,809 
the particular example that I want to
illustrate

179
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,759 
relates to the restoration or old
recordings

180
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,009 
and missus some work that was done by
Professor Thomas stocker who

181
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,339 
is at the University Utah and work that
he had done a number of years ago

182
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,589 
relating to the fact day in all
recordings

183
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,410 
for example in caruso recordings

184
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,049 
the recording was done through
mechanical morning

185
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,899 
and the characteristics love the horn
tended to vary from day to day

186
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,920 
and because if the characteristics of
the horn

187
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,879 
the recording tended to have a muffled
quality something like

188
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,959 
yes sorta the sense that you would get

189
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,139 
if you were speaking through a megaphone

190
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,860 
what professor stock and it was
developed a system

191
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,149 
to process these old recordings

192
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,259 
in such a way dead a lot or

193
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,359 
the characteristics and distortion do

194
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:31,999 
to that recording system was removed so
I'd like to

195
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:36,809 
illustrate that as one example some
signal processing with an appropriate

196
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,249 
continuous-time system and what you'll
hear

197
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:43,389 
is a to track recording

198
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:47,359 
on the first track is the original on
restored

199
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:51,199 
caruso recording and on the second track

200
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,290 
is the result of the restoration and so
as I switch back and forth

201
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,639 
from channel one to channel two will be
switching from

202
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,600 
the original to the restored will begin
the tape

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,109 
by playing the original and

204
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:10,199 
day and as it proceeds will switch

205
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,339 
so we begin on channel one

206
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:21,749 
low pS The Regent

207
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:27,119 
switch now process middle

208
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:31,770 
him home

209
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,670 
his back 0 hit

210
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,670 
back to the original p

211
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,740 
I read

212
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,760 
back to the restoration

213
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,230 
mine yard

214
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,260 
home

215
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,220 
and once again back to the rigid

216
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,930 
mid

217
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,820 
and presumably and hopefully what you
heard

218
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,970 
was dead in the restoration in fact a
lot of the muffled

219
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,510 
characteristics the original recording

220
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,950 
were compensated for or remove now

221
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,320 
one of the interesting things that
happened in fact in the work that

222
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,520 
lesser Stockham did is that in the
process of the restoration and perhaps

223
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,690 
you've heard this

224
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,410 
in the process of the restoration in
fact some other background noise on the

225
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,630 
recording

226
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,590 
was emphasize and so he processed

227
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,330 
this the signal further in an attempt to

228
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,210 
remove that background noise and with
that particular processing the

229
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,030 
processing

230
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,850 
was very highly nonlinear a very
interesting thing happened

231
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,020 
which was that not only in at processing

232
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,200 
was the background noise removal but
somewhat surprisingly

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,260 
also the orchestra was and let me just
plain bad

234
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,010 
now as an example love some very
sophisticated processing

235
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,140 
with the nonlinear system what you'll
hear on channel one

236
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,270 
0 is the restoration as

237
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,410 
we just plated when I switch to chat

238
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,630 
to will the Hampton

239
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,650 
processing him home

240
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,090 
and acted one now

241
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,180 
0 would im

242
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,120 
hell

243
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,630 
now inside

244
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,430 
back

245
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,420 
why did

246
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:56,640 
well

247
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,509 
him

248
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:02,350 
finally once again world

249
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,350 
okay so

250
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,980 
that's an example love processing Ave

251
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,079 
continuous-time signal with a
corresponding continuous-time

252
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,399 
system now I'd like to illustrate an
example

253
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,550 
some processing discrete-time signal and
I'd like to do that in the context that

254
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,579 
the example

255
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,800 
ratio before a discrete-time signal
which was

256
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,120 
the dow jones industrial weekly stock
market index

257
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,410 
I head shown it before as

258
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,550 
I've shown it here again over a period

259
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,850 
of slightly more than a year where this

260
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,050 
is the number of weeks and this is the

261
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,769 
weekly index and to illustrate

262
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,129 
some of the processing what I'd like to
do

263
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,160 
is show the stock market index

264
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,429 
weekly index over a much longer time
period a particular

265
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,740 
the weekly index over a ten year period

266
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,870 
and that's what I show here so

267
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,659 
what this covers is roughly 1927

268
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,919 
to 1937 and

269
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,750 
in this case although this is still a
discrete-time signal

270
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,020 
just simply for the purposes display
what we've done

271
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,450 
is to essentially connect the dots and

272
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,200 
draw continuous curve through the points
so that this picture isn't filled up

273
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,679 
with a lot of vertical lines

274
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,450 
so this is the discrete-time sequence

275
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,770 
represents the weekly Dow Jones

276
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,669 
Dow Jones index over a 10-year period
and

277
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,610 
here by the way again is the crash of
1929

278
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,179 
it's interesting to note by the way day

279
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:01,820 
actually the disaster in the stock
market wasn't so much the 1929 crash

280
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,190 
but the long downward trend that follow
that and you can see that here

281
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,280 
by kinda filtering through by I

282
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,870 
the rapid variations in the index and
what you see is this

283
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,950 
smooth downward trend followed

284
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,490 
eventually by upward trend now

285
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,760 
this issue love looking at something
like this looking at a sequence

286
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,850 
and following the smoother parts if it
namely

287
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,590 
the long-term trends is in fact
something

288
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,980 
that is done quite typically with
economic time series like this

289
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,620 
and in particular what's done is to
smooth it

290
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,130 
or average over some time period

291
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:56,130 
to emphasize the slow variations and
de-emphasize the rapid variations

292
00:18:56,149 --> 00:19:00,620 
and that in fact is processing that is
done

293
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,380 
with discrete-time system solos when you
hear referred to let's say

294
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,809 
in stock market reports fifty one day
moving average

295
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,080 
that in fact is processing the stock
market index

296
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,140 
with a particular discrete-time system
the result

297
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,720 
up doing that on this particular example

298
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,649 
generates a smooth version the curve
which I overly here

299
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,039 
and the overlay

300
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,700 
than is really attempting to track the

301
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,070 
smoother variations and deemphasized

302
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,240 
more rapid variations let me just

303
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,330 
slightly offset that so that the
different stands out a little more

304
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,130 
and so here you see what is

305
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,899 
the original weekly index and

306
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,470 
this is the result processing that
sequence

307
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,530 
with inappropriate system

308
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,039 
to apply smoothing and in fact

309
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,240 
what it is is a moving average and so
here again

310
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,380 
you can see the in the smooth occurred

311
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,460 
this general downward trend

312
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,220 
up until this time period followed by
eventually

313
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,470 
recovery I well we've seen

314
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,740 
example with a continuous-time signals

315
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,120 
caruso recording an example with the
discrete-time signal

316
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,919 
this stock market index and what I'd
also like to show

317
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,000 
is 30 example which is

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,110 
the result some processing on an image
in particular

319
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,919 
the image that we talked about before
which was the aerial photographs

320
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,030 
that had the problem some cloud cover

321
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,080 
so once again what we see here

322
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,950 
is the original aerial photograph

323
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,210 
with the cloud cover and

324
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,280 
some processing was applied to this
using a system

325
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,409 
which in fact was both nonlinear

326
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,669 
and quote time-varying or in the case

327
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,559 
these independent variables would refer
to it as spatially varying

328
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,179 
and the result applying that processing

329
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,480 
is shown in the joining

330
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,020 
picture and what we see the air is

331
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,370 
hopefully a reasonable attempt

332
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,419 
to compensate for the cloud cover and

333
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,179 
this by the way was some work was done
by Professor

334
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,630 
them MIT and has been

335
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,740 
very successful type processing were

336
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,919 
aerial photographs I should say also

337
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,889 
that this particular example is one
where although the original signal

338
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,260 
was a signal dead is continuous time
that is

339
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,360 
the independent variables are continuous
as they are in a spatial

340
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,270 
aerial photograph in fact for the
processing

341
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,850 
that picture was first converted to a
sequence

342
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,659 
through a process called sampling which
will be talking about later

343
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,590 
and then the processing in fact was done
on a digital computer

344
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,220 
okay well these then are some examples

345
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,360 
all the use I'll some

346
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,590 
systems to process

347
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,110 
some signals both in continuous-time

348
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,030 
in discrete-time for one-dimensional
signals

349
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,230 
and for multi-dimensional signals

350
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,030 
and as I kinda refer to systems we've

351
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,630 
thought of them as kinda one big block
with appropriate

352
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,710 
or associated input and output and

353
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,659 
as will be getting into in the first
part of the course

354
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,370 
very often systems are interconnected
together

355
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,260 
for a variety of reasons some other
kinds of interconnections that will talk

356
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,020 
about

357
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,309 
are connecting systems

358
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,370 
in what are called series are cascaded
connections

359
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,840 
parallel interconnections feedback

360
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,539 
interconnections and feedback
interconnections

361
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,780 
in fact are very interesting very
important

362
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,909 
for useful and will be major topic

363
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:22,120 
toward the end of the course feedback

364
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,460 
as you may or may not know

365
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,419 
comes into play in a variety of
situations

366
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:32,700 
for example an amplifier design is we'll
talk about

367
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,809 
the black feedback plays an important
role

368
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,299 
in a situation where you have

369
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:45,350 
a basically unstable system feedback is
often used to stabilize the system

370
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,350 
and feedback interconnections systems in
that sense

371
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,820 
are very often used in high-performance
aircraft

372
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,500 
which are inherently unstable and are
stabilized

373
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,780 
this kind in action

374
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,880 
just two give you a little sense this

375
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,960 
without going into any of the details

376
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,429 
what i'd like to show you is and excerpt

377
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:14,179 
from a lecture day

378
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,549 
we'll be seeing toward the end of the
course relating to

379
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,130 
feedback analysis a feedback systems and
uses a feedback

380
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,330 
and this is in the context what's
referred to

381
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,330 
as the inverted pendulum which is

382
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,550 
system that's basically unstable
feedback

383
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,530 
interconnections are used to stabilize
the idea

384
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,369 
as you'll see in this brief clip is that

385
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:42,619 
there is a cart that's moving on a track

386
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,919 
with a ride its pivoted at the base

387
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,360 
and so that system in the absence
anything

388
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,429 
is unstable in that the ride attend for

389
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:55,780 
and as we going to in detail in the
lecture

390
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,300 
later use feedback to

391
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,710 
position the card under the pendulum to
balance it

392
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,790 
and in fact that balancing can be done
even

393
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,610 
when we modify the system in a variety
of ways

394
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,760 
as you'll see in this clip so let's take
a look at that

395
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,169 
remembering that this is just a brief
excerpt

396
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,610 
from a longer discussion I can change
the

397
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,230 
overall system even further by

398
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,850 
let's say for example pouring a liquid

399
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,889 
and now let me also comment that

400
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:35,210 
change the physics of a little bit
because the

401
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,879 
the liquid can slash around a little bit
comes a little more complicated

402
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:42,320 
system but as you can see it still

403
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,590 
remains balance

404
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,379 
as you'll see when we get to it by the
way that demonstration was a lot of fun

405
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:51,309 
to do

406
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:57,379 
now in talking about signals and systems
as we go through the course

407
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:01,379 
their are several domains to in
particular

408
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:04,570 
that we will find convenient for

409
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,100 
the analysis and representation signals
and systems

410
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,270 
one is the time-domain

411
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,110 
which is what we tend to think

412
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,169 
and which we have kind of been focusing
on

413
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,980 
in the discussion so far in this lecture

414
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,220 
by equally important is what's referred
to

415
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,970 
as the frequency-domain

416
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,270 
as representation for signals

417
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,659 
and as a means for analysis for systems

418
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,049 
and in the context or the
frequency-domain representation

419
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,260 
some old the kinds a ideas on topics
that will be exploring

420
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,840 
are the Fourier transform and

421
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,500 
the le plus transform and

422
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,679 
a discrete-time counterpart the
apostrophe is for which is the sea

423
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,260 
transport

424
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,020 
the Fourier transform discussion will
get into fairly early in the course

425
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,510 
and the La Paz transforming z transform

426
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,220 
represent extensions the 48 transform
and will be getting into

427
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,960 
that later in the course just kinda
initially

428
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,030 
to think about the time domain and
frequency domain

429
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,530 
you might think for example over No
being played

430
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,110 
and the time-domain representation would
be

431
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,919 
how let's say the

432
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,369 
sound pressure as a function of time
would change

433
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,580 
and the frequency domain representation
would

434
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,990 
correspond to representation the
frequency content

435
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,450 
the No and in fact what I'd like to do
is

436
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,600 
illustrate that and those two domain
simultaneously

437
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,760 
by playing a glockenspiel

438
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,909 
no which'll here is the No

439
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,790 
repeated several times over and at the
same time

440
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,960 
you'll see to displays one on the left

441
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,850 
representing the time domain display a
representation

442
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,480 
the signal and the one on the right
representing the frequency

443
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,950 
me so let's look at that and

444
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:20,950 
you'll hear the note and simultaneously
see these two displays

445
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:24,540 
there's the No on the left time

446
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,460 
ways and on the right what we see

447
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,070 
is frequency content in particular

448
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,570 
indicating the fact dead there are
several harmonics

449
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:42,570 
lines tell

450
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,500 
okay well what I've gone thru

451
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,680 
in this lecture represents a brief
overview

452
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,480 
signals and systems and beginning with
the next lecture we will be

453
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,410 
much more specific and precise first

454
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,570 
discussing some basic signals and then

455
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,600 
talking about systems and system
properties and how to exploit

456
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,000 
as one final comment that I'd

457
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,750 
like to making this lecture I'd like to

458
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,750 
emphasizes at the out said

459
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,320 
dead the taped lectures

460
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,860 
represent only one com- ponent the cores

461
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,930 
and equally important will be

462
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,680 
both the textbook and the video course
manual in particular

463
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,810 
it's important not only to reviewing the
tapes

464
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,080 
but simultaneously or in conjunction
with that

465
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,520 
doing the appropriate reading in the
textbook and

466
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,330 
also working through the problems
carefully

467
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,190 
in the video course manual in a course
like this

468
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,290 
you basically only get out a bit as much
as you put into it

469
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,860 
the hope is dead if you put the

470
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,040 
right amount of time and effort into it
you'll find the course to be

471
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,070 
educational and interesting and I
certainly hope that will be the case

472
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,530 
thank you
