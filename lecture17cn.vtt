replacing them with triangles an

and you can see now that the reconstruction is somewhat smoother

is double the sample spacing both horizontal horizontally and vertically

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
this of course means there will be even more highly under sampled been

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
in the ones that I preview show previously showed and so the result of

the reconstructions with some low pass filtering

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
more and you can see the effect of the sampling

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and if we now apply is zero-order hold

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
to this picture we will again get a mosaic and lets

look at that and that mosaic of course looks

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
even block here than the original and again emphasizes the fact that the

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
in place at these original blocks what we get is

the fact that the triangles are smoother than the rectangles

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
again i emphasize that this looks so highly low-pass filtered
