040829~007000~the No
049680~007000~the in the last several lectures we talked about
059269~003271~a generalization love the continuous-time
062540~003360~Fourier transform and a very similar
065900~004380~strategy also applies to discrete-time and that's what we want to begin to deal
070280~001370~with in today's lecture
071650~003380~so what we want to talk about is
075030~003410~generalizing the four EA transform
078440~004209~and what this will lead to in discrete-time is a notion referred to as
082649~001101~the sea transport
083750~003030~now just as in continuous-time
086780~003750~in discrete-time the 48 transform
090530~003350~corresponded to a representation
093880~004390~love a sequence as a linear combination
098270~003489~love complex exponentials and
101759~005691~so this was the synthesis equation and of course there is the corresponding
107450~001430~analysis equation
108880~004140~and as you recall and as is
113020~003120~the same for continuous-time the reason
116140~003170~that we pick complex exponentials was
119310~003919~because of the fact that their I can functions of linear time-invariant
123229~001221~systems
124450~004440~in other words if you have a complex exponential
128890~004640~into a linear time-invariant system the output is a complex exponential
133530~003240~and the change in complex amplitude
136770~004480~is which corresponds to the frequency response
141250~004180~in fact is what led to the definition of the 48 transform
145430~003130~in particular it is the Fourier transform
148560~003530~up the impulse response well
152090~004070~that said have notions is more or less identical to
156160~003420~the way we motivated the look lost transform
159580~004840~in the continuous-time case in the 48 transforming the continuous-time case
164420~004349~and just as in continuous-time there
168769~003610~it are a set signals more general
172379~003251~then the complex exponentials which
175630~003570~are also I can functions have linear time-invariant systems
179200~003810~in particular and discrete-time if
183010~003140~we had instead love an exponential
186150~003470~you to the Chi Omega and we had a more general
189620~003410~complex number Z bad
193030~003200~the signals E to the end is also
196230~003290~and I can function up a linear time-invariant system
199520~003810~for any particular Z so
203330~004890~and we can see that by substituting that it to the convolution some
208220~004040~and recognizing again very strongly paralleling the
212260~003540~continuous-time argument head we can
215800~004060~rewrite this factor as Z to the N
219860~003630~the to the minus K and
223490~004160~because it the fact that it's a someone and are some on K
227650~004620~and his term doesn't depend on K we can take that term out
232270~003750~and the conclusion is that if we have
236020~003100~Z to the end as an input that
239120~004220~the output is love the same form times
243340~003330~a factor which depends on C
246670~003580~but of course doesn't depend on k cuz that is
250250~004190~some doubt as we form the summation so in fact
254440~004419~this some Asian corresponds to a complex number
258859~003120~which will do no as agency
261979~006601~where Z will represent a more general complex number
268580~003459~namely see is are
272039~004361~you to the jail maker are being the magnitude of this complex number
276400~004780~and Omega of course being the angle so
281180~004630~for linear time-invariant system a more general
285810~003829~complex exponential sequence up this form
289639~004161~generates an output a complex exponential sequence
293800~003440~have the same form with a change in amplitude
297240~003239~which were representing as a gypsy
300479~004240~recognizing the fact that it's going to be a function of what that complex
304719~001340~number is
306059~005170~and this amplitude factor is given by this some Asian
311229~003180~and it is this some Asian which
314409~003711~is defined as busy transform
318120~003960~all the sequence H event
322080~005579~now let me stress that and I'll continue to stress this is the lecture goes on
327659~003590~that much of what we've said is
331249~004560~directly parallel to what we said in the continuous-time case
335809~004021~and what we simply done is to expand
339830~005729~from complex exponentials with a purely imaginary exponent
345559~003811~complex exponential time functions are sequences
349370~004129~that form into one's that have more general
353499~003461~complex exponential factors
356960~003449~now we have a mapping here
360409~003451~from the impulse response to
363860~003919~the Tampa to or the Aiken value
367779~003940~associated with that input and this mapping
371719~004401~is what is referred to as busy transport
376120~003620~so a gypsy is in fact
379740~003329~busy transform of the impulse response
383069~003350~and if we consider applying this mapping
386419~003291~as we did in continuous-time in a similar argument
389710~003199~applying this mapping to a
392909~003880~sequence whether or not it corresponds to the impulse response to the linear
396789~001951~time-invariant system
398740~004259~that leads then to busy transform
402999~003280~love a general sequence XFN
406279~003331~busy transform being defined by
409610~003359~this relationship and again
412969~003081~rotationally will often represent
416050~004690~a time for action and it's the transform through shorthand notation
420740~003039~just indicating that accepts the
423779~005211~is this the transform love accident
428990~003310~alright so we've kind of motivated the development
432300~004259~in a manner exactly identical to what we had done with the a-plus transform
436559~003390~kinda the idea that if you look at the eigen value associated
439949~003000~in with the linear time-invariant system
442949~003740~that essentially generates a mapping between
446689~004521~the sequence impulse system impulse response
451210~003220~and a function of Z and
454430~004419~that corresponds to busy transform here at corresponded to applause transform
458849~004000~in a continuous-time case that same argument
462849~004011~is also the argument the kinda argument that we use
466860~003049~to lead us into before EA transform
469909~004780~originally an once again what you would expect
474689~004120~is dead busy transform has a very close
478809~003010~an important relationship to the Fourier transform
481819~003320~and indeed that relationship turned down
485139~003420~to be more or less identical to
488559~003121~the relationship between the applause transform
491680~003750~in the 48 transforming continuous-time
495430~003199~well let's look at the relationship
498629~003090~for civil what we recognize is
501719~003600~they if we compare
505319~003141~the for EA transform expression
508460~003949~for a sequence and busy transform
512409~003240~expression for the same sequence
515649~004121~dead they involve essentially the same operations
519770~004430~and in fact Cincy is of the form are
524200~003520~e2 the jail maker if we want
527720~003020~this some to look like this some
530740~003170~then that would mean that we would choosy
533910~004860~equal to either the jail maker said another way
538770~004810~busy transform onesie is a to the J Omega
543580~004370~is going to reduce to before EA transform
547950~003590~so we have relationship like the one
551540~003530~again we had between the law applies transforming the forty a transforming
555070~001620~continuous-time
556690~004440~namely dead for certain set values
561130~004850~of the complex variable the transform busy transform reduces
565980~004219~to the Fourier transform so if we have ecstasy
570199~003481~busy transform and we look at that
573680~003899~for see equal to either the jail maker
577579~004070~and sequel to you to jail maker is
581649~003461~similar to saying that we're looking at that for the magnitude of Z
585110~005240~equal to 1 were specifically choosing are equal to one which is the magnitude
590350~003560~see then this is equal to
593910~003390~the four EA transform love the sequence
597300~003099~so busy transform frazee
600399~004060~equal to either J Omega is the Fourier transform
604459~004731~and so this then corresponds to
609190~005800~X love Omega namely the Fourier transform
614990~003670~well we now have ourselves in a similar situation
618660~004150~again to what we had when we talked about the applause transform
622810~003360~namely a notational
626170~004320~awkwardness or inconvenience which we can resolve by simply
630490~003370~re defining some of our notation
633860~003140~in particular the awkwardness relates to the fact that
637000~003990~whereas we've been writing or 48 transforms this way
640990~003060~as external make a if
644050~004479~we were to express XZ and look at it it's equal to either the jail maker
648529~004781~we end up with the independent variable be2 the jail maker
653310~004019~rather than Omega well in fact
657329~004331~the 48 transform is a functional Omega it's also a function to be the jail
661660~000950~maker
662610~003390~and now we can see is dead given
666000~003370~the fact that we want to generalize the four the the
669370~004899~for EA transformed to dizzy transform it's convenient now
674269~003630~to use as notation for the four th
677899~004211~transform exit Z was equal to you DJ Omega
682110~004539~namely are Fourier transforms will now be written as i've indicated here
686649~003440~so just summarizing that our new notation
690089~004141~is dead the independent variable
694230~003490~on the Fourier transform is now
697720~003369~going to be expressed as EJ Omega rather than
701089~003271~as omega its a
704360~004120~minor notational change but I recognize the fact that
708480~005149~its somewhat confusing initially and takes a few minutes to sit down and just
713629~003130~get it straightened out it's very similar to what we did with the
716759~001690~apostrophe in swarm
718449~003890~but let me draw your attention to the fact that
722339~004050~in the applause transform the independent variable that we ended up
726389~001651~with
728040~003229~in talking about the 48 transform
731269~003411~is different then what we're ending up with here
734680~003130~in particular before we head J Omega
737810~003630~now we have the to the jail make
741440~004300~and the reason for that is simply that
745740~004120~the whereas in continuous time we were talking about functions are the four
749860~003599~you to the st. now we're talking about
753459~004320~sequences the form Z to the end
757779~004531~alright so in we have one relationship between the four EA transform and dizzy
762310~001649~transform namely
763959~003300~the fact that for the magnitude is equal to 1
767259~006091~busy transform reduces to the Fourier transform
773350~004130~now in the applause transform we also had another important relationship an
777480~001270~observation
778750~004470~which was the fact that the
783220~003190~applause transform was
786410~004429~the Fourier transform love x50
790839~003420~modified and how is a modified it was modified
794259~003601~by multiplying by a decaying
797860~003370~growing exponentially depending on what the real part a veces
801230~004209~well we have a very similar situation with dizzy transform
805439~004010~in particular in addition to the fact
809449~004200~that busy transform for a sequel the DJ Omega
813649~003560~reduces to the four EA transform we'll see
817209~003560~that this is a transform for other values as the
820769~003250~is the Fourier transform love
824019~003951~the sequence with an exponential weighting and let's see where that comes
827970~002239~from
830209~005021~here we have the expression general expression for the transform
835230~005399~and recognizing that see is a complex number which were expressing in polar
840629~000760~form
841389~003310~as are you to the jail maker
844699~003990~substituting that in this summation now becomes
848689~003551~exit Van are you to jail make it to the minus an
852240~004589~we can factor out these two turns are to the minus and
856829~003961~and into the minus J Omega and and
860790~003589~combining the art a minus in with excessive and
864379~003591~and the in the minus J Omega en
867970~003059~being treated separately what we end up with
871029~004550~is the summation that I have here
875579~005601~well what this says is that the z transform which is this
881180~003839~at sea equal to re: to jail maker
885019~004541~is in fact the four EA transform
889560~003649~allo what
893209~003680~it's the Fourier transform our love xom.n
896889~003711~multiplied by art to the -10
900600~003599~so that is the expression
904199~004050~that we have here and in continuous-time
908249~003250~we had the applause transform is the Fourier transform
911499~004200~love X 50 you to the minus Sigma T
915699~006060~here we have the Fourier transform effective and art to the -10
921759~003051~now something to just reflect on for a minute
924810~005170~is the bit because it tends to cause
929980~003729~little better problem with the algebra later on if
933709~003521~your attention is drawn to it is that we're talking about multiplying
937230~001669~excessive and
938899~005040~times are to the minus n the question is
943939~004250~for are greater than one
948189~004710~bizarre to -10 increase exponentially as N increases
952899~004781~it is a decrease we're talking about are to the minus and
957680~003519~if the matter if are is greater than one of the magnitude of ours greater than
961199~000971~one for example
962170~004609~if it's equal to 2 are the minus and is a half to the N
966779~004990~and so in fact that decreases exponentially or more generally
971769~004091~the larger re: is the faster are to the -10
975860~005180~DK's with increasing in
981040~003269~okay well let's just look at
984309~004161~some examples love the the transform
988470~003150~and examples that I picked again
991620~004449~are examples directly out of the text and so
996069~003260~the details of the algebra you can
999329~004961~look at more leisurely as you sit with the textbook
1004290~003909~let's consider first the ball an exponential sequence x7
1008199~004570~equals a to the N times unit step so zero for negative time
1012769~003440~and an exponential for positive time
1016209~003440~in and the Fourier transform as we've seen in
1019649~003360~earlier lectures is won over one minus a
1023009~003541~it to the minus jail maker but
1026550~003730~this doesn't always converge in particular for convergence of the
1030280~001750~Fourier transform
1032030~004750~we would require absolute some ability up the original sequence
1036780~003409~and that in turn requires that the magnitude have a
1040189~004831~be less than 1 so the Fourier transform is this
1045020~003130~provided that the magnitude have a is less than one
1048150~006180~and what is the Fourier transform if the magnitude a vase not less than 1
1054330~005750~well the answer is that in that case it doesn't converge
1060080~004000~right now let's look at the Z transform busy transform
1064080~006280~is the some from minus infinity plus infinity
1070360~003810~Aug a to the N see the -10
1074170~005010~times a unit staff the unit step will change the lower limit 20
1079180~005840~so some from zero to infinity and this is all the form
1085020~003210~eight times
1088230~003250~Z to the -1 to the N
1091480~004880~so we're summing from zero to infinity eight times even minus 12 the N
1096360~006040~that some is one over one minus AZ the -1
1102400~004580~but in order for that song to converge
1106980~003350~we require that the magnitude have a
1110330~005360~time see the -1 be less than 1
1115690~005610~now this is busy transform is the Fourier transform
1121300~004110~love the sequence a to the N
1125410~003430~times are to the -10 and
1128840~003780~this statement about busy transforming converging
1132620~005550~see transform converging is exactly identical to the statement
1138170~003700~that what we're requiring is there the magnet too
1141870~004000~%uh a times art to the -1
1145870~003560~be less than 1 where
1149430~003470~this represents the exponential factor
1152900~003060~that we have are that
1155960~004140~in effect is applied to the sequence so that
1160100~003910~the 48 transform becomes the transform and
1164010~005050~so if we put this condition we can interpret this condition
1169060~003720~in exactly the same way day we interpret the condition
1172780~003340~on convergence of the 48 transform
1176120~003050~right so from this six
1179170~003560~from what we've worked out here then well we have
1182730~003230~is the see transform or
1185960~003230~a to the N times you have an is
1189190~003550~won over one minus AZ the -1
1192740~003550~that works for any bad you have a
1196290~005270~provided that we pick the value Z correctly
1201560~004370~in particular we have to pick the center values UVC
1205930~004470~so that what so that the magnitude obey
1210400~003200~time 0 -1 is less than one
1213600~003200~or equivalently so that the magnitude of the
1216800~003680~is greater than the magnitude a so
1220480~003240~Associated with busy transform
1223720~004480~of this sequence is this algebraic expression
1228200~004630~and this set of values on C for which data algebraic expression is valid
1232830~004200~and just as with the apostrophe its form
1237030~004840~this range values is referred to as
1241870~004110~the region of convergence love busy transform
1245980~004000~now again
1249980~003880~as we saw with the apostrophe s form it's important
1253860~003010~to recognize dead in specifying
1256870~003100~or having worked out the
1259970~004600~d trance 4ever sequence it's not just the algebraic expression
1264570~003870~but also the region of convergence that's required
1268440~003260~to uniquely specified
1271700~005800~to emphasize that further here is example ten-point to from the text
1277500~004860~and if you work that went through what you find is that algebraically
1282360~003470~busy transform love this sequence
1285830~004300~is 101 minus AZ the -1
1290130~004210~identical algebraically to what we had up here
1294340~006630~but now with a region of convergence
1300970~004250~which is the magnitude of the less than the magnitude have a
1305220~003180~in contrast to this example
1308400~003880~where the regional convergence was the magnitude of the
1312280~003550~greater than the magnitude day
1315830~004910~alright so again requires not just the algebraic expression
1320740~003460~but also requires specification
1324200~003020~the region of convergence and
1327220~003300~also as with the applause transform
1330520~003100~it's convenient in looking at
1333620~004040~the z transform to
1337660~004680~represented in the complex plane
1342340~003390~in this case the complex plane referred to as the
1345730~004440~seaplane whereas in continuous time we talked about the applause transform it
1350170~001210~was the S point
1351380~003590~Z of course because he is the complex variable interns in which were
1354970~002000~representing the sea transport
1356970~003510~so we will be representing
1360480~003540~the z transform interns of
1364020~003460~representations in the complex plane
1367480~003060~real part an imaginary part
1370540~004190~but I've also identified a circle here
1374730~003000~and you could wonder well what's the significance
1377730~003110~the circle recall
1380840~004330~dead in the discussion that we just came from
1385170~005620~when we talked about the relationship between is a transforming the 48
1390790~001400~transform
1392190~003290~busy transform reduces to the Fourier transform
1395480~004150~when the magnitude of Z's equal to 1
1399630~003990~the magnitude is equal to 1 in the complex plane is a circle
1403620~003990~and that circle in fact is a circle love radius
1407610~003740~1 and so its on this contour
1411350~003300~in the seaplane that busy transform
1414650~006570~reduces to the 48 transform and we'll see some additional significance to that
1421220~004930~as we go along just again emphasize the relationship since
1426150~004990~and differences with continuous-time with the a-plus transform is the
1431140~002810~behavior in the ass playing on the J Omega axis
1433950~003020~dead corresponds to
1436970~005150~the Fourier transform here its the behavior on the unit circle
1442120~004870~with busy transform corresponds to the Fourier transform
1446990~004330~now we'll be talking as we did with a plus transform
1451320~003790~we'll be talking very often about
1455110~004640~transforms which are rational at and rational transfers as we kiss
1459750~003550~was we'll see represent systems
1463300~004020~which are characterized by linear cut the coefficient difference equations
1467320~003340~and so 4
1470660~003460~the rational transfer for the rational see transforms
1474120~003910~will again find it convenient to use a representation
1478030~003900~interns opposes zeros and dizzy play so let's
1481930~003540~in look at are example as we worked it out
1485470~003160~previously example ten-point 1 and
1488630~003080~with this sequence
1491710~004570~busy transformers one divided by one minus AZ the -1
1496280~004320~and we happen to have written it as a function of Z to the -1
1500600~004950~clearly we can rewrite this by multiplying
1505550~004970~numerator and denominator by Z and this would equivalent leave NBC divided by
1510520~002060~see minus a
1512580~004780~and so if we were to represent this
1517360~006080~through a poll 0 plot we would have 0 at the arch in corresponding this factor
1523440~003030~and a poll at Z equals a
1526470~003470~corresponding to the denominator factor and
1529940~003140~so the poll 0 pattern for this
1533080~003010~is then a poll it's equal to a
1536090~004090~and 0 at the origin
1540180~003540~now let me just comment quickly about the fact that we wrote
1543720~003940~that we've written this as one over one minus AZ the -1
1547660~004630~and it seems kinda strange because perhaps we should have multiplied
1552290~001770~through by C
1554060~003010~%uh let me just indicate dead
1557070~005520~as you'll see as you work examples it's very typical for busy transform
1562590~004070~to come out as a function %uh Zeta -1
1566660~003850~and so very typically you'll get to recognize
1570510~004320~dead things will be expressed in terms of factors involving
1574830~004380~terms like one minus AZ the -1 rather than
1579210~004660~factors are the foreign C-minus a alright well
1583870~004880~here is the one example that we heard referred to
1588750~003920~and if we consider another example
1592670~003280~the other example which was example 10.22
1595950~003540~consists love
1599490~004150~a an algebraic expression as i indicate here
1603640~004670~but its region %uh validity is the magnitude is the less than the magnitude
1608310~000900~have a
1609210~003140~and that corresponds to the same poll 0
1612350~003020~apply but a region of convergence
1615370~003180~which is inside this circle
1618550~004990~whereas in the previous case
1623540~003820~with the poll 0 plot we had a region of convergence
1627360~004250~which was for the magnitude at sea greater than the magnitude have a
1631610~003550~so these two examples this one and the other one
1635160~004700~have exactly the same poll 0 pattern and their distinguished by
1639860~003950~their regional convergence now
1643810~005090~notice incidently that in this particular case
1648900~003930~the region of convergence includes the unit circle provided that
1652830~003990~the magnitude have a is less than one and so in fact
1656820~003950~that would say dead the sequence
1660770~004510~has 48 transform that converges namely with the magnitude see
1665280~004650~equal to 1 whereas in this example
1669930~004230~the regional convergence does not include the unit circle
1674160~005420~and so in fact we cannot look at Exit see for the magnitude is equal to 1
1679580~004090~and so this example with the magnitude have a less than 1
1683670~004260~does not have a Fourier transform the convergence
1687930~004240~well assuming that the bank to give a is less than one
1692170~003790~and the Fourier transform converges we can in fact
1695960~003610~look at the Fourier transform by
1699570~004860~observing what happens as we go around the unit circle
1704430~003920~we've seen as for the a-plus transform interns observing what happened as we
1708350~002050~move along the jail make axis
1710400~003730~and here again we can use
1714130~003180~the vectors
1717310~003770~as we trace out the unit circle
1721080~003600~and in particular what we would be looking at in this case
1724680~003330~is the ratio of the zero vector
1728010~006180~to the polls actor for example if we were looking at the magnitude busy
1734190~001080~transform
1735270~005620~the magnitude is a transform with the the ratio the like that this factor
1740890~003100~to the like that this specter
1743990~004120~and to observe the Fourier transform we would observe
1748110~003350~how those vectors change in length
1751460~003590~as we move around the unit circle
1755050~003880~and as we move around the unit circle what we were trace out
1758930~003480~interns the ratio the lights are those vectors is
1762410~004200~the for EA transform
1766610~004510~okay well let's focus
1771120~003250~on that also in the context
1774370~005630~love a slightly different the transforming dizzy transform here
1780000~005450~as we'll see in later lecture is this the transform associated with the
1785450~000980~second-order
1786430~004320~difference equation it's a it has a denominator factor which has
1790750~004030~which has two poles associated with it
1794780~003350~and so here if we assumed
1798130~004190~that the forty a transformer The Associated sequence
1802320~003440~converge then again we would look
1805760~003970~at the behavior this as we moved around the unit circle
1809730~004740~and the ratio the links at the appropriate vectors
1814470~004590~would describe 4s the frequency response
1819060~003330~I'm sorry the Fourier transform so
1822390~004870~the Fourier transform magnitude would consist the
1827260~003110~the ratio the lengths
1830370~004580~above the zero vectors divided by the links to the poll vectors
1834950~003490~and one thing that we observe is dead
1838440~004000~as we move in frequency Omega in the vicinity
1842440~003790~love this poll this poll fact there in fact
1846230~003990~reaches a minimum length that would mean
1850220~003600~there'd its reciprocal would be maximum
1853820~004640~and then as we sweep past the lysate these two vectors would increase the
1858460~001740~zero vector is a course
1860200~003530~would retain the same way no matter where we were
1863730~005660~on the unit circle so in fact if we look at the Fourier transform associated with
1869390~002100~this poll 0 pattern
1871490~003090~if this was for example the the
1874580~003460~for EA the represented the the
1878040~003540~see transform or the impulse response
1881580~004720~the linear time-invariant system the corresponding frequency response
1886300~003980~would be what I plotted out below and so
1890280~003180~it would peak and in fact where it would peak
1893460~006400~is in the vicinity above the frequency location of the poll
1899860~006100~as I indicate up here
1905960~003360~so as we sweep past is this poll
1909320~003240~then in fact this 48 transform
1912560~003090~peaks well
1915650~004190~this notion love looking at the frequency response as we move around the
1919840~001340~unit circle
1921180~005000~is a very important notion and it's important to recognize that is the unit
1926180~002980~circle that we're talking about here whereas before
1929160~003520~we were talking about the jail major axis
1932680~003350~and to emphasize this further
1936030~003250~let me just show this example and in fact
1939280~003090~the previous example with the
1942370~004000~computer display so that we can see the frequency response
1946370~004750~as it sweeps out as we go around the unit circle
1951120~004390~so here we have the poll 0 pattern
1955510~005620~for the second-order example and to generate the Fourier transform
1961130~005300~we want to look at the behavior of the polling 0 vectors as we move around the
1966430~001330~unit circle
1967760~003460~so first let's display the vectors
1971220~003070~and here we have them displayed to
1974290~003570~the point corresponding to zero frequency
1977860~004960~and the magnitude of the Fourier transform
1982820~004540~will be as we discussed the magnet to the like that this 0 factors divided by
1987360~002640~the magnitude of the like that the poll vectors
1990000~004400~shown below will be the for EA transform
1994400~003420~and we have the Fourier transform displayed
1997820~003370~hear from 0 to 2pi rather than
2001190~004300~from mine despite supply as it was displayed in the transparency
2005490~003250~because the periodicity the Fourier transform
2008740~003690~both those are acquittal
2012430~004230~now we're sweeping away from I'll make equal 0
2016660~003920~and the lengths on the pole vectors have changed
2020580~003110~and that of course generates a change in
2023690~003460~the 48 transform and
2027150~003580~as we continue the process further
2030730~003290~if we increase frequency
2034020~004950~as we sweep closer to the location at the pole
2038970~004090~the polls actor decreases in length dramatically
2043060~003980~and net generates a residence in the 48 transform
2047040~003490~very similar to what we saw in continuous-time
2050530~003280~now as we continue to sweep
2053810~003420~further what will happen is that
2057230~004820~that poll factor will begin to increase in like that again
2062050~004730~and so in fact the magnitude of the Fourier transform
2066780~003539~will decrease and we see that here
2070319~004931~as we sweep toward or making equal to pie
2075250~003629~now notice in this process that the
2078879~003270~like that the zero vector is has stayed the same
2082149~003401~because the fact that this 0 the zeros
2085550~005089~are at the origin and no matter where we are in the unit circle the like that
2090639~001790~those factors is unity
2092429~003960~so they don't influence in this example the magnitude but they would of course
2096389~003031~influence the face
2099420~003880~now we want to continue sweeping from make people to pie
2103300~004650~around to 2pi and because the symmetry in the Fourier transform
2107950~004360~what we will see in the magnitude is identical to what we would see
2112310~003690~if we swept from a geek with the pie back
2116000~003650~clockwise who are making equal 0
2119650~003290~in particular now as we're increasing frequency
2122940~003260~notice that the link love the poll
2126200~004560~vector associated with the lower half plane poll is decreasing
2130760~003040~and so in fact that corresponds to
2133800~003550~to generating a residence as
2137350~005270~we sweep past that polo cation as we are here
2142620~003360~and then finally that poll factor increases in Lang
2145980~003820~as we begin to approach will make people to 2pi
2149800~007000~or equivalent Lee as we approach Omega equal to 0
2159380~004200~no finally let's also look at
2163580~003700~the for EA transform associated with
2167280~004060~the first order example that we discussed earlier in the lecture
2171340~005430~and so what we wanted look at is the four EA transform as the poll
2176770~003130~n0 vectors change once again
2179900~004420~the Fourier transform will be displayed on a scale from 0 to 2pi
2184320~004750~frequency scale from 0 to 2pi rather than mine despite a pie
2189070~004490~and we want to observe the poll n0 vectors as we sweep around the unit
2193560~005170~circle
2198730~003320~we display first the poll n0 vectors
2202050~003680~at Omega equal to 0 and
2205730~004580~as the frequency increases
2210310~003630~the polls vector increases in length
2213940~003540~zero vector since the zeros at the origin
2217480~005000~will have constantly no matter where we are on the unit circle although it would
2222480~003530~affect the phase which we are not displaying here
2226010~004260~and so the principal affect the only affect really in the magnitude
2230270~003810~is due to the poll vector as the frequency
2234080~003370~continues to increase the poll vector
2237450~003030~increases in length monotonically
2240480~003940~in fact and so that means that the magnitude
2244420~004790~above the 48 transform will decrease monotonically
2249210~007000~until we get past Omega equal to pie
2264840~003640~here we are now at Omega equal to pie
2268480~004210~and when we continue sweeping past
2272690~003480~this frequency around to 2pi then
2276170~004040~we will see basically the same curve swept out
2280210~003010~in reverse sense because the symmetry
2283220~004370~again if the 48 transform magnitude sweeping from
2287590~003330~hi tu Pai is going to be equivalent
2290920~003690~with regard to the magnitude too sweeping from pie
2294610~003820~back to zero and so now
2298430~003920~the poll vector begins to decrease in length and
2302350~003930~correspondingly the magnitude of the Fourier transform
2306280~003540~will increase and
2309820~004390~that will continue until we get around to make people to 2pi
2314210~003150~which is equivalent of course will make people 0
2317360~004950~and obviously if we continue to sweep around again we would simply
2322310~003920~trace out other periods associated with
2326230~007000~the forty a transport
2335580~003160~well that hopefully gives you care some feel for
2338740~004500~for the notion I love %uh sweeping around the unit circle and of course you
2343240~000880~can see that
2344120~003210~dead because the circle is periodic
2347330~004050~as we go around and around of course what would get is a periodic for EA
2351380~001430~transform which is
2352810~004770~the way for EA transforms are supposed to be now
2357580~004100~the just is
2361680~003830~with the Laplace transform the
2365510~003430~region of convergence that the transform
2368940~003910~as we've seen in this example and
2372850~004530~is a very important part the specification
2377380~003340~above busy transform and we can
2380720~003170~in talking about sequences near transforms either
2383890~003880~specify the regional convergence implicitly or we can't specify
2387770~001160~explicitly
2388930~003500~we can for example say what it is says
2392430~003300~let's say the magnitude easy being greater than the magnitude a
2395730~004250~or we can recognize that the region of convergence
2399980~003620~has certain constraints associated with
2403600~004500~certain properties love the time function and
2408100~003670~in particular there are
2411770~004070~some important properties love the region of convergence
2415840~003460~which allow us given
2419300~003220~bed we know certain characteristics at the time function
2422520~003000~to then identify the region of convergence
2425520~003400~by looking at the poll 0 pad for example
2428920~003100~we recognize that the region of convergence
2432020~004860~does not contain any polls because the fact that at polls
2436880~003230~busy transform in fact blows up
2440110~004830~and of course can converge at that point furthermore
2444940~003570~the region of convergence consists love a ring
2448510~003460~in the seaplane centered about the origin
2451970~003240~recall there with a plus transform
2455210~003630~the regional convergence consisted of strips in
2458840~006380~the S plane with the sea transform the region of convergence consist suffering
2465220~003460~basically because if the fact that the regional convergence
2468680~004560~is dependent on the magnitude of Z whereas
2473240~003960~with a plus transform the region of convergence was dependent on the real
2477200~000860~party vez
2478060~003330~the fact that is the magnitude of the says
2481390~004060~in effect dead all values see that have the same magnitude
2485450~004290~lie on a circle and so the regional convergence you would expect
2489740~004180~to be a concentric ring
2493920~005740~in the seaplane furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited
2499660~004140~actually convergence %uh the Fourier transform
2503800~003660~is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence
2507460~005260~includes the unit circle in the play now
2512720~005380~in we can also associate the region of convergence with issues
2518100~003640~about whether the sequence is a finite duration
2521740~003590~alright cited or left-sided in and
2525330~003740~let's let me sir quickly indicate again
2529070~003950~what this I love the argument is if
2533020~003710~we have a finite duration sequence so that
2536730~004540~the sequence is absolutely solvable and therefore has a Fourier transform that
2541270~001050~converges
2542320~005070~then because of the fact dead it 0 outside some interval
2547390~004060~I can multiply it by an exponentially
2551450~005670~decaying sequence or by an exponentially growing sequence
2557120~003740~and since I'm only doing is over a finite interval
2560860~003950~no matter how I choose that exponential will end up
2564810~003090~with an absolutely some herbal product so
2567900~004960~if accident is a finite duration that in fact the region of convergence
2572860~003560~is the entire seaplane possibly
2576420~006520~with the exception of the origin or insanity on the other hand
2582940~005250~if the sequence is a right-sided sequence
2588190~003540~then we have to be careful that we don't
2591730~004140~multiply by an exponential that grows too fast
2595870~003330~for positive time or equivalent Lee in
2599200~003660~we have to might have to choose the exponential so that
2602860~003850~it DK sufficiently fast for positive time
2606710~004150~as a consequence if that for a right-sided sequence
2610860~005230~if we have a value which is in the region of convergence
2616090~003300~as long as I multiply by exponentials
2619390~003290~that DK faster than that for positive time
2622680~003320~then also have
2626000~004170~convergence in other words all finite values Z
2630170~003630~to which the magnitude it sees greater than this so that the exponentials die
2633800~001700~of even faster
2635500~003800~will also be in the region of convergence
2639300~003400~if we combine that statement with the fact that there are no polls
2642700~004160~in the region of convergence then we end up with a statement similar to what we
2646860~002100~had with the applause transform
2648960~005470~here the statement is dead if the sequences right-sided
2654430~003470~then the regional convergence
2657900~004400~has to be outside the outermost poll essentially because it has to be outside
2662300~004930~someplace and can include any polls
2667230~003610~finally if we have
2670840~003340~a left-sided sequence
2674180~004800~van the if we have a value which is in the region convergence
2678980~003260~all values for which the magnitude see is less than that
2682240~004930~will also be in the region of convergence or if ecstasy is rational
2687170~003930~then the region of convergence must be inside the innermost poll
2691100~004630~and finally if we have a two-sided sequence
2695730~003130~then this kind of a balance between
2698860~004380~the exponential factor that we use and so in that case
2703240~003390~then the region of convergence will be ring
2706630~004420~in the seaplane and a essentially will extend outward to a poll
2711050~003680~an inward to a poll so if we had
2714730~004220~an algebraic expression let's say as
2718950~003600~in we have here
2722550~003730~in then
2726280~004690~we can associate with that a region of convergence outside this poll
2730970~003800~and that would correspond to a right-sided sequence
2734770~004810~or we can associate it with it a region of convergence
2739580~004260~which is inside
2743840~004620~the innermost poll and that would correspond to a left-sided sequence
2748460~003950~and the third and only other possibility
2752410~003070~is a region of convergence which
2755480~003610~lies between these two poles and
2759090~003920~that would then correspond to a two-sided sequence
2763010~003210~noticed incidentally because that way right place these polls
2766220~003950~that this is the only one for which the regional convergence includes the unit
2770170~000980~circle
2771150~006050~in other words it's the only one for which the Fourier transform convergence
2777200~003860~okay now we move through that fairly quickly and
2781060~004280~a I've emphasize the fact that it parallels very closely what we did
2785340~003350~with the a-plus transform what I'd like to do
2788690~003450~is just conclude with a discussion of
2792140~003810~how we get the time function back again
2795950~006120~when we have busy transform including its regional convergence
2802070~004530~well we can first the ball develop a more less formal expression
2806600~004850~and the algebra for this is going through in the text and you went through
2811450~001120~something similar
2812570~005270~to this with the applause transform in the video course manual so I won't carry
2817840~001500~through the details
2819340~005830~but basically well we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact
2825170~004100~that dizzy transform is the Fourier transform
2829270~004000~the sequence exponentially weighted so we can apply the inverse
2833270~003000~transformed to that and
2836270~003450~that gives is not active and protective an exponentially weighted
2839720~004090~and if we track that through then what we'll end up with
2843810~003970~is an expression after we've taken care of
2847780~004060~few the app's lines and deltas will end up with an expression
2851840~003000~that expresses formally
2854840~003380~the sequence XFN interns
2858220~003400~love busy transform where
2861620~003770~this in fact is a cock to her in a goal in the complex plane
2865390~003290~and so there's a formal expression just
2868680~003600~as there's a formal expression for the apostrophe its form
2872280~003820~but in fact the more typical procedure is
2876100~005520~to use essentially transform pairs that we know
2881620~005750~together with the idea of using a partial fraction expansion
2887370~006030~so if we had a sequence if we had a see transformers I indicate here
2893400~003570~and if we expanded out
2896970~003430~in a partial fraction expansion
2900400~003160~then weekend recognize as
2903560~004320~we did in a similar style with the lip gloss transform
2907880~003730~we can recognize dead each term
2911610~005250~together with the identified region of convergence
2916860~003320~corresponds to an exponential factor
2920180~005740~and so this term together with the fact that we know that the magnitude of C
2925920~003130~must be greater than to allows us
2929050~003190~to recognize this as similar to
2932240~004490~the example ten-point 1 and in particular than
2936730~004220~the sequence associated with that is what I indicate here
2940950~003270~and for the second term the sequence is
2944220~003420~what I indicate here so
2947640~003490~what we're simply doing is using the fact that
2951130~003640~we've worked out big the example going one direction before
2954770~004460~and now we use that together with the partial fraction expansion
2959230~003820~to get the individual sequences back again
2963050~003800~and then at them together is one other method which I'll just point to
2966850~004560~which eg is also elaborated on a little more in the text
2971410~004430~but it's kind of the idea I love developing the inverse
2975840~003080~Z transformed by recognizing dead
2978920~003650~this the transformer formula
2982570~004340~in fact is a power series
2986910~004150~so if we take exigency
2991060~003100~and expanded into power series
2994160~004540~then we can pick of the values affect the van
2998700~003610~by identifying the individual coefficients
3002310~003230~in this expansion
3005540~005880~okay and so by simply doing long division for example
3011420~003300~we can also get the inverse transform
3014720~004290~and that by the way is very useful particularly
3019010~003500~if we want to get the inverse see transform
3022510~004950~for z transform expression which is not rational
3027460~004670~right now we move through this fairly quickly on the other hand I stress
3032130~004950~dead it's very similar to what we went through for the applause transform
3037080~001130~except
3038210~003140~for a very important difference
3041350~004850~the principal difference really being that with a plus transform it was the J
3046200~002390~Omega axis and the S plane
3048590~004390~that we focused attention on when we're thinking about the Fourier transform
3052980~005680~here the unit circle in the seaplane plays an important role
3058660~004950~well we'll see when we continue this in the next lecture is dead
3063610~003640~there are properties are busy transform
3067250~003350~just as they were properties of us transform
3070600~003240~and those properties allow us
3073840~003000~to develop and exploit
3076840~003180~busy transform in the context love
3080020~003150~systems describable by when your constant coefficient difference
3083170~001070~equations
3084240~003300~so in the next lecture will focus on
3087540~003660~some properties busy transform and then we'll see
3091200~003040~how to use those properties to help us
3094240~003780~in getting further insight and working with system
3098020~002860~describe a wall by difference equations thank you
