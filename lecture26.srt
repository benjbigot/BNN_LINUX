the new the last time

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,580 
we began a discussion feedback

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,220 
and I briefly introduce the number
applications for example

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,100 
the user feedback in compensating for
non-ideal elements in a system

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,369 
and also is another example

16
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,890 
the user feedback in stabilizing
unstable systems

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,649 
in this final lecture what I'd like to
do

18
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,700 
is focus in more detail on the user
feedback

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,369 
to stabilize unstable systems and the
specific context in which I'd like to do

20
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:28,860 
that

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,060 
is in the context love the inverted
pendulum now

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,270 
i've referred to the inverted pendulum
in several

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,509 
past lectures and basically as everyone
realizes

24
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,840 
a pendulum is essentially a ride with
the weight on the bottom

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,350 
and naturally an inverted pendulum is
just that upside down

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,119 
and so it's essentially a ride that's
top-heavy

27
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,619 
and the idea with the inverted pendulum

28
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,649 
is although by itself

29
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,830 
its unstable around a pivot point at the
bottom

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,530 
the idea is to applying external input
an acceleration

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,380 
essentially to keep it balanced and
we've all

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,520 
probably done this type of thing at some
point in our lives

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,060 
either childhood or not and so that's

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,940 
the system that I'd like to analyze and
then

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,780 
illustrate in this lecture now the
context

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,420 
in which will do that is not with my
son's

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,819 
course but actually with an inverted
pendulum

38
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,220 
which is mounted on a card and first I'd
like to go through an analysis of it and

39
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,700 
then

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,330 
will actually see how the system works
well basically then

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,410 
the system that we're talking about is

42
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,810 
going to be a system which is a movable
card

43
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,090 
mountains on the card is

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,420 
a ride with the weight on the top and
this then becomes the inverted pendulum

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,280 
and the cart has

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,600 
and external acceleration apply to it
which

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,010 
is the input that we can apply to the
system

48
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,520 
and then in general we can expect some
disturbances and I'm gonna represent the

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,570 
disturbances

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,350 
interns love and angular acceleration

51
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,370 
which shows up around the wait at the
top of the rock

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,000 
so if we look at the system then

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,250 
as I've kinda indicated it here
basically we have

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,450 
two inputs we have

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,640 
an input which are the external
disturbances

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,040 
which we can assume that we have no
control over

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,750 
and then their is the acceleration

58
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,910 
thats applied to the cart: externally or
in the case so

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,680 
balancing my son's course it's the
movement my hand

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,440 
and then through the system dynamics

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,720 
that ends up influencing the

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,540 
angle of the ride and will think

63
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,260 
love the anchor the angle of the ride as

64
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,270 
the system output and basically the idea
then

65
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,250 
is to try to keep that angle at zero

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,289 
by applying the appropriate acceleration
now

67
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,360 
as i've mentioned several times
previously if

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,650 
we know exactly what the system dynamics
are

69
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,430 
and if we know exactly what the external
disturbances are

70
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,080 
then theoretically we can choose an
acceleration

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,319 
for the card which will exactly balance
the system

72
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,819 
or balance the ride however says the
system is inherently unstable

73
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:47,610 
any deviation from that model in
particular any

74
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,270 
unanticipated external disturbances will
excite the instability

75
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,430 
and what that means is that the rival
for

76
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,099 
so the idea then is

77
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,749 
as we'll see to stabilize the system

78
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,159 
by placing feedback a rounded in
particular

79
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,039 
by through measurement the output angle

80
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,490 
process through some appropriate
feedback dynamics

81
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,710 
using Matt to control deceleration

82
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,639 
the cart and if we choose the feedback
dynamics correctly

83
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,650 
then in fact we can end up with

84
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,719 
a stable system even though the
open-loop system is unstable

85
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:35,900 
well as a first step let's analyze the
system in its open loop form

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,069 
their particular let's analyze the
system without feedback

87
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:43,870 
demonstrate dead indeed it is unstable
and then

88
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,639 
see how we can stabilize using feedback

89
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,759 
so the system then is

90
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,169 
as we've indicated the variables
involved

91
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,689 
are the measured angle which represents
the output

92
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,939 
the acceleration angular acceleration
due to external disturbances

93
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,249 
and then there is the applied external

94
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,059 
acceleration on the card so these
represent the variables with

95
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:15,520 
lol representing the link to the rod and

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,150 
SFT I indicate here which we won't
really be paying attention to

97
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,229 
as the position of the card

98
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,999 
and without going into the details

99
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,279 
specifically what we'll do is

100
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,749 
set up the equation to write the
equation in terms of balancing the

101
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:34,300 
accelerations

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,620 
and if you go through that process then

103
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,979 
the basic equation that you end up with
is

104
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,740 
the equation that I indicate here and

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,659 
this equation then tells us how the
basic forces are accelerations a balance

106
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,879 
where this is the second derivative or

107
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,639 
the angle and then we have

108
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,319 
deceleration due to gravity reflected
through

109
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,949 
the angular acceleration times sign

110
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,539 
love the angle the angular acceleration

111
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,150 
due to the external disturbances and
finally

112
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,059 
the angular acceleration due to the
motion the cart

113
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,939 
now this equation is written here is a
nonlinear equation

114
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,509 
in the angle say to T and

115
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,089 
what we'd like to do is linearized
equation

116
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,279 
and really arise the equation by making
the assumption

117
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,639 
dead the angle is very small close to
zero

118
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,059 
no other words what will assume is that
we're able to keep

119
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,909 
the rod relatively vertical and our
analysis

120
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,779 
because we're winning a rise in the
equations will obviously depend on that

121
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,210 
so making the assumption that the angle
is small

122
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,270 
we then assuming that the sign up the
angle is approximately equal to the

123
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,279 
angle

124
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,309 
and the cosine the angle is

125
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:04,990 
approximately equal to 1 that will then
linearized this equation

126
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,309 
and the resulting equation then

127
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:13,339 
in its linearis form is the one that I
indicate here

128
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,400 
so we have an equation emotion which

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,270 
which linearis is the balances the
accelerations

130
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,789 
and what we see on the right hand side
of the equation

131
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,110 
is the combined inputs

132
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,680 
due to the angular acceleration of the
ride and the acceleration of the card

133
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,250 
and on the left hand side of the
equation we have

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,399 
the other forces due to the changing the
angle

135
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,270 
so this is Dan the differential
equations Associated

136
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,910 
with the open-loop system the basic
dynamics at the system

137
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,120 
and if we apply the law applies
transform to this equation

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,760 
and solve for the system function than

139
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,440 
the basic equation that were left with
expresses

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,880 
the applause transformer the angle

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,180 
equal to the system function the
open-loop system function

142
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,740 
times the applies transform all the
combined in points

143
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,550 
and I remind you again that are sumptin
is that this is an input that we have

144
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,180 
no control over this is the input that
we can control

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,980 
and the two together of course form the
combined input

146
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,280 
now we can of course saw for the poles
and zeros there are

147
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,770 
no zeros and their two polls since this
is the second order denominator

148
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,790 
and looking at the polls in the S plane

149
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,260 
then we see that we have a pair of polls
one

150
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,390 
at minus the square root of G over L and
one

151
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,880 
at plus the square root G over L

152
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,430 
and the important observation and is
dead while

153
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,290 
this poll represents a stable poll

154
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,400 
the right half plane poll represents
unstable pole

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,900 
and so this system in fact is

156
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,130 
unstable system it's unstable because

157
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,400 
what we have is a poll in the right half
plane

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,590 
for the open-loop system

159
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,520 
now before we see how to stabilize the
system what's in fact

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,260 
look at the mechanical setup

161
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,460 
which we I won't turn on for now

162
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,350 
and just see essentially what this
instability means and

163
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,680 
what the physical or irritation at the
equipment is

164
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,960 
so what we have which you just saw a
caricature of

165
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,290 
in a few graph is an inverted pendulum

166
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,220 
this represents the pendulum and

167
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,560 
it's mounted with a pivot point at the
bottom

168
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,000 
it's mounted on a cart and here we have
the card

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,870 
and this is a pivot point

170
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,790 
and as you can see the cart can move
back and forth

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,070 
on a track and the external acceleration

172
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,130 
which is applied to the card is applied
through this cable

173
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,170 
and that cable is controlled

174
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,370 
by motor and we have the motor

175
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,510 
at this ended the track and so

176
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,720 
as the motor turns than the cart will
move back and forth

177
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,190 
okay now since the system

178
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,160 
is not turned on and has no Feedback in
fact

179
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,050 
the system as we just saw in the
transparency is

180
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,530 
unstable system and what then is the
ability means

181
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,670 
is that for example if I

182
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,310 
set the angle 20 and then let it go

183
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,240 
then as soon as there's a slight
external disturbance

184
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,110 
it will start to fall now you can
imagine

185
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,410 
that not only is the system unstable as
it is

186
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,410 
but certainly can't accommodate changes
in the system dynamics for example if we

187
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,170 
change

188
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,770 
let's say the way to the pendulum so we
thought for example

189
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,790 
love changing the wait by let's say

190
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,030 
putting something like a glass with
something in it on

191
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,740 
top and I think about trying to balance
it by itself obviously

192
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,980 
thats part in fact I would say without
turning this system on

193
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,560 
guaranteed to be impossible so

194
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,410 
the basic system as we just analyzed it
is

195
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,710 
inherently an unstable system the
instability reflecting the fact

196
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:46,100 
that the pendulum are following its own
natural forces will tend to fall

197
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,530 
and now what we want to look at is how

198
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,780 
through the use the feedback weekend in
fact

199
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,810 
stabilize the system

200
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,520 
so let's first

201
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,540 
once again look at the

202
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,890 
open-loop system and

203
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,480 
the open-loop system function that we
saw was the system function

204
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,950 
of this form one over LS squared minus G

205
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,080 
and that represents the system function

206
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,260 
Associated with the two inputs one being
the external disturbances

207
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,300 
the other being the externally applied
acceleration

208
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,360 
and the system function here

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,920 
is the represents the system dynamics
and

210
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,660 
the resulting output is the angle

211
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,690 
now the feedback to basic strategy

212
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,070 
behind the feedback is to in some way

213
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,580 
use the measured angle make a
measurement of the angle

214
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,120 
and use that through appropriate
feedback dynamics to stabilize the

215
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,160 
system

216
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,440 
and so with feedback applied around the
system then

217
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,050 
their would be some measurement up the
angle

218
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,560 
through so appropriately chosen feedback
dynamics

219
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,310 
and that dan would determine 4s

220
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,190 
the applied external acceleration
corresponding

221
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,200 
to what the motor does by pulling the
cable back and forth

222
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,260 
and we would like to choose she evas so
that the overall system is stable

223
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,330 
now as you recall from the lecture last
time

224
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,230 
with the feedback around the system
expressed here

225
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,420 
interns have negative feedback the

226
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,470 
overall transfer function then is the
transfer function

227
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,070 
associated with the basic feedback loop
where HFS

228
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:46,070 
is the open-loop system and GFS
corresponds to the feedback dynamics

229
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,690 
now that's the basic strategy we haven't
decided yet

230
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,160 
how to choose the feedback dynamics and
that becomes the next step and we want

231
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,360 
to choose the dynamics in such a way

232
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,820 
that the system ends up being stabilized

233
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,650 
well I think the thing to do is just
simply begin

234
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,620 
with what would seem to be the most
obvious which is

235
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,870 
a simple measurement of the angle let's
take

236
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,880 
the angular measurement feat that back

237
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,900 
let's say through a potentiometer and
perhaps an amplifier so that there's

238
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,950 
some gain

239
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,040 
and see if we can stabilize the system
simply through

240
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,960 
feedback which is proportional to a
measurement of the angle

241
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,840 
what is typically referred to as per for
proportional feedback

242
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,050 
well let's analyze the results

243
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,240 
doing that once again we have

244
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,940 
the basic feedback equation where

245
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,070 
the open-loop transfer function is what
we had

246
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,640 
developed previously given by the
second-order expression

247
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,800 
now using proportional feedback

248
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,300 
we shoes the acceleration

249
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,850 
a hefty to be directly proportional

250
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,840 
through a game constant or attenuation
constant k1

251
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,690 
directly proportional to the measured
angle theta ft

252
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,150 
and consequently the system function in
the feedback

253
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,400 
path is just simply a gainer for
attenuation k1

254
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,240 
so this then is the system function for
the feedback

255
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,720 
well substituting this into the

256
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,740 
closed-loop expression

257
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,970 
then the overall expression for

258
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,700 
the apostrophe its form of the output
angle

259
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,820 
is as i indicated here

260
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,940 
namely that faded ass is

261
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,100 
proportional through this system
function

262
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,190 
to the apostrophe its form love the

263
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,279 
input X 50 and let me remind you that

264
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,730 
X 50 the external disturbances now
represent the only input

265
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,110 
since the other input corresponding to
the applied acceleration so the card

266
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,120 
is now controlled only through the
feedback

267
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,770 
luv so we have this system function then

268
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,339 
for the closed-loop system we recognize
this once again

269
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,900 
as a second-order system and

270
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,140 
the polls both this second order system

271
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,679 
are then given by plus and minus the
square root

272
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,429 
love G minus k1 divided by L

273
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,809 
so k1 the feedback constant

274
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,330 
clearly influences the position at the
polls

275
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,770 
and let's look in fact at where

276
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,409 
the polls are in the S play

277
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:45,690 
well first of all with

278
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,559 
k1 equal to 0 which of course is no
Feedback

279
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,340 
and corresponds to the open-loop system
we have the polls

280
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,430 
where they were previously

281
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,980 
and if we now choose k1 let's say less
than zero

282
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,130 
than what will happen as

283
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,210 
k1 becomes more and more negative

284
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,700 
so that this term is more and more
positive is dead

285
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,890 
the left here plane poll will move
further into the left airplane

286
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,020 
the right half plane poll will move
further into the right half play

287
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,100 
so clearly with K one negative

288
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,150 
this poll which represents an
instability because

289
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,540 
even more unstable well

290
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,740 
instead a K one negative let's try K one
positive and see what happens

291
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,610 
and with k1 positive

292
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,900 
what happens in this case is dead

293
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,700 
the left hip plane poll moves

294
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,450 
closer to the origin the right half
plane poll

295
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,250 
was closer to the origin what one would
hope is that

296
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,420 
they both end up in the left airplane at
some point but in fact they don't

297
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,280 
what happens is that eventually they
both reach the origin

298
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,930 
split at that point and travel along

299
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,870 
the jail make axis now this movement of
the polls

300
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,420 
as we very k1 either positive or
negative

301
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,580 
we all we see is that the open with the
open-loop system

302
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,750 
as we introduce feedback those basic
polls

303
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,780 
move in the ass plane either this way

304
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,460 
as K one becomes more negative or for
this particular case

305
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,970 
K one is positive they move in together
split move along the jail make axes

306
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,590 
and that locus the polls in fact is
referred to

307
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,410 
if the back terminology as the root
locus and as is discussed in

308
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,300 
much more detail on the tax there are
lots of ways

309
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,600 
love determining the root locus for
feedback systems

310
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,250 
without explicitly solving for the roots
for this

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,100 
particular example in fact we can
determine the root locus

312
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,630 
the most straightforward way simply by
song for the roots

313
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,809 
I'll that the nominator the system

314
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,740 
now notice that in this case these polls

315
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,770 
with K one positive have moved together

316
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,880 
they move along the jail make axes and

317
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880 
before they come together the system is
clearly unstable

318
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,970 
even when they come together and split

319
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,470 
the system is marginally stable

320
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,660 
because in fact the system with 10
docile E

321
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,059 
and what that isolation means is that
with the measurement of the angle

322
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,160 
essentially if the polls are operating
on the J Omega axes

323
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,230 
what will happen is that

324
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,940 
things will oscillate back and forth
perhaps with

325
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,040 
the cart moving back and forth trying to
compensate

326
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,880 
and the ride sorta moving in the
opposite direction

327
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,270 
in any case what's happened is with just
proportional feedback

328
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,250 
we apparently are unable to stabilize
the system

329
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,830 
well you could think that the reason
perhaps is that we're not responding

330
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,360 
fast enough for example

331
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,550 
if the angle starts to change

332
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,070 
perhaps in fact we should make the
feedback proportional

333
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,270 
to the rate of change Bengal rather than
to the angle itself

334
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,320 
and so we could examine the possibility
using

335
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,700 
what's referred to as thrifty back

336
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,290 
and derivative feedback what we would do

337
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,160 
is to shoes

338
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,910 
for the feedback equation

339
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,390 
or for the feedback system function

340
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,100 
something reflecting a measurement love
the derivative

341
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,500 
the angle and so here again once again
we have the open-loop

342
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,280 
system function with the river to
feedback will attempt

343
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,040 
to or we will use this feedback

344
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,080 
and acceleration which instead of being
proportional to the angle as it was in

345
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,500 
the previous case

346
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,780 
and acceleration which is proportional
to

347
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:20,450 
the river the ankle and so the basic
feedback dynamics or feedback system

348
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,390 
function

349
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,860 
is their GFS is equal to k to times s

350
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,280 
the multiplication by ass reflecting the
fact that in the time domain

351
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,170 
its measuring the derivative the angle

352
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,500 
The Associated system function is then

353
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,179 
indicated here and if we saw again this
second order equation

354
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,270 
for its roots that tells us that

355
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,390 
the location the polls are given

356
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,820 
by this equation

357
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,110 
and so now what we would want to look at
is

358
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,250 
how these polls mu as we very

359
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,300 
the derivative the back constant k2

360
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,830 
so let's look at the root locus for that
case

361
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,040 
and first once again

362
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,880 
we have the basic open loopholes

363
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,230 
and the open loopholes consists of a
poll on the left half plane and a pole

364
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,600 
in the right half plane

365
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,410 
corresponding in this equation 2k to
equal to 0

366
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,710 
that is no feedback in the system

367
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,190 
if k2 is negative then what you can see
is that

368
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,360 
this real part will become

369
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,929 
more negative since K two squared here

370
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,679 
this is still a positive quantity and in
fact

371
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,940 
then with k2 less than zero the root
locus that we get

372
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,040 
is indicated by this

373
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,260 
now notice then that this right half
plane poll

374
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,630 
is becoming more unstable and

375
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,040 
the left airplane poll likewise is
becoming more unstable

376
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,870 
and this point by the way corresponds to
wear this poll ends up

377
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,679 
or where the root locus ends up went 8-2
eventually becomes infinite

378
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,460 
so clearly k to negative is not going to
stabilize the system

379
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,720 
let's try k2 positive

380
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,500 
and the root locus dictated by this
equation then

381
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,809 
is what I indicate here

382
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,540 
the left half plane poll moves further
into left airplane that's good that's

383
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,080 
getting

384
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,710 
more stable the right half plain polo is
moving

385
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,940 
closer to the left airplane

386
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,890 
but unfortunately never gets there and
in fact

387
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,000 
its when k2 eventually becomes infinite
that this poll

388
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,410 
just gets to the point where the system
becomes

389
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,420 
marginally stable so

390
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,880 
what we found is dead with proportional
feedback

391
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,710 
we can stabilize the system with the
Riveter feedback

392
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,940 
we can stabilize the system by
themselves

393
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,830 
and a logical next choice is to see if
we can stabilize the system

394
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,770 
by both measuring the angle and at the
same time

395
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,280 
being careful to be responsive to how
fast that angle is changing so that if

396
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,049 
changing too fast

397
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,210 
we can move the cart are here are or are
hand under the inverted pendulum were

398
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,950 
quickly

399
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,950 
well now then what we want to examine

400
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,299 
is the use love proportional plus the
Riveter feedback

401
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,590 
and in that case we

402
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,980 
then have a

403
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,309 
choice for the acceleration which

404
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,630 
is proportional with one constant to the
angle

405
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,150 
and proportional with another constant
to

406
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,200 
the derivative up the angle and so

407
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,760 
the basic system function then

408
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,809 
with for for proportional plus the river
to feedback

409
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:12,330 
is a system function which is K one-plus
K two times s

410
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,250 
we then have an overall closed-loop
system function

411
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,740 
say to the vastus which is given by

412
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,770 
this equation and

413
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,070 
so the roots at this equation then

414
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,460 
represent the polls love the closed-loop
system

415
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,630 
and those polls involved

416
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,150 
to parameters they involve the primer k2

417
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,500 
which is proportional to the derivative
the angle

418
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,260 
and the constant k1 which is
proportional to the angle

419
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,540 
and will

420
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,660 
first have all examine this with just
with

421
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,120 
k to positive because well we can see is
that as we very k1

422
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,679 
k2 or negative that would more less
immediately

423
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,000 
put polls into the right half plane and
the more

424
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,770 
negative K two got the larger this term

425
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,990 
is going to get so in fact is it will
turn out we can stabilize the system

426
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,100 
with provided that we to choose k2

427
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,160 
to be greater than 0

428
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,720 
all right now with k2 greater than 0

429
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,360 
what happens in the

430
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,480 
location at the polls is that

431
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,799 
if k2 is greater than 0

432
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,870 
every choose k1 greater than 0 I'm sorry
choose k1 equal to 0

433
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,530 
then in effect the influence of k2

434
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,590 
is to shift the polls

435
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,950 
of the open-loop system slightly and so

436
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,770 
with k2 greater than 0

437
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,780 
and k1 equal to 0 we have a set of polls

438
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,809 
which are indicated here

439
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:08,299 
and so this is just a shift slight shift
to the left

440
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,309 
depending on the values k2 shift to the
left

441
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,880 
the open loop holes now as we very k1

442
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,919 
and in particular we're going to choose
k1

443
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,910 
greater than 0 what happens is that

444
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,890 
the polls will begin to move together

445
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,110 
as they did previously when we had

446
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,150 
one we looked at the variation k1

447
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,179 
the polls will move together reach a
point where we have a second-order poll

448
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:44,270 
and then those polls will split and move
parallel to the Chi Omega axis so

449
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,290 
with syndicated here is the root locus

450
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,220 
and what this represents then

451
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,760 
as long as we make a one large enough so
that

452
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,080 
this pole moves into the left airplane
is

453
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,040 
that represents now stable system

454
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,630 
okay so what we've seen is that
proportional feedback

455
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,350 
by itself or derivative feedback by
itself

456
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,200 
won't stabilize the system whereas with
the right choice

457
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,260 
a feedback Constance proportional plus
the rivet if the back well and we saw

458
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,820 
that

459
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,090 
basically by examining the root locus in
the ass play

460
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,410 
alright well let's actually watch the
system

461
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,880 
in action and I described it to you

462
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,750 
previously basically an inverted
pendulum on a card

463
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,540 
and so I still have it off and of course
we have the pendulum

464
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,630 
and as i indicated its

465
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,340 
pivoted at the base and the

466
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,500 
angle is measured by a potentiometer

467
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,900 
that we have attached to the pivot point
and

468
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,660 
the measurement of the angle is fed back

469
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,940 
through this wire to motor day

470
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,000 
we have at the other end of the table
and

471
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,380 
then that motor basically is used to
provide the acceleration

472
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,650 
to drive the cart okay well

473
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,760 
let's turn it on and when we turn it on
it'll take

474
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,880 
just an instant to stabilize

475
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,990 
and

476
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,540 
fortunately we have the cast set right
and there we have now

477
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,700 
the stabilization up an unstable system

478
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,860 
remember there with the feedback of the
system is unstable because the pendulum

479
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,929 
will fall

480
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,040 
whereas now it's stabilized now also

481
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,549 
as you can see not only have we

482
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:44,820 
stabilized it but we're able to
compensate for the feedback

483
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,919 
to changes in the external disturbances
for example by tapping it

484
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,590 
because it the feedback and the
measurement of the angle it will

485
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,780 
more or less automatically stabilize

486
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,190 
now in addition to being stable in the
presence of external disturbances

487
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,710 
it also remain stable in remains
balanced

488
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,840 
even if we were to change the system
dynamics

489
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,070 
and let me just illustrate that with

490
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,400 
the class that we talked about before
let's first

491
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,429 
not be too bold and will take the liquid
out of the class

492
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:23,559 
and presumably if it can adjust

493
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,890 
to changes in the system dynamics that
if I put the glass on

494
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,230 
in fact it will remain balanced and
indeed it does

495
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,540 
and let me point out by the way that I
don't have to be very careful about

496
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,750 
exactly where

497
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,809 
I position the class and furthermore I
can change the

498
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,150 
overall system even further

499
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,230 
by let's say for example pouring a
liquid and

500
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,500 
and now let me also comment that

501
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,850 
change the physics of a little bit
because the

502
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,150 
the liquid can slash around a little bit
it comes a little more complicated

503
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,549 
system

504
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:03,630 
but as you can see it still remains
balance

505
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,770 
now if we really don't want to be too
conservative that all we can wonder

506
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,490 
whether

507
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,030 
with the feedback Constance we have we
could

508
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,590 
in fact balance the picture on the top
and

509
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,000 
well I guess we may as well give that a
try

510
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,179 
and so

511
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:28,049 
now we're changing the mass at the top
to the the pendulum

512
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:31,210 
by a considerable amount

513
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,890 
and again the system basically can
respond to it

514
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,090 
now this is a fairly complicated system

515
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:44,210 
the liquid sloshing around we in fact as
you can see have instability right now

516
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,070 
although its control and that's because
the physics at the dynamics is changed

517
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,950 
and we can put a little bit more mass
into the system

518
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,950 
and maybe or maybe not that will cut
down on the instability

519
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,450 
okay well in fact what happened there is
that we

520
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,850 
increase the mass at the top the
pendulum slightly

521
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,000 
and that provided just enough damn thing
to do

522
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,470 
stabilize the system

523
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,480 
okay well with

524
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,890 
this lecture and this demonstration this

525
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,000 
concludes this entire set of lectures it
concludes especially if the pitcher

526
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,330 
happens to fall

527
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,400 
but seriously this concludes the

528
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,179 
said lectures as we have put them
together

529
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,410 
and let me just comment that

530
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,340 
as a professor of mine once said in
which I've never forgotten

531
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,650 
the purpose all over said have lectures
or a course or for that matter anything

532
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,820 
which is study

533
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,260 
is not really to cover a subject

534
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,330 
but to uncover the subject and I hope
dead

535
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,720 
at least in to some degree

536
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,240 
we were able to uncovered the topic of
signals and systems through the series

537
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,250 
of lectures

538
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,679 
there are a lot of topics that we

539
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,010 
got only a very brief glimpse into

540
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,169 
and I hope that at least four we've been
able to do

541
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,399 
is get you interested nothin I'm so that

542
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,970 
you pursue some of these on your own and

543
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,200 
so I'd like to conclude by thanks to you
both for your patience and your interest

544
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,539 
and I hope that you have enough interest
to

545
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,740 
pursue some these topics for them thank
you
