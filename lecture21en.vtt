the new the

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
last time we introduce the La Paz transform

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
as a generalization the Fourier transform and just as a reminder

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the lacrosse transform expression as we developed it

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is this integral very much

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
similar to the Fourier transform integral

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
except with more general complex variable and in fact we

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
developed and talked about the relationship between the apostrophe is

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
forming a 48 transform

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
in particular the apostrophe s form

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
where the Posterous for variable ass

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
purely imaginary in fact reduces

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to the 48 transform or

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
more generally with the process for variable as a complex number

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the a-plus transform is

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the Fourier transform love the corresponding time

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
function with an exponential weighting and

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
also as you should recall the

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
exponential weighting introduce the notion that

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the repost transform may converge for some bad use

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sigma and perhaps not for other values Sigma

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so associated with the look lost transform

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
was what we refer to as the region of convergence

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
now just says

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
with the Fourier transform there are a number of properties

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the applause transform that are extremely useful

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in describing and analyzing signals and systems

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
for example one other properties

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that we in fact took advantage out in our discussion last time

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
was the limit linearity property which says

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in essence that they'll a-plus transform love the linear combination

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
up to time functions is the same

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
linear combination love the associated with boss transforms

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
also there is a very important and useful property which tells us

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
how the derivative overtime function

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or rather the applause transformer the derivative

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is related to the low-priced transform in particular

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the a-plus transformer the derivative is the apostrophe is for affective T

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
multiplied by ass and as you can see by just sending a sequel to jail maker

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
in fact this reduces to the corresponding Fourier transform property

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a third property that in fact will make frequent you so

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is referred to as the convolution property

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
again a generalization of the convolution property for 48 transforms

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
here the convolution property says that

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the applause transform the convolution a two-time functions

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
is the product love The Associated

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the floss transforms now

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
its important at some point

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to think carefully about the region of convergence

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
as we discuss these properties and let me just

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
draw your attention to the fact dead in

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
discussing properties fully and in detail

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
one has to pay attention not just to

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
how the algebraic expression changes

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but also what the consequences are for the region of convergence

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and thats discuss in somewhat more detail in the text and I won't do that

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
here

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
now the convolution property

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
leads to of course a very important and useful

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
mechanism for dealing with linear time-invariant systems

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
very much as the 48 transformed did in particular

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the convolution property tells us that

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
if we have a linear time-invariant system

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the output in the time domain of course is the convolution

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
of the input and the impulse response

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in the applause transform domain the a-plus transformer the output

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is the love plus transformer the impulse response

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
times the low-priced transformer the input

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and again this of course is a generalization

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
love the corresponding property for 48 transports

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in the case I'll the 48 transform

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the Fourier transform the appalls response we refer to as the frequency

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
response

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in the more general case with applause transforms

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's typical to refer to the apostrophe its former the impulse response

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
as the system function

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
now the

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in talking about the system function

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
the issue some issues love the region of convergence and for that matter location

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
opposes the system function

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
are closely tied in and related

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to issues of whether the system is stable and causal

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and in fact there's some useful statements that can be made

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that play an important role throughout the further discussion

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
for example we know from previous discussions

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that the there's a condition for stability of a system which is absolute

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
integrability of the impulse response

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and that in fact is the same condition

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
for convergence of the Fourier transform of the impulse response

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
what that says really is that

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
if a system is stable then the region of convergence

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of the system function must include the che Omega axis which of course is where

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the applause transform reduces to the Fourier transform

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so that relates the regional convergence and stability

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
also you recall from last time

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that we talked about the regional convergence associated with

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
right-sided time functions in particular for right-sided time function the reach

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
of convergence

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
must be to the right the rightmost poll

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
well if in fact we have a system that's causal

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
then the that causality

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
imposes the condition that the impulse response be right sided

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
its own fact for causality we would have a regional convergence

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
associated with the system function which is to the right to the right most

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
poll

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
now interestingly in very important is

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the consequence if you put those two statements together

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
in particular your lead to the conclusion

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that for stable causal system

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
all the polls must be in the left half

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
up the ass play what's the reason

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the reason of course is that if the system is stable in causal

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the regional convergence must be to the right of the rightmost poll

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it must include DJ Omega axes obviously then

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
all the polls must be in the left after the S

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and again that's an issue that is discussed

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
somewhat more carefully and in more detail in the text

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
now the properties that we're talking about here

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
are not the only properties there are many others

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but these properties in particular provide

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the mechanism as they did with Fourier transforms

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
for turning linear constant coefficient differential equations into algebraic

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
equations

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and correspondingly lead to a mechanism

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
for dealing with solving when your constant coefficient differential

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
equations

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and I'd like to illustrate that by looking

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
at both first-order and second-order differential equations

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
let's begin first evolve with the first-order

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
differential equation and in so what we're talking about

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is a first order system

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
what I mean by that is a system that's

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
characterize by a first-order differential equation

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and if we apply to this equation the

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
differentiation property then

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the derivative the prosperous for the derivative

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is s times the apostrophe s former the time function

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the linearity property allows us to combine these two gether

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and so consequently applying the law applies transformed to this equation

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
leads us to this algebraic equation and following that through

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
leads us to the statement that the a-plus trance for the output

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is one over est plus a times the applause transformer the input

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
we know from the convolution property that in fact this full price transform

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
is the system function

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
times X evas and so one over est plus a a

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is the system function or equivalently the applause transform of the impulse

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
response

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
so we can determine the impulse response

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
by taking the inverse Laplace transform

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
all HFS given by one over est plus a

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
well we can do that using the inspection method which is one way that we have

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
doing inverse Laplace transforms the question is then what time

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
function has a plus transform which is one over est plus a

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the problem that we run into in fact is that there are two answers to that

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
one over est plus 80 is the applause transform

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are an exponential for positive time

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but one over est plus a is also the apostrophe s for

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Aug an exponential for negative time

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
which one of these do we end up picking

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
well recall that the difference between the

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is was in their region of convergence and in fact

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
in this case this corresponded to a region of convergence

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
which was the real part a vast greater than minus a

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
in this case this was the corresponding applause transform

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
provided at the real party bass is

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
less than mine is a so we have to decide

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
which region of convergence that we pick

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and it's not the differential equation that will tell us that

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
its something else that has to give us that information

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what could it be well what it might be is the additional

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
information that the system is either stable or causal

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so for example if the system was causal we would know that the regional

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
convergence is to the right of the poll

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and that would correspond and to this

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
being the impulse response

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
whereas with a negative

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry with a positive if we knew

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that the system let's say was not causal

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
then we would associate with that this region convergence

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and we know that we would know then that this is the impulse response

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
so a very important point is that

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
what we see is that the when your car is the coefficient differential equation

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
gives us the algebraic

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
expression for the system function

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but does not tell us about the region of convergence we get the region of

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
convergence

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
from some auxiliary information what is that information

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
well it might for example the knowledge that

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the system is perhaps table

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
which tells us that the regional convergence includes the jail making

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
axis

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
or perhaps causal which tells us that the region of convergence

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is to the right to the right most poll so it's the auxiliary information

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
specifies 4s the region of convergence

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
very important point the differential equation by itself is not completely

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
specify

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the system it only essentially tells us what the algebraic expression is for the

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
system function

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
alright that's a first order example let's now look at

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
a second-order system and the differential equation that I picked

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in this case I've parameterized in a certain way which will see will be

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
useful

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
in particular it's the second order differential equation and I've chosen

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
just for simplicity to not include

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
a derivatives on the right hand side although we could have

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
in fact if we did that would insert zeros into the system function

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
as well as the polls inserted by the left hand side

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
we can determine the system function in exactly the same way namely apply the

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
applause transformed to this equation

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that would convert this differential equation to

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
an algebraic equation and now on we solve

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
this algebraic equation for why a bass

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
in terms of x a badass it will come out in the former why evas

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
equal to H a vast times X a badass

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and H invest in that case we would get simply by dividing out by this

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
polynomial an ass and so the system function and

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
is the expression that I have here

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
so this is the form for second-order system

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
where there are two pole since this is the second order polynomial

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
there are no zeros Associated

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
in with the fact that I had no derivative up the input on the right

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
hand side of the equation

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
well let's look at this example

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
namely the second-order system a little more detail

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and what we want to look at is the location at the polls and some issues

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
such as for example the frequency response

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
so here again I have the algebraic

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
expression for the system function

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
in and as i indicated this is the second order polynomial

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
which means that we can factor it into two routes

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and so c1 and c2 represent the polls have the system function

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and in particular in relation to the two parameters

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
say to and Omega Sapan if we look at

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
what these routes are than what we get

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
are the to expressions that I have below

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and notice incidently dead if data is

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
less than 1 than what's under the square root

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is negative and so this in fact corresponds to an imaginary

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
part an imaginary term for Zeta less than 1

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and so the two routes then have

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
a real part which is given by -8 Omega Sapan

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and an imaginary part if I were to rewrite this

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and then expressed in terms or Jr skirted -1

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
in looking below will have a real part

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
which is -8 Omega Sapan an imaginary part which is omega Sapan

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
times this square root thats reseda

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
less than 1 and for Zeta greater than one

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the two routes of course will be real

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
part so let's examine this for the case where

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
data is less than 1 and

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
what that corresponds to then are to polls in the complex

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
plane and they have

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
a real part and an imaginary part

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and you can exploit this is somewhat more detail on your own

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
but essentially what happens is that as you keep the parameter

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Omega stuff and fixed and very

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
data these polls trace out

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
a circle and for example

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
with say to equal to 0 the polls

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
are on the jail may access at Omega Sapan

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
for as as say to

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
because once as a day

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
increases and gets closer to one

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
these the polls converge toward the real axis

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and any particular for

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
say to greater than one what we end up with

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
are to polls on the real axis

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
well actually the case that we want to look at

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
a little more carefully is when the polls are complex

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and what this becomes is a second-order system which has we'll see

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
as the discussion goes on as an impulse response which

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
oscillates with time correspondingly a frequency response

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that has a residence well let's examine

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the frequency response little more carefully

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and 1 I'm assuming in the discussion is that first of all

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the polls are in the left half plane corresponding

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to they don't make this a ban being positive

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and so this is minus that is negative and furthermore I'm assuming that the

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
polls are complex

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and in that case the algebraic expression

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
for the system function is omega cement squared in the numerator and two poles

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
in the denominator which a complex conjugates

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
now what we want to look at is

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
the frequency response the system

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and that corresponds to looking at

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the 4e a transformer the impulse response

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
which is the a-plus transform on the jail making access

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
so we want to examine what HSC is as we move

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
along the jail make axes and notice that to do that

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
in this algebraic expression

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
we want to set s equal to jail maker and then

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
evaluate for example we want to look at the magnet to the frequency response

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
evaluate the magnet to of the complex number

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
well there's a very convenient way of doing that geometrically

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
by recognizing dead in the complex plane

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
this complex number minus back complex number represents a vector

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and essentially to look at the magnitude of this complex number

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
corresponds to taking omega Steuben squared and dividing it

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
by the product all the links of these factors

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
so let's look for example at the vector ass minus C-one

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
where s is on the Chi Omega axis

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and doing that here is

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the vector C-one

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and here is the vector ass which is jail make if we're looking let's say at this

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
bad you frequency

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and this specter than is the vector

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
which he is J Omega minus C-one

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
so in fact it's the link that this vector

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that we want to observed as we change

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Omega namely as we move along the Chi Omega axis

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you want to take this specter and this specter

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
take the lights at those factors multiply them together

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
divide that it will make its offense where'd and that will give us

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the frequency response that's little heart

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
to see at a frequency response will work out just looking at one point although

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
notice that as we move along the jail make axes

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
as we get closer to this poll this vector in fact gets shorter

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
at so we might expect that

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the frequency response as a moving along the Chi Omega axis in the vicinity is

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that poll

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
would start to pee well I think that all of this

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is much better seen dynamically on the computer display

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
so let's go to the computer display and what we look at

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is a second-order system the frequency response a bit as we move

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
along jail make acts

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
so here we see the poll pair in the complex plane

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and to generate the frequency response

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
we want to look at the behavior of the poll vectors as we move vertically

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
along the chair make axis so we'll

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
show the poll vectors and let's begin

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
at Omega equal 0 so here we have the poll vectors from the polls to the point

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Omega equal to 0 and as we move vertically along the jail make axis will

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
see how the those poll vectors

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
change in length the magnitude of the frequency response is the reciprocal

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the product are the lights are those factors

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
shown below is the frequency response

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
where we've begun just that'll make equal to 0

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and as we move vertically

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
along the jail make axis and the poll vector last change

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that will then influence what the frequency response looks like we've

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
started here too move a little bit

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
away from Omega equal to 0 and

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
notice that in the upper half plane the poll vector has gotten shorter

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the poll vector for the pole in the lower half plane has gotten longer

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and now as omega increases further

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that process will continue and in particular

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the poll vector associated with the poll in the upper half plane

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
will be as short as in the vicinity

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
are in a freak at a frequency in the vicinity of that poll

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and so for that frequency than the frequency response will P

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and we see that here

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
from this point as the frequency increases

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
corresponding to moving further vertically along the chair maker axes

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
both poll vectors will increase in laying

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and that means then dead the magnet to

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the frequency response will decrease for this specific example

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the magnitude of the frequency response will

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
asymptotically go to zero

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
so what we see here is there the frequency response has a resonance

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and as we see geometrically from the way

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
defectors behave their residence in frequency

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
is very clearly associated with the position at the polls

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and so in fact illustrate that further and

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
dramatize it as long as we're focused on it let's now

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
look at the frequency response for the second order example

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
as we change the pole positions and first what we'll do

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
is let the polls move vertically

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
parallel to the Chi Omega axes and see how the frequency

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
response changes and then we'll have the polls move

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
horizontally parallel to the relaxes and see how the frequency response changes

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
to display the behavior the frequency response is the polls move we've

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
change the vertical scale on

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the frequency response somewhat and

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
now what we want to do is move the polls

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
first parallel to the jail make axis and then

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
parallel to the real axis here we see the

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
effect moving the polls parallel to the jail may axis

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and what we observe is that in fact the frequency

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
location the residence shifts basically tracking

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the location at the pole

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
if we now move the poll back

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
down closer to the real axis then

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
this residents will shift back toward its original location

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and so let's now see that

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and here we are back at the frequency that we started at

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
now will move the polls even closer to the real axis

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the frequency location at the residence

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
will continue to shift toward lower frequencies

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and also in the process incidently

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the height ove the resonant peak will increase

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
because of course the lengths love

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the poll factors are getting shorter

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and so we see now the residence shifting down toward lower and lower frequency

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and finally what

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
will now do is move the polls back to their

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
original position and the resonant peak will

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
of course shift back up and correspondingly

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the height or amplitude the residence

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
will decrease and now we're back at the frequency response that

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we head generated previously next we'd like to look at the behavior as the

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
polls

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
move parallel to the real axis first closer to the J Omega axis and then

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
further away

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
as they move closer to the jail make access

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the residence sharpens because of the fact

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that the poll factor get shorter and responds

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
or changes in like more quickly as we move past it

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
moving along the jail make axis so

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
here we see the effect a move in the polls closer to the jail make axis

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the residence has gotten narrower in frequency

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and higher in amplitude associated with the fact that the poll vector get

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
shorter

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
next

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
as we move back to the original location

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the residents will broaden once again and the airport to

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
will decrease

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and then if we continue to move the polls even further away

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
from the real axis the residents will broaden

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
even further and the ample to the peak will

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
become even smaller and finally

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
let's now just move the polls back to

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
their original position and we'll see

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the Reds residence narrow again and become higher

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and so what we see then is that for

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
a second-order system the behavior above the residents basically is associated

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
with the Polo cations the frequency the residence associated with the vertical

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
position in the polls

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and the sharpness at the residence

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Associated with the real party polls in other words there

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
position closer or further away from the

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
J Omega axis okay so

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
for complex polls then into the second order

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
system what we see is that we get

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
a resident kind of behavior and

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in particular then that resident behavior

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
tens to peak or get pic year

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
as the value of data gets smaller

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and here just to remind you what you saw

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
here is the frequency response with

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
one particular choices values well this is normalized to make a span is one one

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
particular choice for Zeta

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
family .4 here is

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
what we have with say to smaller

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and finally here is example

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
where say that has gotten even smaller than that and what that corresponds to

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
is the polls moving closer to the jail make axes

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the corresponding frequency response getting PQ

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
now in the

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
time-domain what happens is that

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we have of course these complex roots

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
which I indicated previously where

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
this represents the imaginary part because data is less than one

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and in the time domain we will have

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
a form for the behavior which is a

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
e2 the C-one TV plus a conjugate

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
eat so the C-one conjugate

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
see and so

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
in fact as the polls get closer to the jail make axis cars fine to use a to

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
getting smaller

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
as the polls get closer to

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the chair maker axis in the frequency domain

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the residences get sharper in the time domain

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the real part all the polls has gotten smaller

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and that means in fact that in the time domain

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
behavior will be more oscillatory and less than

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and so just looking at that again

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
here is in the time domain

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
what happens first IPL with

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and the parameter say to equal to

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
.4 and isolates an exponentially

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
dies out year

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
is the second-order system

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
where data is now point to is that a point for

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and finally the second-order system

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
wears a to is .1

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and what we see as say to get smaller and smaller

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
is dead the oscillations are basically the same but

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the exponential damping becomes

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
less and less right now

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
this is a somewhat more detailed look at second-order systems

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and second or two systems and for that matter first order systems are

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
systems that are important in their own right but

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
they also are important as basic building blocks

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
for more general in particular for higher-order systems

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and the way in which that stone typically

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
is by combining first- and second-order systems together

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
in such a way that they implement higher-order systems

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and two very common connections are

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
connections which are cascade connections

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and connections which are parallel connections in a cascade connection

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
we would think love combining this system

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
systems individual systems together as i indicated herein series

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and of course from the convolution property the overall system function

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
is the product of the individual system functions

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so for example if these were all

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
second-order systems and I A combined and have them together in cascade

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
the overall system would be a system that would have

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
2n polls in other words it would be a 2n order system

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
that's one very common kind of connection another

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
very common kind of connection for first- and second-order systems

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
is a parallel connection where in that case

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we connect the systems together as they indicate here

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
the overall system function is just simply the sum of these and that follows

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
from the linearity property

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and so the overall system function would be as i indicate

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
algebraically here and notice that

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
if each of these are second-order systems

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and I had capital and have them in parallel

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
when you think a putting the overall system function over one common

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
denominator

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that common denominator in general is going to be

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
all order to an so either

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the parallel connection or the Cascade connection

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
can be used to implement higher-order systems

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
one very common context in which second-order systems

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
are combined together either in parallel

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
or in cascade to form a

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
more interesting system is in fact

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
in speech synthesis and what I'd like to do is

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
demonstrate a speech synthesizer which I have here

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
which in fact is a parallel

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
combination 04 second-order

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
systems very much are the type that we've just talked about

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
all returned to the synthesizer in a minute let me

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
first just indicate with the basic idea is in speech synthesis

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
of course what we're trying to represent a reply man is something dead

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
corresponds to the vocal tract

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
the vocal tract is characterized by said residences

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and we can think of representing you to those residences by a second-order

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
system

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and then the higher-order system corresponding to the vocal tract

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
is built by in this case a parallel combination

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
the second-order systems and so

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
for the synthesizer what we have connected together

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
in parallel is 4

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
second-order systems and

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
a control on each one of them that controls the center frequency

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
or the resonant frequency love each oath

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
the second-order systems

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the exhortation is an exhortation

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that would represent the airflow through the vocal cords

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
the vocal cords vibrate and their pop severe

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
through the vocal cords as they open and close it so the exhortation

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
for the synthesizer corresponds to

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
a pulse train representing

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
the airflow through the vocal cords the fundamental frequency if this

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
representing the fundamental frequency love

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the synthesized voice so that's the basic

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
structure the synthesizer and what we have in this

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
analog synthesizer are separate controls

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
on the individual center frequencies

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
their is a control representing the center frequency of the third resonator

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and the fourth resonator and those are represented by these two knobs

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and then the first and second resonators

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
are controlled by moving this joystick the first resonator

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
by moving the joystick along this axis

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and the second resonator by moving the joystick along this axis

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and then in addition to controls on

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the for resonators we can control

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the fundamental frequency the exhortation and we do that

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
with this not so let's first of all just listen

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
to wanted the resonators and the resonator that

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'll play is the fourth resonator and

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
what you'll hear first is the output as a very

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the center frequency of that resonator stonewalling

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
share

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and then free she's acts

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and then as I A indicated I can also control the fundamental frequency the

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
exhortation

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
by turning this knob Ste

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
slowing the fundamentals she K

00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
he

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
all right now if the four resonators in parallel

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
are and implementation love the vocal cavity

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
then presumably we can synthesize when we put them all in

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
are Val sounds and let's do that

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
on now switch in the other resonators

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
when we do that then

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
depending on

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
what choice we have to the individual resonant frequencies

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
we should be able to synthesize balanced sound so here for example is the Val

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
E Ste here's

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
of

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
act and

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
course we can

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
generate

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
lots of other Val sounds

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and change the fundamental frequency same time

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
now if we want to synthesize speech

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
it's not enough to just synthesized steady-state Balzac its

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
boring after a while course what happens with

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the vocal cavity is that it moves as a function of time

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and that's what generates the the

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
speech that we want to generate and so

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
presumably man if we change these

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
resonant frequencies as a function of time appropriately

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
then we should be able to synthesize speech and so by

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
moving these residences around weekend generate

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
synthesized speech and can let's try it

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
a with some phrases and I'll do that

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
by simply adjusting the center frequencies appropriately

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
now

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
well hopefully you

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
understood that is you can imagine I spend at least a few minutes before

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the lecture try to practice that's so that it would come out

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
to be more less intelligible now

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the system as i've just demonstrated is

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
of course a continuous-time system or an analyte speech synthesizer

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
their are many versions of

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
digital or discrete-time synthesizers one of the first in fact

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
being a device that many view

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
are very likely familiar with which is the Texas Instruments speak n spell

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
which

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I show here and what's

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
very interesting and rather dramatic about this device

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
is the fact that it implements the speech synthesis in very much the same

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
way as

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I've demonstrated with the analog synthesizer

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
in this case it's five second-order filters

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
in a configuration that slightly different than a parallel configuration

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but conceptually

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
very closely related and let's take a look

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
inside the box and what we see their

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
with a slide that was kindly supplied by Texas Instruments

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
is the fact that there really are only four chips in the air

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
a controller chips and storage and the important point is the chip that's

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,000
labeled

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
as the speech synthesis chip in fact

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
is what embodies our implements the five

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
second order filters and in addition

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
incorporate some other things a memory and also the

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
D-day converters so in fact the

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
implementation and the synthesizer is pretty much done on a single chip

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
well that's a discrete-time

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
system we've been talking for the last

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
several lectures about continuous-time systems and no fuss transform

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
hopefully what you've seen in this lecture in the previous lecture

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
is the powerful tool

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
dead the a poss transform affords us

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
in analyzing and understanding

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
system behavior in the next lecture

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
what I'd like to do is parallel the discussion

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
for discrete-time turn our attention to busy transform

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and as you can imagine simply by virtue of the fact that

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
we I've kinda shown you a digital and analog

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
version a very much the same kind of system the discussions

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
how all themselves very strongly and dizzy transform

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
will play very much the same role in discrete-time that

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the apostrophe is formed dozen continues thank you
