the new

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
are

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
over the last several lectures we've dealt with the representation

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of linear time-invariant systems through convolution

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and just to remind you over basic strategy

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
essentially the idea was to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
exploit the notion of when the arity by

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
decomposing the input into summer basic inputs

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and then using when the arity to tell us that the output can be represented as

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the corresponding linear combination of the Associated outputs

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so if we have a linear system

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
either continuous-time and discrete-time for example with continuous time

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
if the input is decomposed as a linear combination

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
a basic inputs with each of these basic inputs

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
generating an Associated output and if the system is linear

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
then the output love the system

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is the same linear combination love The Associated outputs

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and the same statement is identical

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
both for continuous-time in discrete-time so

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the strategy is to decompose the input into these basic inputs

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and the imports

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
were chosen also with some particular

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
strategy in mind in particular for both continuous-time

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
for discrete-time in this representation the

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
basic inputs used in the decomposition

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are chosen first the ball so that

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
a broad class signals can be represented

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
interns are these basic inputs and second of all

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
so that the response to these basic inputs

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is in some sense easy to compute now

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in the representation which latest

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to convolution the particular choice that we made

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
in the discrete-time case for our basic inputs

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
was a decomposition up the input interns

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
or delayed impulses and

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The Associated outputs that that generated

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
were delayed versions of the impulse response

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
decomposing the input into a linear combination of these

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the output into the corresponding linear combination of these

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
then led to the convolution some in

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the discrete-time case and

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
in the continuous-time case a similar

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
kinda decomposition in terms of impulses and Associated representation

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
love the output in terms of the impulse response

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
led to the convolution in ago now

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in this lecture and for number the succeeding lectures

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
will want to turn our attention to a very different

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
said the basic building blocks and

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in particular the signals there

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
will be using as the building blocks for or more general signals

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
rather than impulses as we've dealt with before

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
will be in general complex exponentials

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
so in a general sense

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in the continuous-time case and will be thinking in terms of a decomposition

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
afar signals as a linear combination I'll

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
complex exponentials continuous-time

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or in the discrete-time case

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
complex exponentials where sees the case complex here

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in discrete-time and s2 K's complex here

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in continuous-time now

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the basic strategy of course requires

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
dead we choose a settlement puts basic building blocks

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
which have two properties one is that

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the system response be straightforward to compute were in some sense easy to

00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
compute

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and the second is that it be a fairly general said a building blocks

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so that we can build lots of signals I love them

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
what will find with complex exponentials either continuous-time and discrete-time

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is that they very nicely have those two properties

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
in particular the notion that the

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
output over linear time-invariant system is easy to compute

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is tied to what's referred to as the eye can function property

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
a complex exponentials which will focus on

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
shortly in a little more detail

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and second of all the fact that

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
weekend in fact represent very broad classes have signals as linear

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
combinations

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
these will be a topic an issue

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that will develop in detail over in fact are the next

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
set of lectures this lecture and the next set of lectures

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
now in in doing this although

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we could in fact begin with our attention focused

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
on in general complex exponentials

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
what will choose to do his first focus on the case in which

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the exponent in the continuous-time cases

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
purely imaginary as i indicate here

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and in the discrete-time case where

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the magnitude of the complex number Z CK

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is equal to 1 so what that corresponds to in the continuous-time case

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is said building blocks

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the form you DJ Omega sed Katie

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and in the discrete-time case said a building blocks

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the for eat a DJ Omega KN

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
well we'll see is a representation in these Terms

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
leads to what's for two as for EA

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
analysis and that's what we'll be dealing with over the next several

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
lectures

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
will then be exploiting this representation actually

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
through most the course and then toward

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
the end of the course will returned to generalizing

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the for a representation to the discussion over plus transforms the

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
transforms

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so for now we want to restrict ourselves to

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
complex exponentials a particular form in

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and in fact also initially to continuous-time

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
signals and systems so let's begin

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
with the continuous-time case the complex exponentials that we want to

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
deal with

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
in and focus first the ball on what I refer to as

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the eigenfunction property love this particular set a building blocks

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we're talking about

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
basic signals the form either the J Omega some Katy

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and this statement is there

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
for a linear time-invariant system the response to one of these

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is 0 exactly the same form

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
just simply multiplied by a complex

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
factor that complex factor depending on

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
what the frequency Omega k is

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
now more or less the justification for this is the proof follows by

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
simply looking at the response to a complex exponential

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
using the convolution integral so

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if we put a complex exponential

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
into a linear time-invariant system

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
with impulse response a gypsy then

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we can express the response as i've indicated here

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we can then recognize that this complex exponential

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
can be factored into two terms and so

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we can rewrite this complex exponential

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
as this product second recognize

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that this term can be taken

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
outside the integral over here because of the fact that

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
it depends only on tea and not on tap now

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and so what we're left with when we tracked this through

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
is that with a complex exponential input we get

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
an output which is the same complex exponential

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
namely this factor times

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
this integral and this integral is

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
what I referred to above as

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
H all omega-6 K

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and so in fact we put in a complex exponential

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
we get out a complex exponential love the same frequency

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
multiplied by a complex constant and

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that is what's referred to as the eigenfunction property I can function

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
meaning

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
that and I can function of a system or mathematical expression

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
is a function which when you put it through the system

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
comes out looking exactly the same except for a change in amplitude

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that change in amplitude being the eigen value so

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
in fact this function is

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the eigenfunction

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and this bad you

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is the I can bag

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
okay now it's because if the eigenfunction

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
property that complex exponentials a particularly convenient as building

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
blocks

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
namely you put it through the system they come out with the same form

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and simply scale the other part to the question related

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to the strategy that we've been pursuing is

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to hope that the signals

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
can be used as building blocks to represent a

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
very broad classes signals through linear combination

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and in fact that turns out to be the case with complex exponentials

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
as we worked our way through that

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
will first consider the case love periodic signals

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and what that leads to is a representation a periodic signals

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
through what's called the forty a series following that

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we will turn our attention to non periodic or as I refer to it a periodic

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
signals

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and the representation that's developed

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
interns love linear combinations a complex exponentials

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
is what's referred to as the 48 transport so

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the first thing that we want to deal with our periodic signals

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and before you series okay so

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
what we're talking about then is the continuous-time

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
for a series and

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the for a series is a representation for

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
periodic continuous-time signals we have

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
a signal then which is periodic and

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
were choosing t0 to denote the period

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
so its t0

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
then corresponds to the period

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
our periodic signal Omega 0

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is to party over t0 as

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you recall from our discussion love

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
periodic signals and sinusoids before and that's two pirates 0

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
so this is the fundamental frequency now

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
let's examine first the ball complex exponentials

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and recognize first the ball that

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
there is a complex exponential that has

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
exactly the same period and

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
fundamental frequency as are more general periodic signal

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
namely the complex exponential you to the jail maker 0t

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
where Omega 0 is to Paul II over t0

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
or equivalent Lee t0 is to pie over Omega 0 now

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that's the complex exponential which has

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
t0 as the fundamental period but

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
think there are harmonically related complex exponentials

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that also have t0 as a period

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
although in fact their fundamental period shorter

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so we can also look at complex exponentials

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
before either the JK Omega 0t

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
these likewise are periodic

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
with the period love t0

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
although in fact their fundamental period

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is t0 divided by K or equivalently

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to par i divided by their fundamental frequency

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
k Omega 0 so as K

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
a richer varies these correspond to

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
harmonically related complex exponentials

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
now with the forty a series

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
says and will justify this kinda bit by bit is the discussion goes I'm

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
what the four-day series says that in fact what for EA

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
said which was essentially the

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is brilliant insight is that if I have

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
a very general periodic signal I can represented as a linear combination of

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
these harmonically related

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
complex exponentials so

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that representation is what i've indicated here

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and this summation is

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
what will be referred to as

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
the for EA

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
series

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and as we proceed with the discussion there are two issues

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
couldn't that will develop one is assuming

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that our periodic signal can be represented this way

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
how do we determine the for a series coefficients

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
as they refer to a suitcase that's one question

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and the second question will be

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
how broad a class of signals in fact can be represented that

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
this way and bats another question their

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
will deal with separately

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
now just focusing on this representation

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for a minute this representation

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
love the four EA series which

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I repeated again

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
here

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
is what's referred to as the complex

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
exponential form love for EA series

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and it's important to note incidently

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
day this summation involves frequencies k Omega 0

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
their are both positive and negative

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in other words this index K runs over

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
limits that include both negative values and positive ads

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
now that complex exponential form is one

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
representation for before you a series

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and in fact it's the one that we will be principally

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
relying on in this course there is another representation that

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
perhaps you come across previously

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and that in a variety of other contacts is

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
is typically used which is called the trigonometric form

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the forty a series without really tracking through the algebra

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
essentially we can get to the trigonometric for

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
from the complex exponential form by

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
recognizing that if we express the complex coefficients

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
in polar for or in rectangular for

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and expand the complex exponential

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
term out in terms of cosine plus J sign

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
using just simply Oilers relation then

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
in we will end up with the representation

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for the periodic signal

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
were a re expression love the for a series

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
expression that we had previously either in the form that I indicate here

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
we're now the periodic signal is expressed

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in terms of a summation love cosines

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
with appropriate ample to in phase

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or another acquittal or triggered a metric for

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
involves rearranging this

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
in terms or a combination

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
of cosines and signs now

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
in this representation the frequencies of the sinusoids

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
very only over positive frequencies

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and typically one thinks

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
of periodic signals is having positive frequencies associated with them

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
however let's look back

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
at the complex exponential form

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
for the forty a series at the top of the board

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and in that representation when we use this representation

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
will find it convenient to refer to both

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
positive frequencies and negative frequencies so

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the representation that we will most typically be using is the complex

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
exponential form

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and in that form what will find as we think it decomposing a periodic signal

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
in to its compliments

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
at different frequencies it will involve both positive frequencies

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
negative frequencies

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
okay now we have the

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
for EA series representation as i've indicated here

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
again so far I sidestepped the issue as

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to whether this in fact represents all the signals that we'd like to represent

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
let's first address the issue

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
love how we determine these coefficients

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Acer K assuming that in fact this representation is Val

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and again all kinda move through the algebra

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
fairly quickly its a the outbreak steps the ones that

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
you can pursue more leisurely just the kinda

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
verify them in step through them but

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
essentially the algebra develops I did the recognition

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that if we integrate a complex exponential

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
over one period t0

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and I mean by this notation that this is an integral

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
over a period where I don't particularly care

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
where the period starts and where the period stops in other words

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
exactly what period I picked that this integral

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
is equal to t0 when M is equal to 0

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and it's equal to 0 if am is not equal to 0

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that follow simply from the fact that if we substitute in

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
for using Oilers relations so that we have the integral to cosign

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
was J times assign if M

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
is not equal to 0 than

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
of these integrals over a period are

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
0 the integral over sign it a periodic have a sinus or a cosigner sign

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
over an integral number periods is zero whereas

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
if M is equal to 0 this in a crawl

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
will be equal to 20 the integral the cosine

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and the integral on the sign is equal to

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
okay well the next step

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in developing the expression for the coefficients a Sat K

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
is to refer back to

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
before a series expression which was that except he

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is equal to the sum with basic K either the JK Omega 0t

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
if we multiply both sides that by either minus

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
jaan Omega 0t and

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
integrate that over a period

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
both sides of the equation integrated over a period

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
so these two equations are equal and then

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in essence interchange the summation and the integration

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
so that this pardon the expression cons outside the psalm

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and then we combine these two complex exponentials together

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
where we come out is

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the expression that i've indicated here in

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and then essentially what happens at this point algebraically

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
is that we use the result that we just developed

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to evaluate this cynical so

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
multiplying both sides the forty a series in and doing the integration

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
leads us after the appropriate manipulation

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
to the expression that

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I have up here and

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
this is equal to

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
this integral is equal to t0

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
if K is equal to an

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
corresponding 20 up here and 80

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
otherwise which is what we have demonstrated or are you previously

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and the upshot of all that then is that

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the right hand side if this expression disappears

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
except for the term when K is equal to n

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and so finally we have what I indicate here

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
taking t0 and moving it over to the other side of the equation

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
we then that then tells us

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
how we determine the forty a series coefficients

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
a7 Auris K so

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
that in effect and is the

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
excessive to me

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and tells us how to get the for a series coefficients

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
what are referred to as

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the 48 series synthesis equation

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
is the equation that tells us

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
how to build exit see outta love

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
these complex exponentials so we have the synthesis equation

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
which is the one that we started from we have

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the analysis equation which is the equation

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that we just developed

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
okay so we in effect have

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
going through the issue love assuming there for a series representation

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
is in fact valid how we get

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the coefficients we want to address

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
somewhat the question love how broad a classic signals that we're talking

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
are we talking about and what's in fact amazing

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and was for EA's amazing insight

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
was that it's a very broad class say but

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
let's first look at just some examples

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
in which we take a signal assume that it has the Fourier series representation

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and see what the for a series coefficients look like so

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
will begin with what I refer to as

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
an antisymmetric periodic square wave periodic of course because we're talking

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
about periodic signals

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
square wave referring to its shape and

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
antisymmetric referring to the fact that it is an odd

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
time function in other words it is antisymmetric

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
about the origin now

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
the expression for the for a series coefficients

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
tells us that we determine a sieve K

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
by taking one over 20 times the integral over a period

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
affects 50 either minus JK Omega 0t

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
DT the most convenient thing in this case

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is to choose a period which

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
let's say goes from minus 20 over to the plus 20 over to

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
so here except he is -1 here

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
expertise plus one and so

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I've expressed the for a series called efficiency as

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
this integral that's from minus 20 over

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and then and it said that is the

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
positive part of the cycle and so we have

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
these two integrals now I don't want to

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
tracked through the details both the algebra again I

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I guess I've decided that that's much more fun for you do on your own

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but the way it comes out when you go through it

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
is the expression that I finally indicate after

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
suggesting that there are a few more steps to follow

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and what develops is that

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
those two integrals together for K

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
not equal to 0 come out to this expression

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and that expression is not valid for k equal to 0

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
per kg equal to 0 we can go back to

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the basic expression for the forty a series

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
which is one over t0 the integral over a period

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
exit see in the minus JK Omega 0 /td TD

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
for cake 10 of course this term

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
just simply becomes one and

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
so the zeroth coefficient is one over 20 times the integral

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
X 50 over a period now

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
going back to the original function

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that we have what we're saying then is that

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
0th coefficient is one over 20 times the integral over

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
one period which is in effect the average value

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and it straight forward to verify the for this case that average value

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
is equal to 0 okay

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
now let's look at

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
these for a series coefficients on a bar graph

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and i've indicated that here the

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
expression for the for a series coefficients we just developed and

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
a involves its

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
0 for cake 0 it's a factor this form

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
for canine equal to 0 plotted on a bar graph

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
then we see values like this 0

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
at cake 0 and and associated values

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and their number things to focus on

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
when you look at this

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
one is the fact that the forty a series coefficients for this example

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
are surely imaginary

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
a second is that the Fourier series coefficients for this example

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
are odd sequence in other words if you look at this sequence which you see

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
are these values for negative K

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
flipped over so there their imaginary

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and odd and

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
what that results in when

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
you look at the

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
the triggered a metric form the 4e a series

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
is that in fact those conditions if you put the terms altogether

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
lead you to a trigger a metric representation

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
which involves only sign terms

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in other words no co-signed turns let me just draw your attention to the fact

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
since a suitcase the acer case or imaginary

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
this jay takes care that fact so that these coefficients

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
are in fact real so what this says

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
is that for the antisymmetric square wave the

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
it in effect the forty a series is a sign series

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the antisymmetric square wave is an odd function

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
sinusoids are not are odd functions and so this is all kinda reasonable that

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
we're building

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
odd function ido odd functions

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
as an additional aside which a I won't

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
exploit or refer to any further here

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but just draw your attention to is that another aspect

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
love this periodic square wave the particular one that we chose

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is dead it is what's referred to as a

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
on harmonic function in other words

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
for even values if K

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
before a series coefficients 30 their only 90

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
for iPad use K

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
okay now let's look at another example another example

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is the symmetric periodic square wave

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and this is in fact example

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
4.5 worked out in more detail in the tax then

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I won't bother to work work this out in detail here

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
except to draw your attention to several

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
points here is the symmetric periodic square wave

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and what I mean by symmetric

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
is that it's an even time function

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
now just kinda extrapolating your intuition

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
what we you should expect is that if if it's a

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
only even time function it should be built up

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
or buildable if it's built up a little %ah to only

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
even sinusoids and in fact

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that's the case so if we look at

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
the four-day series coefficients for this

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the zeroth coefficient again as the average value

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
which in this case is a half here I've plotted

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
hi times the for a series coefficients so

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
0 thank you as pie over to

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the coefficients are now and even sequence

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and in in other words symmetric

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
about cake 0 and the consequences that

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is that when you take these coefficients

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and put together the equivalent triggered a metric form

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
the triggered a metric for involves

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
only cosines and no

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
sign turns now

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you'll see this in and other examples not that will do in the lecture but

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
examples in the text in the video manual if in fact

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the square way was neither symmetric or antisymmetric

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
then the trigonometric form would involve both

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
sines and cosines and

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
that is of course the more general case

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
furthermore in the two examples are shown here

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
we we in both cases

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the signal is odd harmonic

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
in other words for even bad news K

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
the coefficients are equal to 0 although I won't justify that here that's a

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
consequence that the fact that

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
this symmetry is exactly about half a period

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and if you made the on time with a square wave

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
different in relation to the of time then that property would also

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
disappear

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
now

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
what's kind amazing actually in

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
is that if we take a square wave like

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I have here or as I had in the antisymmetric case

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the implication is that I can bill

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that square wave by adding up

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
on of signs were cosines and

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it really seems kinda amazing because the square wave after all

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
is a very discontinuous functions

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
sinusoids are very continuous and it seems puzzling that in fact

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
you can do that well let's look in a little bit of detail

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
how the sinusoidal

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
turns and up to

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
build a square wave and to do that

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
let's first define what I refer to

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
as a partial song so

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
here we have the expression

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
which is the synthesis

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
equation telling us how accept T could be represented

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
as complex exponentials if it can be and

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
let's consider just a finite number of turns in this song

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and so X 7ft of course as n goes to infinity

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
approaches the infinite sum that we're talking about and although we could do

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
this more generally let's not let's focus on the symmetric square wave case

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
where because it the symmetry of these coefficients namely that a suitcase

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
equal to minus

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
is equal to a serb minus K we can rewrite

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
these turns as cosine turns and so this partial some

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
can be express the way arm expressing it here

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
well let's look at

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
a few the Stearns on the graph I have

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
first the ball exit tea which is our

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
original square wave

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the turn that I indicate here

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is the factor over half which

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
is this term

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
with any calls one that would correspond to anyone co-signed term

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to that and so the sole those two would be yes

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
which looks a little close to the square wave but

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
certainly not very close to it at all and in fact

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in its somewhat hard to imagine without

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
seeing the terms build-up how in fact by adding more and more turns we can

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
generate something

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that is essentially flat except at the discontinuities

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
so let's look at this example and what I'd like to show

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is this example but now as we add many

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
more turns to it and let's see in fact

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
how these individual turns add up

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
to build up the square way so

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
this is the square wave that we want to build up

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
through the forty a series is this some of sinusoids

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and the term for cake 0 will be a constant which represents the DC value

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
with this

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and so in the partial sum as we develop it

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the first thing they will show is just the term for cable 0

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
now for cables one we would add to that

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
one sinusoidal term and

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
so some love the term for cake was one cake was 0

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
is represented here now

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
when we go to K calls to because of the fact that this is an odd harmonic

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,000
function

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
in fact the term for cake was it was too

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
will be will have zero amplitude and so this won't change

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
here we show the

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
for a series would cake was to and there's no change

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and then we will go to cable 23

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and we will be adding then one additional sinusoidal term here's cake

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,000
was three

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
when we go to cable 24 again there won't be any change

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
but their will be another term that's

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
added at cake was five here and cable 6

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
again because it's odd harmonic no change and finally cable 7

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
is shown here okay and we can begin to see that

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
this starts to look somewhat like the square wave but

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
now to really emphasize how this builds up let's

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
more rapidly and Ed many more terms and in fact

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
increase the number of turns up to about a hundred recognizing

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that the shape will only change on the inclusion

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
all the odd number terms not the even-numbered turns because it's an odd

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
harmonic function so now we're

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
increasing and we're building up toward

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
k equal to 100 200 turns an

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
notice that it is the higher

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
order turns dead tend to build up

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the discontinuity corresponding to the notion

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
there'd the discontinuities or sharp edges in a signal

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
in fact are represented through the higher

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
frequencies in the forty a series and here we have

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
a not too unreasonable approximation

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to the original square wave there is the artifact of the ripples at the

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
discontinuity and in fact

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
though that rippling behavior at the discontinuities

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
is referred to as the Gibbs phenomenon

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and it's an inherent part love the forty a series representation at

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
discontinuities

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
now to emphasize this

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
let's decrease the number of turns back down

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and we will carry this down

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to k equal to 1 again

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to emphasizes how the sinusoids are building up

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
the square wave here we are back at Cape cools

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
1 and then finally we

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
will and back in the sinusoids that we took out

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and let's build this back up to 100 turns

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
showing the approximation dead

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
we generated with a hundred turns to the square way

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
okay so so what you saw is that

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in fact we got awfully close to a square wave

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and the other thing think that was kind of interesting about it is that went

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,000
along

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
was the fact that with the low frequencies

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
what we were tending to bill was the general behavior

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and as the higher frequencies came in

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that tended to contribute the discontinuities

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
work contribute to the discontinuity and

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
in fact something their will

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
standout more and more as we go through our discussion

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
love for a series of 48 transforms is

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
that general statement that its the low-frequency

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
terms bat represent

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the broad time behavior and

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
its the high-frequency terms that are used to build up

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the sharp transitions in the time domain

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
okay now we need to get a little more precise

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
about the question of how in fact

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the 48 series

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
or when before you a series represents

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the functions that we're talking about and in what sense they represent them

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
in and so if we look

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
again at the synthesis

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
ok wage in were really wanna ask

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
is if we add up enough for these terms

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in what sense does this some represent

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
this time function well

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
let's again use the notion love are partial some

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
so we have the partial song down here

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
in and we can think love the difference between

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
this partial some and the

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
original time function as

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
the ever and I've defined the error here

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
and what we would like to know is does this error

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
decrease as we aired more and more turns

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and in fact in what sense if the air does decrease in what sense

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
there's a decrease now in detail

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
this is a fairly complicated an elaborate topic I don't mean to make

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that sound frightening

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
its mainly a statement that I don't want to explore it and a lot of detail

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
but it relates to what is referred to

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
as the issue a convergence the forty a series

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and the convergence the 48 series

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
the the bottom line on at the kinda and statement

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
can be made in several ways one statement

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
related to convergence the for a series is the following if

00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I have a time function which

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
is what is referred to as square integrable namely

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
its integral over a period is finite then

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
what you can show kinda amazingly

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
is that the energy E in

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
that error in other words the energy in the difference between the original

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
function

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and the partial some the energy and that

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
goes to zero as n goes to infinity

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
a somewhat tighter condition is a condition referred to as it the racially

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
conditions which says that

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
if the time function

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
is absolutely integral not square honorable but absolutely integral

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and I've kinda hedge the issue by just simply referred to accept T as being

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
well behaved

00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
then the statement is dead the error in fact goes to zero

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
as and increases except at the discontinuities

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and what well-behaved means in that statement

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is that as discussed in the book there are a finite number

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
maxima and minima in any period and a finite number finite discontinuities

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
which is essentially

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
always the case so under square in Accra bility

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
what we have is the statement not that the partial sum goes to the right value

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
at every point

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
but that the energy in the air goes to zero

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
under the jewish way conditions it says that in fact the signal goes to the

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
right back to you

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
at every time instant except

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
at the discontinuities so

00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
going back to the square wave

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the square wave satisfies either one of those conditions and so

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
what the consequences is that with the square wave

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
if we looked at the error then in fact

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
what we would find is that the energy

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
in the error would go to zero as we at

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
more and more turns in the partial some and in fact

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
if says the square wave also satisfies the dish les conditions

00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the actual value with the air the difference between

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
the partial some and the true value will will

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
actually go to zero that difference will go to zero

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
except at the discontinuities and

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
that in fact is kinda evident as

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
we watch the function build-up

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
by adding up these terms and so in fact

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
let's go back and see again

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the development the partial sons

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
in relation to the original time function let's observe

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
this time again basically what we saw before which is that it builds up

00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
to the right answer and furthermore what will plot this time also as a function

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
of time

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
is the energy in the air and what we'll see is that the energy in the air

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
will be tending toward zero as the number

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
turns increases so

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
once again we have the square wave and

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
we want to again show the buildup of the

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
forty a series this time showing also

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
how the energy in the air decreases as we had more and more turns

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
well once again will begin

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
with cake was 0 corresponding to the constant term

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and was shown on the bottom trace is

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the energy in the air between those two and

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
will then and the term for cables 1

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
to the DC term and will see that the energy will decrease

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
when we do that here we have then the summer

00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
cake 10 cables 1 now

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
with cables to the energy won't decrease

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
any further because it's an odd harmonic function

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
that's what we've just added in when we add in the term for cables 3

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
again will see the energy in the air decrease

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
as reflected in the bottom curve

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
so there we are at cables 3 when

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
we go to cable 24 there again is no change in the air

00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
at cables 5 again the air decreases

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
k equal to 6% know there will be no change again

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
an 8k course 7 the energy decreases

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and now let's show the how the air decreases by building up the number

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
turns much more rapidly already the air has gotten somewhat small on the scale

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
in which were showing it so let's expand out

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
the ever scale the vertical axis

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
displaying the energy in the error so that we could watch

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
how the energy decreases as

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
we had more and more terms so here we have

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the vertical scale expanded and

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
now what we'll do is increase

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
the number of turns in the forty a series and watch the energy in the air

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
at decreasing

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
always decreasing of course on the inclusion

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
love the odd number turns and

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
not on the inclusion of the even-numbered turns because the fact

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that it's an odd harmonic function now the energy in the air

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
asymptotically will approach 0 although

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
point by point the forty a series will never be equal to the square wave

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
it will at every instant of time

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
except at the discontinuities where there will always be

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
some ripple corresponding to

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
what's referred to as the Gibbs phenomenon

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
okay well so what we've seen in is

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
a and a quick look at the Fourier series

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
representation love periodic signals

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
we more broadly

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
wanna have a more general representation

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
love oath signals in terms of complex exponentials and so our next step

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
will be to move toward a representation

00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'll not periodic or a periodic signals

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
now the details if this I leave for the next lecture

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
the only thought that I want introduced at this point

00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
is the basic strategy you which

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
is somewhat amazing and kinda interesting to reflect on

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
in the interim the basic strategy

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
with in a periodic signal is

00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
to think love representing

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
this a periodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
by this simple trick all

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
periodically replicating this signal

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
generating a periodic signal

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
using a Fourier series representation

00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
for that periodic signal and then

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
simply letting the period go to infinity

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
as the period goes to infinity that periodic signal becomes the original

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
a periodic one that we have before and a 40 a series

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
representation then becomes what we refer to as the Fourier transform so

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
that's just a quick look at kind of the basic idea

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and approach that will take in the next lecture will develop this

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
a little more carefully more fully moving from the 40 a series which we've

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
used for periodic signals

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
to develop the for EA transform

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
which will then be representation for a periodic see

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
thank you
