in

the No

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,900 
for last time

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,480 
we began to address the issue a building
continuous-time signals out a linear

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,920 
combination of complex exponentials

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,770 
and for the class a periodic signals

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,200 
specifically what this led to was the
Fourier series representation

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,450 
for periodic signals let me just
summarize

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,850 
the result that we develop last time for

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,259 
periodic signals we had the
continuous-time for you

20
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,680 
for a series where we built

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,570 
the periodic signal I dove a linear
combination

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,369 
love harmonically related complex
exponentials

23
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,720 
and what that led to was what we refer
to as

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560 
the synthesis equation and we

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,619 
briefly address the issue love when this
in fact bills

26
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,580 
when this in fact is a complete
representation at the periodic signal

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,820 
and in essence what we presented was

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,369 
conditions either Forex city being
square integrable

29
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,369 
or X-eighty being absolutely inevitable

30
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,939 
then the other cited the for a series

31
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,989 
is what I refer to as the analysis
equation

32
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,930 
and the analysis equation was the
equation the told us how

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,239 
we yet the forty a series coefficients

34
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,980 
from x50 and so this equation

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,269 
together with the synthesis equation
represent

36
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,950 
the forty a series description for
periodic signals

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,500 
now we'd like to do is

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500 
extend this idea to provide a mechanism

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,570 
for building not periodic signals also I
have a linear combination

40
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,720 
complex exponentials and the

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,209 
basic idea behind doing this is very
simple

42
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,549 
and also very clever as i indicated last
time essentially

43
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:57,150 
the thought is the following if we have
a non periodic signal or a periodic

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,840 
signal

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,930 
we can think love constructing a
periodic signal

46
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,889 
by simply periodically replicating

47
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,900 
that a periodic signal so

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,220 
for example if I have in a periodic
signal

49
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,030 
as i've indicated here I can consider

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,359 
building a periodic signal where

51
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,570 
I simply take this original signal

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,669 
and repeated at multiples love some
period t0

53
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,840 
now two things to recognize about this
one

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,030 
is that the periodic signal

55
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,480 
is equal to the a periodic signal

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,519 
over one period and the second is that
as the period

57
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,690 
goes to infinity then in fact

58
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,019 
the periodic signal goes to

59
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,190 
the a periodic signal so

60
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,760 
the basic idea then is

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,320 
to use the free a series to represent

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,190 
the periodic signal and then examine the
4e a serious expression

63
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,370 
as we let the period go to infinity well

64
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,239 
let's quickly see how this develops

65
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,600 
interns up the Associated equations here

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,940 
again we have the periodic

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,850 
signal and what we want to inquire

68
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,150 
into is what happens to the forty a
serious expression for this

69
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,000 
as we let the period go to infinity as
that happens

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,100 
whatever for a series representation we
end up with

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,630 
will correspond also to a representation
for this a periodic signal

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,840 
well let's see the forty a series

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,220 
synthesis expressions for the periodic
signal expresses

74
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,949 
extol dirty the periodic signal as a
linear combination

75
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,389 
of harmonically related complex
exponentials

76
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,479 
with the fundamental frequency Omega 0

77
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,240 
equal to 25 divided by the period and

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,740 
the analysis equation tells us

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,350 
what the relationship is for the
coefficients

80
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,990 
interns are the periodic signal now I
indicated

81
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,450 
that the periodic signal and the a
periodic signal

82
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,600 
are equal over one period we recognize

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,460 
that this integration in fact only
occurs over one period

84
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,580 
and so we can really express this
interns

85
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,340 
all our original a periodic signal so
this tells us the for a series

86
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,570 
coefficients

87
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,759 
interns affect safety

88
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,770 
okay now

89
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,880 
if in we look at this expression which
is the expression for the 4e

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,980 
coefficients the a periodic signal one
other things to recognize

91
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,240 
is dead in effect what

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,820 
this represents are samples

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,430 
all an integral where

94
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,450 
we can think all the variable Omega

95
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,660 
taking on values better integer
multiples

96
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,240 
Omega 0 said another way let's define a
function as i've indicated here

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240 
which is this in a brawl where

98
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,410 
and we may think it will make a as being
a continuous variable

99
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,190 
and then the forty a series coefficients
correspond

100
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,770 
to substituting Omega

101
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,040 
is for Omega K

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,380 
Omega 0 now one reason for doing that as
we'll see is that in fact

103
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,210 
this will turn out to provide us with
the mechanism

104
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,870 
for forty-a representation affect safety

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,190 
and this in fact and is an on below

106
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,360 
all the four EA series coefficients

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,600 
in other words t0 the period times the
coefficients

108
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,960 
is equal so this integral at integer
multiples

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,010 
Omega 0

110
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,090 
okay so this effect tells us how to get
the for a series coefficients the

111
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,380 
periodic signal

112
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,140 
interns love samples of an envelope and
that will become a very important notion

113
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,150 
shortly and in

114
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,240 
that in effect will correspond to an
analysis equation

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,759 
to represent the a periodic signal now
let's look at the synthesis equation

116
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,649 
group call that in the synthesis our
strategy is

117
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,209 
to build a periodic signal and let the
period go to infinite

118
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,089 
well here is the expression

119
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,459 
for the synthesis the periodic signal

120
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,769 
now expressed interns

121
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:57,879 
I'll samples of this envelope function

122
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,059 
and where I've simply use the fact that
the substitution

123
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:08,300 
that t0 is to pile for Omega 0 and so I
have an Omega 0 here

124
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,619 
and a 1-over to pie and the reason for
doing that

125
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:16,899 
as we'll see in a minute is that this
then turns into an integral

126
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,529 
specifically then the synthesis equation

127
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,879 
that we have is

128
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,399 
what i've indicated here we would now
want to examine this

129
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,569 
as the period goes to infinity which
means that

130
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,599 
Omega 0 becomes infinitesimally small

131
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,889 
and without dwelling on the details

132
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:42,800 
and with my suggesting that you give
this a fair amount of reflection

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,319 
in fact what happens as the period goes
to infinity

134
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,720 
is that this some Asian approach is an
integral

135
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,009 
over Omega where Omega 0 becomes the
differential

136
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,309 
and Omega and the periodic signal of
course

137
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,459 
approaches the a periodic sick so

138
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,170 
the resulting equation that we get outta

139
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,529 
the original for a series synthesis
equation

140
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,350 
is the equation

141
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,879 
that I indicate down here X if T

142
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,730 
synthesized interns all this

143
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,339 
integral which is what the forty a
series approaches

144
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,519 
as Omega 0 goes to zero and

145
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,629 
we had previously that XO maker

146
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,410 
was in fact an envelope function

147
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,769 
and we have then the corresponding for
EA transform analysis equation

148
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,149 
which tells us how we arrive at that
envelope

149
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,559 
interns love accept T okay so

150
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,779 
we now have and analysis equation and

151
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,870 
synthesis equation which in effect
expresses 4s

152
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,120 
how to build XFT interns or

153
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,429 
if into tears and we finally space
complex exponentials

154
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:09,040 
the strategy to review it

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,120 
and which I'd like to illustrate with

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,259 
a succession of overlays was

157
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,029 
to begin up

158
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,019 
with are a periodic signal as

159
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,440 
I indicate here

160
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,160 
and then reconstructed from that a
periodic signal

161
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,230 
and in this periodic signal has a forty
a series

162
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,710 
and we express the for a series
coefficients if this

163
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,330 
as samples all an envelope function

164
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,680 
the envelope function is what I indicate
on the curve below

165
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,930 
so this is the envelope above the 40 a
series coefficients

166
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,870 
for example if the period t0

167
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,180 
was four times t1 in the 4a series
coefficients

168
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,380 
that we would end up with is this set

169
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,810 
samples of the and below if

170
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,950 
instead we double that period

171
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,100 
then the Fourier series coefficients
that we end up with

172
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,200 
are more finally space

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,940 
and as t0

174
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,310 
continues to increase we get more and
more

175
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,260 
finally space samples love this envelope
function

176
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,770 
and as t0 goes to infinity in fact what
we get

177
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,070 
is every single point on the envelope
and that provides is

178
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,090 
with the representation for

179
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,190 
the a periodic sick let me just to

180
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,700 
really emphasize the point

181
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,300 
show this example once again but now

182
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,840 
let's look at it dynamically on the
computer display

183
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,770 
so here we have the square wave in below
it

184
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,740 
the for a series coefficients we now
want to look at the for a series

185
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,810 
coefficients

186
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:12,810 
as the period at the square wave starts
to increase

187
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,690 
and what we see is that these look

188
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,780 
like samples love an envelope

189
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,920 
and in fact the envelope for the Fourier
series coefficients

190
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,010 
is shown in the bottom trace and
emphasize in fact that it is the

191
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,810 
envelope

192
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,660 
let's superimpose it on top of the
Fourier series coefficients that we've

193
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,660 
generated so far

194
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,550 
okay now let's increase the period

195
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,360 
even further and we'll see the for a
series

196
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,420 
coefficients billion under that

197
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,100 
envelope function even more and in fact

198
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,950 
as the period gets large enough what we

199
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,960 
begin to get a sense love is

200
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,680 
that we're sampling more and more
finally

201
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,840 
this and below and in fact in the limit
as the period goes off to infinity

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,160 
the samples basically will represent
every

203
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,810 
single point on the envelope well this
is about as far as you want to go

204
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,900 
let's once again plot the envelope
function

205
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,920 
and again to emphasize that we've
generated samples a bad

206
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,920 
let superimpose that on the forty a
series coefficients

207
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,870 
okay so what we have then is

208
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,960 
now are forty-a transform

209
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,220 
representation the continuous time
Fourier transform

210
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,760 
with the synthesis equation

211
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,110 
expressed as an integral as they've
indicated here

212
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,200 
and this integral is what

213
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,300 
the four th series some went to

214
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,710 
as we let the period go to infinity

215
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,860 
where the frequency go to zero the
corresponding

216
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,440 
analysis equation which we have here the
analysis equation

217
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,490 
being the expression for the on below

218
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,950 
up to 40 a series coefficients for the
periodically

219
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,630 
replicated signal and in shorthand
notation

220
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,889 
we would think affects if T

221
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,029 
and its Fourier transform as a pair

222
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,970 
as i've indicated here and the Fourier
transform

223
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,660 
as will emphasize in several examples
and certainly

224
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,389 
as is consistent with the forty a series
is

225
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,540 
a complex value function even when
accepting israel's so would accept the

226
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,230 
real

227
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,410 
we end up with the 48 transform which is
a complex function

228
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,309 
just as the for you series coefficients
were complex

229
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:08,250 
for real value time function

230
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,040 
so we could alternatively as with the 4e
a series

231
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,950 
express the Fourier transform it turns

232
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,350 
love its real part an imaginary part

233
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,610 
or alternatively interns

234
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,250 
love its magnet to and its angle

235
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,640 
all right now let's look at an example

236
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,080 
love a time function and its Fourier
transform

237
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,149 
and so let's consider

238
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,630 
an example which in fact is an example
worked out in the tax that's

239
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,540 
example 4.7 tax and missus are all
familiar friend

240
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,509 
the exponential

241
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:54,279 
its Fourier transform is the integral
from minus infinity plus infinity X

242
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:54,980 
thirty

243
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,619 
either the minus J Omega TDT and

244
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:02,540 
so if we substitute in exit to the and

245
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,720 
combine these two exponentials together
these two exponentials

246
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,179 
combined are he to the minus the

247
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,629 
times a-plus jail mega and

248
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,899 
if we carry out the integration

249
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,069 
love this we end up with the expression

250
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,169 
indicated here and provided

251
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,600 
now in this is important provided

252
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,179 
that a is greater than 0

253
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,019 
and at the upper limit this exponential
become 0

254
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,799 
at the lower limit of course it's one
and so

255
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,269 
what we have finally is the for the

256
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,399 
Fourier transform expression one over a
plus

257
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,020 
jail make

258
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,060 
okay now this Fourier transform as i
indicated

259
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,350 
is a complex valued function let's just

260
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,690 
take a look at what it looks like
graphically

261
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,259 
we have

262
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:10,429 
the expression the Fourier transform
pair

263
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,009 
either the minus eighty times a step and
its forty-eight transformers one over

264
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,139 
a place J Omega and I indicated

265
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:21,610 
dead that's true for a greater than 0

266
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,919 
now in the expression that we just
worked out

267
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,090 
if a is less than 0 in fact the

268
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,379 
the expression doesn't converge the

269
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:37,450 
to the -84 a negative

270
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,940 
as he goes to infinity blows up

271
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,399 
and so in fact the 48 transform doesn't
converge

272
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,580 
in the case except for the case were a
is greater than 0

273
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,029 
and in fact there's a more detailed
discussion of convergence issues in the

274
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:54,519 
tax

275
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,610 
the convergence issues are very much the
same

276
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,679 
the Fourier transform as they are for
the four th series in fact that's not

277
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,100 
surprising because

278
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,159 
we develop the Fourier transform out of
consideration

279
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,929 
for you series so the convergence
conditions as you'll see as you refer a

280
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:11,669 
detailed

281
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,059 
tax relate to whether the time function
is

282
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,110 
absolutely integral under one set of
conditions

283
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,290 
and square integrable under another set
of conditions

284
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,379 
okay now if we plot the Fourier
transform

285
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:30,879 
let's first consider the shape at the
time function

286
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,360 
and as i indicated way restricting the
time function

287
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,559 
so that the exponential factor is
positive in other words you the -80

288
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,019 
detainees as he goes to infinity the
magnitude

289
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,220 
or the for EA transform

290
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,509 
is as i indicate here and

291
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:54,590 
the phase below it and

292
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,919 
think there are a number of things that
we can see about

293
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,029 
the magnitude and phase

294
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:05,190 
the 48 transform for this example which
in fact we'll see

295
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,100 
in the next lecture are properties that
apply more generally

296
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,799 
for example the fact that the 48
transform magnitude is an even function

297
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,850 
frequency and the phase is an odd
function of frequency

298
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,559 
now let me also draw your attention

299
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,590 
so the fact there'd on this curve we
have

300
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,470 
both positive frequencies and negative
frequencies

301
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,019 
in other words in our expression for the
48 transform

302
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,019 
we've it requires both or make a
positive

303
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:46,519 
and Omega negative this of course was
exactly the same in the case

304
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,450 
the for a series and the reason you
should

305
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,090 
recalling keep in mind is related to the
fact that we're building our signals

306
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,880 
out of complex exponentials which
require both

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,149 
positive values have Omega and negative
values Omega alternatively if we chose

308
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:09,450 
another representation which turns and
occasionally to be much more difficult

309
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,659 
namely sines and cosines that we would
in fact

310
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,330 
only consider positive frequencies so
it's important to keep in mind

311
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,649 
that in our case both with the for a
series in the 48 transform

312
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:26,070 
we deal and require both positive and
negative frequencies

313
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,900 
in order to build their signals

314
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,760 
now in the graphical representation that
I shown here

315
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,460 
I've chosen a linear amplitude scale

316
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,540 
and a linear frequency scale and thats
one

317
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,110 
graphical representation the Fourier
transform

318
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,570 
that will typically use is another one

319
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,810 
that very commonly arises and

320
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,600 
which all just briefly indicate for this
example

321
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,430 
and that is was referred to

322
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,710 
as a boat imply in which the

323
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,930 
magnet to is displayed on a large
amplitude in like frequency scale

324
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,940 
in the phase is displayed on a lock
frequency scale

325
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,370 
let me show you what I me here is

326
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,870 
the general expression for the boat
reply body plot

327
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,900 
expresses 4s the amp with two interns

328
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,900 
the longer them to the base 10 the
magnitude

329
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,310 
and it also expresses the angle in both
cases

330
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,190 
express as as a function

331
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,550 
love a logarithmic speak with yes so

332
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,670 
here is the amplitude

333
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,910 
as i've displayed at and

334
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,580 
this is a log magnitude scale a
logarithmic

335
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,500 
frequency scale as indicated by the fact
that as we move

336
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,210 
include equal increments along this axis
we change

337
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,730 
frequency by a factor 10 and

338
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,940 
similarly what we

339
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,430 
have is a display for the phase again

340
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,580 
on a light frequency scale and I
indicated

341
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,960 
dead there is a symmetry to the Fourier
transform

342
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,240 
and so in fact we can infer from this
particular picture

343
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,310 
what it looks like to the negative
frequencies as well as for the positive

344
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,960 
returns

345
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,030 
okay now

346
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,649 
what we've

347
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:37,870 
done so far is to develop

348
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,350 
the for EA transform on the basis

349
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,190 
the Fourier transform it a periodic
signal on the basis

350
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,539 
periodically repeating it and
recognizing

351
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,889 
that the for a series coefficients are
samples of an envelope

352
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:57,759 
on an envelope and that these become
more finally space

353
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,769 
as frequency increases and in fact

354
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:03,909 
we can go back to are

355
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:07,090 
original equation

356
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,909 
in which we developed an envelope
function

357
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,600 
and what we had indicated

358
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,710 
is dead the 4e a series

359
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,039 
coefficients where samples of this
envelope

360
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,620 
we then

361
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,870 
to find this envelope as

362
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,380 
the Fourier transform all this a
periodic signal so

363
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,360 
that provided us with the way and it was
a mechanism

364
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,630 
for getting a representation for a
periodic sick

365
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,050 
now suppose that we have instead

366
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,670 
a periodic signal are there in fact

367
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,100 
some statements that we can make about
how the Fourier series coefficients

368
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,640 
that are related to the Fourier
transform of something well

369
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,770 
in fact this statement tells us

370
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,870 
exactly how to do that what this
statement says

371
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,570 
is that in fact the forty a series
coefficients

372
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,330 
our samples all the four EA transform

373
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,240 
up one period so if

374
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,570 
we now consider

375
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,160 
a periodic signal weekend in fact

376
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,830 
get before a series coefficients that
periodic signal

377
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,020 
by considering the Fourier transform

378
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,160 
above one period said another way the 4e
a series coefficients

379
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,440 
are proportional samples on the Fourier
transform

380
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,710 
one period so if we consider this

381
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,570 
a periodic signal computer its Fourier
transform

382
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,990 
and selected these

383
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,550 
samples that I indicate here

384
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,830 
namely samples equally spaced in omega

385
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,880 
in by multiples are integer multiples

386
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,020 
love Omega 0 then in fact

387
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,200 
those would be the story a series
coefficients

388
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,370 
so we can go back to

389
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,840 
are example previously

390
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,270 
with that involved the

391
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,850 
square wave and now

392
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,470 
in this case we could argue that if in
fact

393
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,190 
it was the periodic signal that we
started with

394
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,240 
we could get the 40 series coefficients

395
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,710 
that by thinking about

396
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,400 
the four EA transform above one period

397
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,270 
which I indicate here and then

398
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,640 
the 48 series coefficients other
periodic signal

399
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,970 
in fact are the appropriate set

400
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,690 
samples of this envelope

401
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,080 
alright now we have away

402
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,420 
love getting the for a series
coefficients

403
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,200 
from the Fourier transform one period we
originally derived

404
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,000 
the Fourier transform one period from
the 48 series

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,059 
what would in fact be nice

406
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,000 
is if we could incorporate before a
series

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,059 
in the Fourier transform within a common
framework

408
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,080 
and in fact it turns out dead there

409
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,470 
is a very convenient way of doing that
almost by definition

410
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,470 
essentially

411
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,059 
if we consider what the equation

412
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:48,759 
for the synthesis looks like in both
cases we

413
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,409 
can in effect define of four EA
transform

414
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:58,539 
for the periodic signal which we know is
represented by its for a series

415
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,580 
coefficients we can define

416
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,649 
48 transform and the definition of the
Fourier transform

417
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:12,059 
is as an impulse train where the
coefficients in the impulse train

418
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,610 
are proportional with the
proportionality factor

419
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,509 
25 for more less a bookkeeping reason
proportional to the forty a series

420
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,500 
coefficients

421
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,909 
and the validity of this is

422
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,350 
more or less can be seen

423
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,039 
essentially by substitution specifically

424
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,259 
here is then the

425
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,730 
synthesis equation for the four EA
transform

426
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:44,519 
if we substitute this definition for the
four th chance for the periodic signal

427
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,899 
into this expression then when we do the
appropriate bookkeeping

428
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,029 
and interchange the order some Asian and
integration

429
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:57,779 
the in polls integrates out to

430
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:03,240 
the exponential factor that we want so

431
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,019 
we have the exponential factor we have
the for a series coefficients

432
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,860 
the two pies take care of each other and
what we're left with

433
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,000 
is the synthesis equation for

434
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,539 
a periodic signal in terms of the
Fourier transform foreign it interns

435
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:24,090 
love it's for a series coefficients
right now

436
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,519 
we can just see this interns

437
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,879 
love a simple example if we

438
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:35,190 
consider the example love a symmetric
square wave

439
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,610 
then in effect what we're saying is that

440
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,070 
for this symmetric square wave this has

441
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,029 
set up for a series coefficients which
we work that previously

442
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,649 
and which I indicate on this figure

443
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:54,149 
with a bar graph and really all that
were saying

444
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,460 
is there whereas these free a series
coefficients our index

445
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,500 
on an integer variable K and their bars
not impulses

446
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,769 
if we simply redefine or define

447
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,929 
the Fourier transform love the periodic
signal

448
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,970 
as an impulse train where the weights at
the impulses

449
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,110 
are to Paul II times the

450
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,559 
correspondent for a series coefficients
and

451
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,590 
this in fact is what we would use as the
four EA

452
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,669 
transform love the periodic sick

453
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:36,950 
okay now we've kind of gone back and
forth

454
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,049 
on and maybe even it might seem

455
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,580 
likely going around in circles so let me
just

456
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,880 
try to summarize the various
relationships

457
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,289 
and steps that we've gone through
keeping in mind that

458
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,380 
one of our objectives was first to
develop

459
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,059 
representation for a periodic signals
and then attempt to

460
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:01,860 
incorporate within one framework both
periodic

461
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,539 
in a periodic signals

462
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,950 
we began with

463
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,240 
and a periodic signal

464
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,779 
and the strategy was to develop

465
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,649 
for your representation by constructing

466
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,580 
periodic signal for which that was one
period

467
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,980 
in and then we let the period go to
infinity as

468
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,750 
I indicate here so we have and a
periodic signal

469
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,630 
we construct a periodic signal

470
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,639 
extol dirty for which one period

471
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:45,179 
is the a periodic signal X still dirty
the periodic signal has a forty a series

472
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,630 
and as its period increases

473
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,490 
that approaches the a periodic signal
and

474
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,010 
the forty a series of that approaches
the 48 transform

475
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,370 
all the original a periodic sick so

476
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,690 
that was the first step that we took

477
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,980 
now the second thing that we recognize
is dead

478
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,309 
once we have the concept to the 48
transform

479
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,080 
we can in fact relate the Fourier series
coefficients

480
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,260 
to the 48 transform one period

481
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,910 
so the second statement that we made was
dead

482
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:32,320 
if in fact we're trying to represent a
periodic signal

483
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,350 
we can get the 40 series coefficients
have that

484
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,790 
by computing the for EA transform

485
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,750 
one period and then

486
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,910 
samples that for EA transform are

487
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:52,850 
in fact the 4e series coefficients for
the periodic sick

488
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,320 
okay then the third step that we took
was

489
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,320 
to inquire as to whether they're is a
Fourier transform

490
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,770 
that can appropriately be defined for

491
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,920 
the periodic signal in the mechanism for
doing that

492
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,000 
was to recognize that if we simply to
find the Fourier transform

493
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,720 
the periodic signal as an impulse train
where the in polls

494
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,010 
fights or areas for proportional to the
for a series coefficients

495
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,990 
then in fact the Fourier transform

496
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,530 
synthesis equation reduced to

497
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,410 
before you see recent this equation so
the third step

498
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,610 
then was with a periodic signal

499
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,290 
the 48 transform that periodic signal

500
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,790 
defined as an impulse train with the
heights or areas the impulses are

501
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,790 
proportional to the forty a series
coefficients

502
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,380 
provides us with the mechanism for

503
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,480 
combining together the concepts war

504
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,340 
notation love before you a series and
Fourier transform so

505
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,510 
if we just took I E very simple example

506
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,000 
here is an example in which

507
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,650 
we have and a periodic signal

508
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,070 
which is just an impulse and its

509
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,160 
for EA transform is just a constant

510
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,820 
we can think other periodic signal

511
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,540 
associated with this which is this
signal

512
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,270 
periodically replicated in with the
spacing t0

513
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,270 
the Fourier transform love this is a
constant

514
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,600 
and this of course has a forty a series
representation

515
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,080 
so the Fourier transform or

516
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,820 
the original in polls is just a constant
the Fourier transform

517
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,010 
love the periodic signal is

518
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,250 
an impulse train where the heights at
the impulses

519
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,320 
are proportional to the forty a series
coefficients

520
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,580 
and of course we could previously have
computed

521
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,190 
the forty a series coefficients to that
imposed strain

522
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,090 
and those for a series coefficients are
as I've shown here

523
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,139 
so on both these cases these in effect

524
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,040 
represent just a change in notation
we're here we have a bar graph in here

525
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,560 
we have been imposed strain

526
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,929 
and both at the is simply represent

527
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,310 
samples of what we have above

528
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,520 
which is the for EA transform

529
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,220 
love the original a periodic sick

530
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,359 
okay now once again I suspect that kinda

531
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,169 
moving back and forth and and trying to
straighten out when we're talking about

532
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:44,569 
periodic in a periodic signals

533
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:48,339 
may require a little mental gymnastics
initially

534
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,659 
basically what we try to do is

535
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,159 
incorporate within one framework
representation for both

536
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,589 
a periodic and and periodic signals in
the Fourier transform

537
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:04,420 
provides us with a mechanism to do that

538
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,650 
in the next lecture I'll continue with
the discussion

539
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,180 
or the continuous-time for EA transform
in particular focusing

540
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,430 
on a number of its properties summer
which we've already seen namely the

541
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,780 
symmetry properties

542
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,190 
we'll see lots of other properties that
relate

543
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,910 
of course both to the 48 transform and
to the for users

544
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,200 
thank you
