00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
love the derivative love
爱衍生的爱

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the approximation to the unit step
近似​​的单位阶跃

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in the limit as Delta the
在限额三角洲

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the duration love the discontinuity goes to zero
期限爱的不连续性变为零

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
well let's look at that if we
也让我们来看看，如果我们

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
think about the derivative love
想想衍生的爱

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
used to build the T the derivative of course is 0 for T less than zero
用于构建T课程的导数是0对于T小于零

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
its equal to a constant during this linear slow
其等于一个常数这个线性期间缓慢

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and then it 0 pretty greater than Delta so
然后0比三角洲相当大，从而

00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the derivative abusive Delta 50 will then
衍生辱骂三角洲50然后将

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
be as i've indicated here and
是因为我已经在这里表示和

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is simply a rectangle with a height
简直是一个高度的矩形

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
which is one over Delta and with which is equal to Delta and observed that no
这是一个比三角洲和与它等于增量，并观察到不

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
matter what the value of Delta is
不管什么三角洲的值是

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the area is always equal to 1
的面积总是等于1

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
now as we let Delta go to zero
现在我们就让三角洲变为零

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
what happens is that the width of the rectangle get smaller
什么情况是，该矩形的宽度变小

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the height of the rectangle gets bigger the area still remains one
矩形的高度变大的区域仍剩一个

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
as Delta goes to zero of course the with goes to zero
作为三角洲云当然为零与趋于零

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and the height goes to infinity
和高度趋于无穷

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and graphically we choose to depict that
并以图形方式我们选择描绘了

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
as an arrow where
作为一个箭头的地方

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the arrow indicates the fact dead we have
箭头指示的事实，死者身上有

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and im polls occurring at equal 0 and
和IM民调发生在等于0和
