049450~003500~the
052950~007000~over the last several lectures we developed the for a representation for
060280~003650~and continuous-time signals what i'd
063930~004820~now like to do is develop a similar representation for discrete-time
068750~003060~and let me begin a discussion by
071810~004370~reminding you up what are basic motivation was the idea
076180~004450~is that what we wanted to do was exploit the properties
080630~004510~love linearity in time and variance for linear time-invariant systems
085140~003190~so and in the case love
088330~003539~linear time-invariant systems the
091869~003561~basic idea was to consider
095430~004700~decomposing the input as a linear combination
100130~003269~love basic inputs and then
103399~004571~because I've Lenny arity the output could be expressed as
107970~004370~a linear combination of corresponding outputs where
112340~003440~saw I serve I is the output
115780~004500~due to fee survive so
120280~003920~basically what we attempted to do was decompose the input
124200~003529~and then reconstruct the output through
127729~004101~a linear combination all the outputs to those basic inputs
131830~003870~we then focused on the notion
135700~003140~love choosing the basic inputs
138840~003560~with two criterion mine one was
142400~003360~to choose them so that a broad class signals
145760~003880~could be constructed out over those basic inputs
149640~004360~and the second was to choose the basic inputs
154000~003660~so that the response to those was easy to compute
157660~004490~and as you recall one representation that we ended up with
162150~003910~with those basic criteria in mind:
166060~003090~was the representation through convolution
169150~004450~and then in beginning the discussion love the for a representation of
173600~001680~continuous-time signals
175280~003780~we chose as another said a basic inputs
179060~003429~complex exponentials so
182489~003091~for continuous-time we chose
185580~004200~a set love basic inputs which were complex exponential
189780~004560~the motivation there was the fact that
194340~004080~the complex exponentials have we referred to as
198420~003280~the I can function property namely
201700~004170~if we put complex exponentials into our continuous-time systems
205870~004740~than the output is a complex exponential
210610~003420~love the same form with
214030~003349~only a change in complex amplitude
217379~003531~and that change in complex amplitude is
220910~003760~what we referred to as the
224670~003899~frequency response %uh the system
228569~003051~and also by the way as it developed later
231620~004710~that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression
236330~005329~is in fact the 48 transform the continuous-time for EA transform
241659~005521~all the system impulse response and
247180~005619~the notion all decomposing a signal as a linear combination of both these complex
252799~001110~exponentials
253909~003281~is what the first the forty a series
257190~003909~representation and then later the Fourier transform representation
261099~001081~corresponded to
262180~003200~and finally to remind you
265380~005820~love one additional point the fact is that because the eigenfunction property
271200~003080~the response
274280~003389~once we decompose the input as a linear combination
277669~004211~complex exponentials the response to that when your combination
281880~004320~is straightforward to compute once we know the frequency response
286200~004430~because if the eigenfunction property now
290630~003080~basically the same strategy
293710~003930~and many of the same ideas work in discrete-time
297640~004760~paralleling almost exactly what happened in continuous-time
302400~003750~so the similarities between discrete-time and continuous-time
306150~004100~are very strong although as we'll see there are a number
310250~003650~a differences and it's important
313900~003200~as we go through the discussion to illuminate
317100~005050~not only the similarities but obviously also the differences
322150~004519~well let's begin with the I can function property
326669~004931~and let me just say that just as in continuous-time
331600~003629~if we consider said a basic signals
335229~003190~which are complex exponentials
338419~003970~then discrete-time linear time-invariant systems
342389~003691~have the I can function property namely
346080~004130~if we put a complex exponential into the system
350210~003150~the response is a complex exponential
353360~003200~at the same complex frequency and
356560~003720~simply multiplied by inappropriate
360280~003380~complex factor or constant
363660~003379~and just as we did in
367039~004461~continuous-time we will be
371500~004470~referring to this complex constant which is a function
375970~003949~of course the frequency other complex exponential input
379919~004511~will be referring to this as the frequency response
384430~005019~and although it's not particularly evident at this point
389449~004101~as the discussion develops through this lecture what in fact will happen
393550~003119~is very much paralleling
396669~003451~continuous-time this particular expression
400120~003090~in fact will correspond
403210~003250~to what will refer to as the
406460~003650~for EA transform the discrete-time Fourier transform
410110~004619~up the system impulse response so there of course there's a very strong parallel
414729~003551~between continuous-time and discrete-time
418280~003570~now just as we did in continuous-time
421850~003099~let's begin a discussion by
424949~004291~first concentrating on periodic the representation through complex
429240~001149~exponentials
430389~003741~love periodic sequences and then
434130~004150~will generalize that discussion to the representation
438280~003289~Ave periodic signals so
441569~004070~let's consider furs a periodic signal
445639~003280~or in general signals which are periodic
448919~003500~period to notify capital and and then
452419~003361~course the fundamental frequency is
455780~003819~to pie divided by capital
459599~004051~now we can consider exponentials
463650~003720~which have this as a fundamental frequency
467370~003040~war which are harmonics that
470410~004450~and that would correspond to the class of complex exponentials
474860~004450~the form you to the JK Omega 0n
479310~004050~so these complex exponentials then
483360~004619~as k varies are complex exponentials
487979~003530~that are harmonically related with
491509~003931~all of which our periodic with the same period
495440~003680~capital and although the fundamental period
499120~003729~is different for each of these each of them being related by
502849~003271~an integer amount
506120~005350~now again just as we did in continuous time we can consider
511470~004220~attempting to build our periodic signal I have a linear combination
515690~003149~love these and so we consider
518839~003721~a periodic signal which is
522560~003160~a weighted sum all these
525720~003050~me complex exponentials and
528770~004710~of course this periodic signal this is a periodic signal as can be
533480~004690~verified in more or less in a straightforward way by substitution
538170~003840~and of course one of the things that will want to address shortly
542010~004079~is how broad a classic signals again can be represented
546089~003411~by this psalm and another question obviously will be
549500~004370~how do we determine the coefficients a suitcase
553870~004060~however in before we do that let me
557930~003000~focus on an important distinction
560930~003529~between continuous-time and discrete-time
564459~005951~in the context of these complex exponentials and this representation
570410~003739~when we talked about complex exponentials and sinusoids
574149~004891~early in the cores one up the difference is that we saw between continuous-time
579040~001790~and discrete-time
580830~003600~is dead in continuous-time as we very
584430~004710~in the frequency variable we see different complex exponentials
589140~004440~as Omega berries whereas in discrete-time
593580~004180~we saw in fact dead there was a period this city
597760~004960~or said another way it's straightforward to verify
602720~003320~that if we think I love this
606040~003090~class a complex exponentials day
609130~004700~in fact if we consider burying
613830~003650~K by an ink to it
617480~003080~capital and where capital and is the period
620560~003110~all the fundamental
623670~005109~complex exponential then in fact
628779~004141~if we replace K by K plus capital and
632920~005859~we'll see exactly the same complex exponentials over again
638779~004471~now what does that say what it says is that if I consider this class of complex
643250~001690~exponentials
644940~003889~SK varies from zero
648829~003961~through capital N -1 we've seen
652790~003270~we will see all of the ones that there are two see
656060~003500~there aren't any more and so in fact
659560~003089~if we can build excessive and
662649~003491~I have this linear combination then
666140~003580~we better be able to do it as k varies
669720~003780~from 0
673500~003959~up to and -1 because
677459~003551~beyond that will simply see the same complex s
681010~003030~exponentials over again so for example
684040~003320~if k takes on the value capital and
687360~003570~that will be exactly the same complex exponential
690930~003399~as if KZ 0
694329~003961~so in fact this some ranges
698290~005150~only over capital in above the distinct complex exponentials
703440~003630~let's say for example from 0 to capital and -1
707070~004850~although in fact since these complex exponentials repeat
711920~004289~in K I could actually consider instead have
716209~003221~from 0 to N -1 I could consider from one
719430~004370~and or from to too and plus one or whatever
723800~005029~or said another way in this representation
728829~003260~I could alternatively shoes K
732089~003261~outside this range thinking
735350~005090~0 these coefficients simply as periodically repeating in K
740440~004230~because if the fact that these complex exponentials
744670~003810~periodically repeating K so in fact
748480~003970~in place if this expression it will be comin in writing the forty a series
752450~001350~expression
753800~004670~to write it as i've indicated here where the implication is
758470~003150~that these Fourier coefficients
761620~003690~periodically repeated as K continues to rip
765310~004070~to repeat outside the interval from 0 to N -1
769380~004000~and so this notation in fact says
773380~003240~at what we're going to use are
776620~004060~is K ranging over one period
780680~003790~love this periodic sequence which is the forty a series called
784470~003840~visions okay so
788310~005019~the expression that we have been for the forty a series
793329~004880~I've repeated here and the implication now is that
798209~004391~the AC K's are periodic they periodically repeat because of course
802600~002560~these exponentials periodically repeated
805160~004330~this indicates there we only use them over one period
809490~003420~and now we can inquire as to how
812910~003190~we determine the coefficients aces K
816100~003400~well we can formally go through this much as we did in
819500~003209~the continuous-time case in and 0
822709~003701~we do in fact do that in the text which involves substituting some
826410~003390~sums in a change in yours summation cetera
829800~003599~but let me a draw your attention to the fact that
833399~003141~this in fact can be thought I love
836540~005690~as capital in equations in capital and unknowns
842230~003890~in other words we know x7 over a period
846120~006149~and so we know what the left hand side if this is for capital and bad news
852269~003810~and we'd like to determine these constant sese K
856079~004070~well it turns out that their is a nice convening in closed form expression for
860149~000880~that
861029~005060~and in fact if we evaluate the closed-form expression
866089~003571~through any variety of algebraic manipulations
869660~003280~we end up then with the
872940~004490~analysis equation and the analysis equation
877430~003800~which tells us how to get the coefficients AC K
881230~003099~from excessive and is what I've
884329~003411~indicated here and
887740~003070~so this tells us how for Maxim and
890810~004370~to get the AC K's and of course the first equation
895180~004409~tells us how x7 is built up by the VA's
899589~003610~K's notice incidently that
903199~003851~there is a strong to our the between these two equations
907050~004110~and that's a duality that will return to
911160~003229~actually toward the end of the next lecture now
914389~003200~there is a real difference between the way those equations look
917589~003961~and the way the continuous-time forty a series look
921550~003510~in a continuous-time case let me remind you
925060~003050~that it required
928110~004510~an infinite number of coefficients to build up this continuous-time
932620~003230~function and so this was not simply a matter
935850~003599~of identifying how to invert capital and
939449~004830~were a finite number of equations in a finite number upon owns
944279~003430~and the analysis equation was
947709~005331~and integration as opposed to the synthesis equation
953040~003140~which is a summation so
956180~003130~their is a real difference there between
959310~003690~the continuous-time and discrete-time cases and a difference
963000~003180~arises to a large extent because
966180~004880~all this notion that in discrete-time the complex exponentials
971060~003160~are periodic in
974220~004590~their frequency so we have been to summarize
978810~004019~the synthesis equation and the analysis equation
982829~004380~for the discrete-time for a series
987209~005060~again x7 are original signals periodic
992269~003130~and of course the complex exponentials
995399~005391~involve the periodic their periodic obviously in an
1000790~004440~by it in contrast the continuous-time these repeat
1005230~003690~in K in other words as k Omega 0
1008920~004589~goes outside arrange that covers a 25 interval
1013509~003390~and because if that we're imposing
1016899~005930~in a sense the interpretation that the AC Kesar likewise the periodic sequence
1022829~003151~and in fact we look at the analysis equation
1025980~004419~as we let K very
1030399~003141~outside the range from 0 to N -1
1033540~003490~what you can easily verified by substitution in here
1037030~005000~is that this sequence will in fact periodically repeat
1042030~005190~so to underscore the difference between the continuous-time and discrete-time
1047220~002290~cases
1049510~003800~we have this periodicity in the time domain
1053310~004910~and that's a periodicity dad is of course true in discrete-time
1058220~003560~and it's also true in continuous-time
1061780~003420~if we replace the integer variable
1065200~003620~by the discrete-time time variable
1068820~003989~and we also indiscreet I'm have this periodicity
1072809~003870~in krak Omega 0 and correspondingly
1076679~003141~a periodicity in the four EA coefficients
1079820~004190~and bad is center properties
1084010~004460~dat does not happen
1088470~003690~in continuous-time and is bad
1092160~005460~there essentially leads to all of the important differences between
1097620~003429~discrete-time Fourier representations and in continuous-time
1101049~003211~Korea representation
1104260~004390~now just quickly let me draw your attention to the issue
1108650~006810~love convergence and when a sequence can and can't be represented at cetera
1115460~003800~a recall that in the continuous-time case
1119260~004390~we focused on convergence in the context either
1123650~003230~conditions which are referred to as where the group believe the
1126880~004650~or another set of conditions which were the the Ridgeway conditions
1131530~004350~and there was this issue about when the signal doesn't doesn't convergent
1135880~000980~discontinuities
1136860~004850~center let me just simply draw your attention to the fact
1141710~003380~there in the discrete-time case
1145090~004560~what we have is the representation of the periodic signal
1149650~003880~as Assam all a finite number
1153530~006300~turns this represents capital and equations in capital and unknowns
1159830~004630~if we consider the partial some namely taking
1164460~005459~a smaller number turns then simply what happens
1169919~003811~is as the number of turns increases
1173730~003260~to the finite number required to represent
1176990~003260~ex-dividend we simply end up with
1180250~003520~the partial some representing the fun and Lightsey
1183770~003380~were all that boils down to is the statement
1187150~004090~that in discrete-time there really are
1191240~004410~no convergence issues as they were in continues time
1195650~003899~okay well let's look at an example love the four EA
1199549~003231~series representation for a particular signal
1202780~003649~and the one that I think here is a simple one
1206429~003870~namely a constant a
1210299~004130~are signed term and a cosine term
1214429~003841~now for this particular example we can expand this out
1218270~003360~directly in terms of complex exponentials
1221630~005179~and essentially recognize this as a somewhat complex exponentials
1226809~003151~its examined in more detail
1229960~003420~in example 5.2 in attacks
1233380~005299~and if we looked at the for a series coefficients we can either look
1238679~005481~at it in terms of real and imaginary parts are magnitude and angle
1244160~005960~on the left side here I have the real part of the 48 coefficients
1250120~003740~and let me draw your attention to the fact
1253860~003240~their I've drawn yes
1257100~003819~to specifically illuminate the periodicity
1260919~005541~other for a series coefficients in with a period of capital and so here are the
1266460~001780~Fourier coefficients
1268240~005840~are and in fact its this line that represents the DCR constant term
1274080~003440~and these two lines represent the
1277520~003659~co-signed term and of course this
1281179~004000~these are the three turns that are required or equivalent leave this one
1285179~000681~this one
1285860~003549~and this one and then because the period this city
1289409~004471~the for a series coefficients this simply periodically repeats
1293880~005070~so here is the real part and below it I show
1298950~003140~the imaginary part and
1302090~003060~in the imaginary part incidently let me
1305150~003310~draw your attention to the fact dead its
1308460~003349~this term and this term
1311809~004551~there represent in the imaginary part that represent the sinusoid
1316360~003790~whereas its the symmetric turns the real part
1320150~003970~the represent the cosine okay let's
1324120~003480~in look at another example
1327600~003439~this is another example from the tax and one
1331039~003380~that will be making frequent reference to
1334419~003551~in this particular lecture
1337970~003140~and what it is is
1341110~003660~a square wave and
1344770~003810~I've express the for a series coefficients which are out algebraically
1348580~001729~developed in attacks
1350309~003500~I've expressed the for a series coefficients as
1353809~003151~samples all an envelope
1356960~005620~function and so I've expressed that as samples if this
1362580~003570~particular function which is referred to as a sign
1366150~004399~enacts over sin x function and let me just compare it
1370549~003311~to a continuous-time example which is the
1373860~003049~continuous-time square wave
1376909~003211~where with the continuous times square wave
1380120~003600~the form or the for a series coefficients
1383720~003310~was as samples love what we refer to
1387030~003830~as a sin x over expunge
1390860~003100~now the sin NX
1393960~003260~over sin x function which is the envelope for the for a series
1397220~001120~coefficients
1398340~004400~for the discrete-time periodic square wave
1402740~003740~plays the role and we'll see it very often in discrete-time
1406480~003300~that sin x over exercise in continuous-time
1409780~004450~and in fact we should understand right from the beginning
1414230~003860~that the sin x over extend below couldn't possibly be
1418090~004079~the envelope the discrete-time for a series coefficients
1422169~003481~and one obvious reason is dead
1425650~003710~it is not periodic what we require of course
1429360~003890~from the discussion I just going through is periodicity
1433250~004770~are the coefficients and consequently also periodicity of the envelope
1438020~003230~in the discrete-time case so once again if we look back
1441250~003429~at the algebraic expression that I have
1444679~003750~it samples about the sign an X over sin x
1448429~003701~function dead represent the for a series coefficients
1452130~004029~love this periodic square way
1456159~004451~now in the representation in
1460610~003699~the continuous-time case we
1464309~004771~essentially head use the concept of an envelope
1469080~003050~to represent the for a series coefficients
1472130~003710~and the notion that the for a series coefficients were samples
1475840~004079~up an envelope and that is said the same notion
1479919~003821~there will be using in discrete-time so
1483740~003080~again for this square wave example
1486820~003469~then what we have is an envelope
1490289~003071~function the sign acts
1493360~003390~over sin x envelope function for
1496750~004970~a particular value of the period here indicated with a period
1501720~003209~love 10 samples these
1504929~003021~samples at this envelope function with then
1507950~003339~represent the for a series coefficients
1511289~003260~if we increased
1514549~003130~the period then
1517679~003011~we would simply have a finer spacing
1520690~003099~on the samples are the envelope function
1523789~003490~to get the 40 a series coefficients and
1527279~004500~in likewise if we increase the period still further
1531779~005500~what we would have is an even finer space
1537279~004471~so actually as the period increases recall we use this in the in
1541750~002029~continuous-time also
1543779~004701~as the period increases we can view the for a series coefficients
1548480~004559~samples of an envelope and as the period increases
1553039~003390~the sample spacing gets finer and finer
1556429~003071~and in fact as the period goes
1559500~003830~of essentially to infinity the samples of the envelope
1563330~004170~in effect become the anvil and recall also
1567500~004370~that this was essentially the trip that we use
1571870~003169~in continuous-time to allow us
1575039~003620~to develop or utilize the 48 series
1578659~003861~to provide a representation %uh a periodic signals
1582520~003889~as a linear combination of complex exponentials
1586409~003731~in particular what we did in
1590140~004490~the continuous-time case
1594630~003060~when we head and a periodic signal
1597690~004969~was to consider constructing a periodic signal
1602659~004461~for which be a periodic signal was one period
1607120~003140~and then we developed the notion there since
1610260~004909~the periodic signal has a forty eight series
1615169~003000~and since as the period
1618169~003681~the periodic signal increases n goes to infinity
1621850~004130~the periodic signal represents the a periodic signal
1625980~003059~then essentially the 48 series
1629039~003581~provides us with the representation now
1632620~003809~we can do exactly the same thing in the discrete-time case
1636429~004571~the statement is exactly the same except dead in a discrete-time case
1641000~003500~instead of see as the independent variable
1644500~003100~we simply make exactly the same statement
1647600~003610~but with are discrete-time variable
1651210~003900~and so the basic notion then in representing
1655110~006520~a discrete-time a periodic signal
1661630~003630~is to first construct
1665260~003120~a periodic signal here we have the
1668380~004620~a periodic signal reconstruct a periodic signal
1673000~005860~by simply periodically replicating the a periodic signal
1678860~006049~the periodic signal in the a periodic signal are identical
1684909~003490~for one period and as
1688399~003010~the period goes off to infinity
1691409~003961~it's the forty a series representation of the periodic signal
1695370~003299~that provides a representation all
1698669~003541~the a periodic signal again
1702210~003069~to returned to the example
1705279~003421~that we
1708700~006180~have been kinda working through this lecture namely the periodic square wave
1714880~003320~if we have in a periodic signal which is a rectangle
1718200~004270~and reconstruct the periodic signal
1722470~003850~and now we consider letting this period increase to infinity
1726320~005120~we would first have this set of samples of the envelope
1731440~005570~as the period increases we would decrease the sample spacing to this set
1737010~001789~of samples
1738799~003781~as the period increases further it would be
1742580~004959~this set of samples and as the period goes off to infinity
1747539~003311~its every point on the envelope in fact
1750850~003929~what the representation up the a periodic signal
1754779~003731~is is the anvil
1758510~004269~okay well so that's the basic notion it's no different than what we did
1762779~003530~in the continuous-time case and
1766309~003051~mathematically it develops in
1769360~004400~very much the same way as in the continuous-time
1773760~003760~case specifically
1777520~004430~here is our representation
1781950~004209~through the forty a series all the
1786159~005740~here here's a representation through the envelope function
1791899~003880~and this is the 48 series synthesis equation where
1795779~003591~equation the equation below tells us
1799370~003400~how we'd get these for EA coefficients
1802770~003320~or the envelope from accident
1806090~004230~now extolled event is the periodic signal and we know that
1810320~003810~over one period which is the only interval over which we use it
1814130~003970~in fact this is identical to the a periodic signal
1818100~003840~its own fact we can rewrite this equation
1821940~005109~simply by substituting instead effect told The
1827049~003250~the original a periodic signal and now
1830299~004431~we can use infinite limits on this some and
1834730~003419~what we would want to examine mathematically is
1838149~004331~what happens to the top equation
1842480~004600~as to the top equation as we let the period
1847080~003930~go off to infinity and what happens is
1851010~003440~exactly identical mathematically to continuous-time
1854450~003750~I won't the labor the details essentially
1858200~003650~its this some that goes to an integral
1861850~004350~Omega 0 which is the fundamental frequency is going
1866200~003430~toward zero in fact becomes the differential in the integral
1869630~005340~and in the second equation of course this then becomes excessive Omega
1874970~003480~and as n goes to infinity then
1878450~004339~what the for a series becomes is the 48 transform
1882789~003020~as summarized by the bottom to
1885809~003941~equations so although
1889750~003279~there are is a little bit mathematical
1893029~003171~trickery year but I called trickery but subtlety
1896200~004190~to be tracked through in detail the important conceptual thing to think
1900390~000630~about
1901020~003289~is this notion dead
1904309~003951~we take the a periodic signal for periodic signal let the period go off to
1908260~000840~infinity
1909100~004230~which case the forty a series coefficients became these
1913330~003360~envelope function and incidently mathematically
1916690~003070~one of the sons ends up going to an integral
1919760~003149~so what we have then is
1922909~005031~the discrete-time for EA transform
1927940~003070~which is a representation all
1931010~003440~and a periodic signal and we have
1934450~005060~the synthesis equation which I show as the top equation honest
1939510~003200~transparency and this
1942710~004730~is the integral that the four East series
1947440~005489~synthesis equation went to as the period when off to infinity
1952929~003431~and we have the corresponding analysis equation
1956360~004939~which is shown below where this tells us the 48 transform
1961299~003620~in effect the envelope all the for a series coefficients
1964919~003421~love that periodic signal in and here
1968340~004969~represented interns love the a periodic signal
1973309~005551~okay so we have the analysis equation synthesis equation
1978860~003740~there are a number of things to focus
1982600~003480~on as you look at this and we'll talk about so its properties
1986080~003099~actually in the next lecture by it sold them the
1989179~003641~points the I'd like you to think about a focus on
1992820~003060~the fact that now there
1995880~004600~is somewhat have an imbalance or lack of duality between the time-domain and
2000480~001449~frequency-domain
2001929~003600~x seven witches are a periodic signal is a course
2005529~003681~discrete its Fourier transform
2009210~004260~Xserve Omega is a function love a continuous variable
2013470~003069~Omega is a continuous variable that that
2016539~004990~and that is essentially what represents the envelope
2021529~003351~also in the time domain x7 is
2024880~004529~a periodic its not a periodic function
2029409~004831~however in the frequency domain remember that the for a series coefficients were
2034240~001409~always periodic
2035649~004101~well this envelope function then is also periodic
2039750~004110~with a period in omega up to par i
2043860~004269~what's again the reason for the periodicity it all stems back to the
2048129~000741~fact
2048870~003659~there when we talk about complex exponentials
2052529~004380~and recall back to the early lectures in discrete-time
2056909~004370~as the frequency variable covers a range
2061279~004691~all to parlay when you proceed past that range
2065970~004520~you simply see the same complex exponentials over and over again
2070490~004130~and so obviously anything that we do with them would have to be periodic
2074620~004440~in that frequency variable alright notation Lee
2079060~003410~and will again represent the
2082470~003840~discrete-time Fourier transform here as i indicate here
2086310~003369~and sense is a complex function of frequency
2089679~003671~may on occasion want to either represented
2093350~004200~in rectangular form as i indicated this equation
2097550~004450~or in polar for as i indicate in this equation
2102000~003050~all right let's and look at an example
2105050~003039~and of course one example that
2108089~004621~we can look at is the one that has kind of been tracking this
2112710~003010~through this lecture which is the example
2115720~003119~love a rectangle now
2118839~003671~the rectangle if we refer back to our
2122510~005980~argument love how we get a for a representation for a periodic signal
2128490~003260~we would form a periodic signal where this is repeated
2131750~004560~and thats are square wave example as the period goes to infinity
2136310~004049~the forty a transformer this is represented by the envelope
2140359~003371~all those for a series coefficients and that was
2143730~003109~are sign an X over sin x function
2146839~003481~which in this particular case for these particular numbers
2150320~003580~is sin 5 Omega over to
2153900~004100~divided by sign Omega over to
2158000~003890~and notice of course as we would expect
2161890~003439~that notice that this is a
2165329~004260~periodic function all the frequency variable Omega
2169589~004391~repeating of course with a period up to par
2173980~003730~whereas in the time domain the function was not
2177710~005159~a periodic function it's a period
2182869~003061~now let's look at another example
2185930~003060~in let's look at example
2188990~003050~which is another signal that has
2192040~004819~kinda popped its head up from time to time as the lectures have gone along
2196859~005301~signal which is another a periodic signal which is a decaying exponential
2202160~003290~of this form with the
2205450~004570~factor a chosen between 0&1
2210020~003370~and you can workout the algebra
2213390~004160~at your leisure basically if we substituted to the four EA
2217550~003380~transform analysis equation its
2220930~004470~this summer we evaluate because we have a unit step here
2225400~003750~which shots this of for and less than zero
2229150~003840~we can change the limits on the some this then corresponds
2232990~004550~to the some over an infinite number turns
2237540~004090~geometric series and that as we've seen before
2241630~003070~is one divided by one minus a
2244700~003580~you to the minus jail make so
2248280~004490~let's look at what that looks like
2252770~004040~here him then we have again
2256810~003430~the expression in the time domain
2260240~003220~and the expression in the frequency domain
2263460~005310~and lets in particular focus I N what the magnitude of the Fourier transform
2268770~001420~looks like
2270190~004740~its as we show here
2274930~003220~and for the particular values
2278150~003380~Ave that I picked namely between 0&1
2281530~004010~its larger at the origin then it is upon I
2285540~003780~and then of course it is periodic
2289320~005009~and the periodicity is inherent in the Fourier transform in discrete-time
2294329~003711~so we really might only need to look at this either from minus
2298040~003299~fired upon by or from 0 to 2pi
2301339~004321~the periodicity of course would imply what the rest at this is for other
2305660~002490~values have or make it
2308150~003310~let me also draw your attention at war on it
2311460~004129~the fact dead observed at if
2315589~003260~a were in fact negative then
2318849~004111~this value would be less than this value
2322960~003170~and in fact for a negative
2326130~004449~the magnitude the frequency response would look like this except shifted
2330579~004051~by an amount in omega equal the pie
2334630~003060~and this example will come up
2337690~004590~and play an important role in our discussion next time
2342280~004579~so try to keep it in mind in fact work it out more carefully between
2346859~003980~now and next time and also if you have a chance
2350839~003591~focus on this issue love how it looks
2354430~003950~with a positive is compared with a negative
2358380~004930~okay now we developed the 48 transform
2363310~006279~by beginning with the forty a series we did that in continuous time also
2369589~003571~but I'd like to do now just as we did in continuous-time
2373160~004240~is now absorb the forty a series
2377400~004270~within the broader framework above the 40 a transport
2381670~005470~and there are two relationships between the forty a series the Fourier transform
2387140~003250~which are identical to relationships that we had
2390390~004120~in the continuous-time case
2394510~003240~let me remind you dead in
2397750~003260~continuous-time we head
2401010~007000~the statement there if we have a periodic signal
2408190~005399~that in fact the forty a series coefficients that periodic signal
2413589~003161~is proportional to
2416750~003750~the two samples of the Fourier transform
2420500~003540~all one period well
2424040~003610~in fact thats let me remind you flows
2427650~003140~easily from all other things that we've built up
2430790~004850~so far because of the fact that the for a transformer sexually
2435640~003020~by definition love the way we developed it
2438660~003300~is what we get as
2441960~004950~the forty-a series coefficients
2446910~004380~as we focus on one period and then let the period go off to infinity
2451290~004850~well thats looking at one period before a transformer that then
2456140~003570~is the envelope above the 40 a series coefficients
2459710~003770~and so in continuous-time we have
2463480~003970~this relationship and in discrete-time
2467450~005270~we have precisely the same relationship
2472720~003190~except that here we're talking about
2475910~004880~an integer variable and as opposed to the continuous variable and a period of
2480790~001850~capital and
2482640~003070~as opposed to a period
2485710~004379~love t0 okay so
2490089~003551~once again if we returned to
2493640~003830~our example
2497470~004030~if or Fri return to a periodic signal
2501500~003579~we have a periodic signal and we consider
2505079~003270~the for EA transform love
2508349~003881~one period the for a series coefficients
2512230~003010~this periodic signal are in fact
2515240~003390~samples as stated
2518630~003439~mathematically in the bottom equation samples
2522069~003921~love the four EA transform all
2525990~005379~one period so XO makers the for a transformer one period
2531369~004220~a suitcase at a4e series coefficients at the periodic signal
2535589~005240~and this relationship simply says their related except for a scale factor
2540829~005240~through samples along the frequency axis
2546069~005081~and and the chorus we saw this
2551150~003030~in the context all our
2554180~003470~square wave example in a square wave
2557650~004429~example we have a periodic signal
2562079~003861~which is a periodic square wave
2565940~003379~and the for EA transform
2569319~004010~a one period in fact represents
2573329~004061~the on below and here we have the envelope function
2577390~005370~represents the envelope or the forty a series coefficients
2582760~005880~and the for a series coefficients are samples
2588640~003360~so what we have been is
2592000~006359~a relationship back to before a series coefficients from the Fourier transform
2598359~003541~that tells us that for periodic signal now
2601900~004070~the periodic signal the for a series coefficients
2605970~003670~are related are samples of the Fourier transform
2609640~003120~one period now
2612760~003290~finally to kinda bring things back in a circle
2616050~004299~and exactly identical to what we did it in the continuous-time
2620349~003331~case we can finally absorber
2623680~003429~the 48 series indiscreet
2627109~003521~time we can absorb it into the framework
2630630~003850~all the four EA transport now
2634480~004170~remember or recall how we did at when
2638650~003630~re tried to do a similar sort of thing
2642280~004740~in continuous-time in continuous-time
2647020~003700~what we essentially did is
2650720~003970~to develop that more less by definition
2654690~003730~we have occurred we have a periodic signal
2658420~003230~the periodic signal is represented through 48 series
2661650~003840~in forty a series coefficients essentially
2665490~004730~when I pointed out at that time was that if we define
2670220~005399~and take it as a definition before a transformer the periodic signal
2675619~006181~as an impulse train where the amplitudes at the impulses are proportional
2681800~003120~to the forty a series coefficients
2684920~003140~if we take an impulse train representation
2688060~003990~and simply plug it in
2692050~003549~to the for EA
2695599~003990~transform synthesis equation what we end up with
2699589~005510~is the for you see recent this equation
2705099~003490~so in continuous-time
2708589~003770~we bad done
2712359~003041~we had used this definition I love
2715400~003419~the discrete-time up the continuous-time
2718819~004081~for EA transform other periodic signal
2722900~003650~and again in discrete-time it's simply a matter
2726550~003769~love using exactly the same expression
2730319~004050~and using instead the appropriate
2734369~004261~variables related to discrete-time rather than the variables related to
2738630~001439~continuous-time
2740069~003191~so in discrete-time if we have a periodic signal
2743260~003300~the Fourier transform that periodic signal
2746560~003100~is defined as an impulse train where the
2749660~003060~amplitudes up the impulses
2752720~004950~are proportional to the forty a series coefficients
2757670~004429~if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation
2762099~004681~for the 48 transform we will simply that will simply then reduced to
2766780~004660~this synthesis equation for the forty a series
2771440~003520~so wants more returning to
2774960~004389~our example which is the square wave example that we carry through these
2779349~001061~lectures
2780410~003640~or through this lecture we can see that
2784050~004390~really what we're talking about really is a notational change
2788440~005040~here is the four EA here is the periodic signal
2793480~003080~and below it are the forty a series
2796560~004759~coefficients where I've removed the envelope function just indicate
2801319~005530~the airport to the coefficients index of course on the coefficient number
2806849~003881~and so this represents a bar graph and
2810730~003690~if instead of talking about the for a series coefficients
2814420~003710~what I want to talk about are the
2818130~004320~is the four EA transform the Fourier transform
2822450~003850~in essence corresponds to simply redrawing mad
2826300~004370~using impulses and using
2830670~003080~an axis that is essentially
2833750~003510~index on the fundamental frequency Omega
2837260~003599~rather than on the four EA series coefficient number
2840859~003311~K
2844170~003300~okay in so
2847470~003300~to summarize what we've done
2850770~003329~is to pretty much parallel
2854099~005831~are somewhat more quickly the kind of development that we went through
2859930~004139~for continuous-time representation through complex exponentials
2864069~003571~parallel that for the discrete-time case
2867640~004840~and pretty much the conceptual underpinnings that the development are
2872480~001530~identical
2874010~004980~in discrete-time and in continuous time
2878990~003430~we saw there'd their are
2882420~004490~some major differences are important differences between continuous-time and
2886910~001530~discrete-time
2888440~003060~I'm and the difference essentially
2891500~005319~relates to two aspect one aspect is the fact that
2896819~005191~in discrete-time we have a discrete representation in the time domain
2902010~003040~whereas the independent variable in the frequency domain
2905050~004180~is a continuous variable whereas in continuous-time
2909230~003660~for the Fourier transform we had duality between the time-domain and
2912890~002449~frequency-domain
2915339~004311~the other very important difference tied back to the difference between complex
2919650~003640~exponentials continuous-time and discrete-time
2923290~005059~in continuous-time complex exponentials as you very the frequency
2928349~003010~generate distinct
2931359~004931~time functions in discrete-time as you very the frequency
2936290~003960~once you've covered a frequency interval to pie
2940250~003680~then you've seen all the ones there are two see there are no more
2943930~004590~in this in a fact imposes a periodicity
2948520~004650~on the 48 domain representation of discrete-time signals
2953170~004340~and those so those differences and of course lots the similarities
2957510~004870~will surface both as we use this representation
2962380~003979~and as we develop for the property
2966359~003000~in the next lecture what will do is
2969359~004441~to focus and again on the Fourier transform the discrete-time Fourier
2973800~002799~transform
2976599~005391~develop or eliminate so love the property serv the trip or a transform
2981990~003520~and then see how these properties can be used
2985510~004020~for a number of things for example how the properties as they were in
2989530~001420~continuous-time
2990950~003980~can be used to efficiently
2994930~004040~generate the solution and analyze when your constant coefficient difference
2998970~001220~equations
3000190~003190~and then beyond that the concepts of
3003380~003090~filtering and modulation and
3006470~003670~the both the properties and interpretation which will very strongly
3010140~001110~parallel
3011250~003640~the kinds of developments along those lines that we did in the last night
3014890~000260~thank you
