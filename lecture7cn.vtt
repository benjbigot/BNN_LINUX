00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
that is of course the more general case

furthermore in the two examples are shown here

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
the coefficients are equal to 0 although I won't justify that here that's a

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
consequence that the fact that

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and if you made the on time with a square wave

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I have here or as I had in the antisymmetric case

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
approaches the infinite sum that we're talking about and although we could do

this more generally let's not let's focus on the symmetric square wave case
这更普遍，我们不要让我们专注于对称方波的情况下

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
where because it the symmetry of these coefficients namely that a suitcase

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
which looks a little close to the square wave but
这看起来有点接近方波，但

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
certainly not very close to it at all and in fact
当然不是非常接近它在所有与实际上

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in its somewhat hard to imagine without
