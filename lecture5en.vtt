00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ha the the

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the more

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the last time

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we talked about the you the representation

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
%uh linear time-invariant systems through the convolution song

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
in the discrete-time case and the convolution integral in the

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
continuous-time

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
case now although the derivation was relatively straightforward

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in fact the result is really kind of amazing because

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
what it tells us is that for linear time-invariant systems

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
if we know the response to the system to a single in polls

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
at equal 0 or in fact that any other time

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then we can determine from that its response

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to an arbitrary input through the use of convolution furthermore

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
what we'll see as the course develops is that in fact

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the class a linear time-invariant systems is a very rich class

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
there are lots of systems that have that property

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and in addition there are lots a very interesting things that you can do with

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
linear time-invariant systems

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
in today's lecture

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
what I'd like to begin with is focusing

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
on convolution as an algebraic operation

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and will see that it has a number of algebraic properties then in turn

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
have important implications for

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
linear time-invariant systems then we'll turn

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to a discussion or what the

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
characterization %uh linear time-invariant systems

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
through convolution implies

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in terms of the relationship various other system properties

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to the impulse response let me begin by

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
reminding you love the basic result that we

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
develop last time which is the convolution some

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in discrete-time as

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I indicate here and

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the convolution integral in continuous-time

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in and what the convolution some more the convolution integral tells us

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is how to relate the output

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to the input and to the system impulse response

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and the expression looks

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
basically the same in continuous-time and discrete-time

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and I remind you also that we talked about a graphical interpretation

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
where essentially to graphically

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
interpret convolution required for

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
was developed in terms

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
or taking the system impulse response

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
flipping it sliding it past the input

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and with positioned appropriately depending on the

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
value of the independent variable for which were computing

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the convolution and then multiplying and

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
summing in the discrete-time case or integrating

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in the continuous-time case now

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
convolution as an algebraic operation

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
has a number or important properties

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
one of the properties of convolution

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
is that it is what is referred to as commuted

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
community here means that

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we can think either a convo loving

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
X with age or H with axe

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and the order in which that's done

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
doesn't affect the output result so summarized here

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is what the community operation is

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in discrete-time or in continuous-time

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and it says as I just indicated that

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
x7 convolved with a chip and

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
is equal to a chip and convolved

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
with exit or the same course

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in continuous-time and in fact

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in the lecture last time

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we worked an example where we had indiscreet I'm an impulse response which

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
was an exponential

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and an input which is a unit step

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and in the text what you'll find is

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the same example work except in that case

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
the input is the exponential and the system impulse response is the step

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and that corresponds to the example in the text

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
which is example 3.1

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and what happens in an example is that in fact

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
what you'll see is that the same result

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
occurs an example 3.1 as we generated

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
in the lecture and there's a similar comparison

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
in continuous-time this example was worked in

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
lecture and this example

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
is work in the text in other words

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the text works the example where the system

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
impulse response is

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
unit step and the input is an exponential

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
right now the community property as I said tells us

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that the order in which we do convolution

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
doesn't affect the result to the convolution

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the same is true for continuous-time and discrete-time

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and in fact for the other algebraic properties that I'll talk about

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the results are exactly the same for continuous-time and discrete-time

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
so in fact what we can do is

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
drop the independent variable as an argument

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
so that we suppress any kinda difference between continuous and discrete-time

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and suppressing be independent variable

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
within state the community property as I've

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
rewritten it here just X convulsed with age because

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
H involved with the ex the same in continuous-time

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and discrete-time now

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the derivation to the community property is

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
more less amount you bro which you can follow through in the book it involves

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
soem changes variables and

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in some things that sort

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
what I'd like to focus on with that and other properties

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is not the derivation which you can see in the tax

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
by rather the interpretation

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
so we have the community property and now there are two other

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
important algebraic properties one being

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
what is referred to as the associative property

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
which tells us that if we have X convulsed with

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the result ok involving h1 with h2

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that's exactly the same as X convolved with h1

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and that result involved with h2

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and what this permits is

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
for us to write for example ex-convict alt with h1

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
involved with h2 without any ambiguity

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
because it doesn't matter from the associative property

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
how we grew the terms together

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the third important property is what is referred to as the distributive property

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
namely the fact the convolution distributes over addition

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and what I mean by that is what i've indicated

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
here on the slide dead if

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think or X convo with the psalm

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
of h1n h2 that's identical

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to first involving X with h1

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
also can bombing X with h2 and then

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
adding the two together and that result

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
will be the same as this result

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
so convolution is community

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
associative and it distributes over addition

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
three very important algebraic properties and

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
by the way there are other algebraic operations that have

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that same property for example multiplication

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
numbers is likewise commuted to associative

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and distributed now

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
let's look at what these three properties

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
imply a specifically for linear time-invariant systems

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and as we'll see the the implications

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
are both very interesting and very important

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
let's begin with the community property

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and consider in particular

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
a system with an impulse response age

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and I represent that by simply writing the H inside the box

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
an input tax and an output then

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
which is X convulsed with age

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
now since this operation is commuted to

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can right is that affects convolved with a I can write

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
H convolved with ex and that would correspond

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to a system with impulse response

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
X and input H and output then

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
age involved with ex

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
so the community property

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
tells us therefore a linear time-invariant system

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the system output is independent

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
all which function we call the input

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and which function we call the impulse response kind amazing actually

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
we can interchange the role input and impulse response

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and from input or permit output point of view

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the output for the system doesn't care

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
now furthermore if we combine the community property

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
with the associative property we get another very interesting result

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
namely that if we have two linear time-invariant systems in cascade

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the overall system is independent of the order in which they are cascaded

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and in fact in either case the Cascade can be

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
collapsed into a single system

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to see this let's first consider

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the Cascade or two systems one with impulse response h1

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the other with impulse response h2 and

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the outputted the first system is then

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
X convulsed with h1

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and then that is the input to the second system

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and so the output a bad is that result

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
convolved with h2

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
so this is the result of cascading the two

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and now we can use the associative property

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to rewrite this and as

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
X involved with h1

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
involved with h2 where we grew these two terms together

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and so using the associative property

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
we now can collapse that into a single system

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
with an input which is ax an impulse response which is h1 convolved with h2

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and the output is then ex-convict all with

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the result that those two can borrow

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
next we can apply the community property

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and the commuter property says we could write

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
this impulse response that way or we can write it this way

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and since convolutions community the resulting output will be exactly the

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
same

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and so these resulting output will be exactly the same

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and now once again we can use the associative property

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to group these two terms together

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and X convulsed with h2

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
corresponds to putting X first through the system h2

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and then an output through the system h1 and so

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
finally applying the associative property again as I just outlined

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
we can expand that system back into

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
two systems in cascade with h2 first

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
NH one second

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
okay well that involves a certain amount love algebraic manipulation

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and that it's not the algebraic manipulation that's important is the

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
result that it's important

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and what the result says to reiterate this if I have to

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
linear time-invariant systems in cascade

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can cascade them in any order and the result is the same

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
now you might think well G maybe that actually applies the systems in general

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
whether you put them this way or that way but in fact as we talked about last

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
time

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and I illustrated with an example

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
in general if the system is not linear

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the systems are not linear and time-invariant then

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the order in which they are cascaded is important to the interpretation of the

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
overall system

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
for example one system took the square root

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
any other system double the input

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
taking the square root and then doubling

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
gives us a different answer doubling first and then taking the square root

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and of course one can construct much more elaborate example

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
net so it's a property very particular to linear time-invariant systems and

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
also

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
one that we will exploit many many times as we go through this material

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the final property related to

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
interconnection systems that I want to just indicate

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
develops ida the distributive property

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and what it applies to is an interpretation

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
%uh the interconnection of systems in parallel

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
recall there the parallel combination

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
systems corresponds is a indicate here

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
to a system in which we simultaneously feed the input into

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
h1 nh2 these representing the impulse responses

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and then the outputs our song and to form

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the overall output and

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
using the fact their convolution distributes

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
over addition we can rewrite yes

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
as X involved with h1

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
plus h2

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and when we do that then we can recognize this

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
as the output the system with input acts

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and impulse response which is the sum of these two impulse responses

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so for linear time-invariant systems in parallel

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
we can if we choose

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
replace that interconnection by a single system

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
whose impulse response is simply some

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
those impulse response

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
okay now we have this very

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
powerful representation for linear time-invariant systems

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
terms 0 convolution and we've seen so far in this lecture

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
how convolution and the representation through the impulse response

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
leads to some but important implications for system interconnections

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
what I like to turn to now are other system properties

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and see how for linear time-invariant systems in particular

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
other system properties can be Associated

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
with particular properties or characteristics

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
love the system impulse response and what will talk about

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
are a variety of properties will talk about the issue memory will talk about

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the issue

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
portability and will talk about the issue

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
causality and also stability

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
well let's begin with the issue of memory and the question

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
now is what are the implications

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for the system impulse response for a linear time-invariant system remember

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that we're always imposing that on the system

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
what are the implications on the impulse response if the system

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
does or does not have memory

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
well we can answer that by looking at

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the convolution property

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and we have here as a reminder the convolution integral

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
which tells us how accept an hour in a chip T-minus

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
now are combined to give us y'at

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and what I've illustrated above is

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
only general kind of example

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
here is except al here is

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
a chip T-minus now an

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to compute the output at any time T

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
we would take these two multiply them together

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and integrate from minus infinity the plus infinity

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
so the question then is what can we say about

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
H T the impulse response

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
in order to guarantee let's say

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that the output depends only on the input at time t

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
well its pretty much obvious from looking

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
at the grabs

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
if we only want the output to depend

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
on XO how at Tower equals T

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
then a chip T-minus have 0 better

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
be non-zero only at Tower equals T

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and so the implication is that

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
for the system to be memory less

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
what we require is that HFT -10 now

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
be 90 only at outcalls

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
T so

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
we want the impulse response to be 90 and only one point

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
we wanted to contribute something after we multiply and go through an integral

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
an effect with that says is the only thing they can be

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and meet all those conditions is a scale dimples

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
so if the system is to be memoryless

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
then that requires that the impulse response you scale them poles

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
any other impulse response

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
then in essence requires

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that the system has memory or implies that the system member

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
so for the continuous-time case then

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
memoryless would correspond only to the impulse response being proportional to

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
an impulse and in the discrete-time case

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
a similar statement in which case

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the output is just proportional

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to the input again either in the continuous-time

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
war in the discrete-time case

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
right now we can turn our attention to the issue

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
love system inverter ability and

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
room recall that what is meant by

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
inverted bility of a system or the inverse of a system

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the inverse nervous system is a system which one week cascaded

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
with the one that were requiring about the overall cascade

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is the identity system in other words

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the output is equal to the in

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
so let's consider a system with

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
impulse response age input is ax

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and let's say that the impulse response that the inverse system is a

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
by and the output is why

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
then the output of this system is

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
X convolved with age convolved with a stir by

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and we want this to

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
come out equal X and what that requires then

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is that this convolution

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
just simply be equal to an impulse

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
either in the discrete-time case

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
or in the continuous-time

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and under those conditions then HD by

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
is equal to the University

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
rotationally by the way its of inconvenient

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
to right instead of eight supply as the impulse response

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the embers will find it convenient of any more typical

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to write as the in burners instead of age to buy

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
age to the -1

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and we mean by that the inverse

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
impulse response and one has to be careful not to misinterpret this

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
as the reciprocal have a chip to your YouTube and

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
which meant in this notation is the inverse system

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
now if age to buy

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is the inverse of age is H the inverse have a supply

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
well it seems like that or be plausible or

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
perhaps make sense the question if

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you believe that the answer is yes is howdy how in fact

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you verified that and

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll leave that to you think about it the answer is yes that

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
if a surprise the inverse of age than H is the inverse a pizza by

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and the key to showing that is to exploit the fact

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
that when we take the systems and Cascade them we can cascade

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
them in your order

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
all right now let's turn to another system property

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the property love stability and again

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
we can't I that property directly

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
to issues related

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
in particular to the system impulse response

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
now stability is defined as we've chosen to define it as I

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I by the previously as bounded input bounded out but stability in other words

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
for every bounded input

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
is a bounded out what you can show

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and I won't go through the algebra here it's

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
going through in the book is the

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
a necessary and sufficient condition for

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
a linear time-invariant system to be stable

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it in the bounded input bounded output sense

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
is that the

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
impulse response be what is referred to as

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
absolutely so mobile in other words if you take the absolute values

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and some over infinite limits that's fine I

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
or in the continuous-time

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
case that the impulse response is absolutely integral

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
in other words if you take the absolute bad news have a chip T

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
integrate that's fine I'd and under those conditions

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the system is stable if

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
those conditions are violated then

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
for sure as you'll see in the text the system

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
is on stable so stability can also

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
be tied to the system impulse response

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
now the next property that I wanna talk about

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is the property of causality

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and before I do what I'd like to do

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
is introduce peripheral result that will then

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
use when we talk about causality

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
namely what's referred to as the zero input response

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
when your system

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
the basic result which is a very interesting and useful one

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
is that for a linear system and in fact

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it's whether it's time invariant or not this applies

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
if you put nothing into it you get nothing out

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
so if we have an input

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
accept T which is zero for all T

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and if the output that system

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
is y'at

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
if the input is zero for all time

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
then the output likewise is 0 for all time

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that's true for continuous-time and

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
it's also true for discrete-time

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and in fact to show that result

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
is pretty much straightforward we could do it either by using convolution which

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
would of course be associated with many a ready in time invariance

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
but in fact we can show their property relatively easily

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
by simply using the fact that for a linear system

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
what we know is that if

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
we have an input exit T

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
with an output y'at

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
then if we scale the input

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
then the output scales accordingly

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
well we can simply shoes

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
as the scale factor eight equal 0

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and if we do that it says put nothing in

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
you get nothing out and

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
what will see is that that has some important implications

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
interns love causality

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
it's important though wall or on it to stress that

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
not every system obviously has that property did nothing

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you get nothing out a simple example

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
is let's say a battery

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
let's say not connected to anything the output is six bolts no matter what the

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
input is

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and it of course then doesn't have this

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
0 response to zero input very particular

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the linear systems or I will now

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
let's see what this means for causality

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
to remind you causality says in effect

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
that the system can't anticipate the input that's what

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
basically causality means when we

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
talked about it previously we defined it in a variety of ways

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
one of which was the statement that

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
if two inputs are identical up until sometime

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
than the outputs must be identical up until the same time

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the reason kinda to Italy is that

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
if the system is causal so it can anticipate the future

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
can anticipate whether these two identical imports are

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
sometime later going to change from each other

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or not

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
so causality in general is simply this statement

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
either continuous-time and discrete-time

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and now let's look at what that means

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
for a linear system for a linear system

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what that corresponds to or can be translated to

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
is a statement it says that

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
if x50 is 0 party less than $30,000

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
then y'at is the must be zero

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
party less than $30,000 also

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and so what that in effect

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
says is that the system

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
for a linear system to be causal

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
in mice have the property sometimes referred to

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
as initial rest meaning

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
it doesn't respond until there's some input that happen

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that it initially at rest until the input becomes

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
90 now why is this true why

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
is this a consequence of causality for

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Lee year systems well the reason is

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we know that if we put nothing in we get nothing out

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
if we have an input that 0 perty less than t0

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and the system can't anticipate whether that input is going to change from zero

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or not then yes it must also the system must generate

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and output that 0 up until that time

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
following the principle that if two inputs are identical up until sometime

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
the outputs must be identical up same time

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
so this basic result

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
for when here systems is essentially

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
a consequence all the statement there

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
for a linear system 0n

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
gives us 0 out

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
now bad tells us

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
how to interpret or hi I don't tupac was ality

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
for linear systems now let's proceed to linear time-invariant systems

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and in fact we can carry the point one step further

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
in particular necessary and sufficient condition

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
for causality in the case linear time-invariant systems

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
is there the impulse response

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
be 0 party less than zero

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
in the continuous-time case or

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
for and less than zero in the discrete-time case

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
so for linear time-invariant systems causality

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is equivalent to the impulse response

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
being 0 up until to your and equal to 0

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
now to show this it essentially follows

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
by first considering

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
why causality

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
would imply that this is true

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and that follows because if the straightforward fact

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that the impulse itself is 0 perty less than zero

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and what we saw is there before is that

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
for any linear system causality requires that if the input is your office or

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
sometime

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the output must be zero up until the same time

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and so thats showing

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the result in one direction to show the result

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
in the other direction namely to show you that

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
yeah in fact the impulse response

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
satisfied that condition then the system is causal

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
while I won't work through it in detail

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
it essentially boils down to recognizing

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that in the convolutions some

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
or in the convolution integral

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
if in fact that condition is satisfied on the impulse response

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
then the upper limit on the song the discrete-time

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
case changes an and in the continuous-time

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
case changes to see and that in effect

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
says that bad news or

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
the input only from minus unity up the time n

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
are used in computing y van and a similar kind of result

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
for the continuous-time case why

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
T

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
okay so we've seen how the impulse response

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
or rather how certain system properties in the linear time-invariant

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
case can be converted into

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
various requirements on the imports responsible when your time

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
very insist on the impulse response being complete characterization

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
let's looked at some particular examples just

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
to and a cement the ideas further

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and let's begin with a system that you've seen previously which is

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
accumulator accumulator as you recall

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
has an output why I have an

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
which is the accumulated value

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
up the input from minus infinity up to n

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
now you've seen in the impose in in

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
a previous lecture or rather in the video course manual for previous

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
lecture that an accumulator is a linear time-invariant system

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and in fact it's impossible sponsor is the accumulated

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
bad news opinion polls namely the impulse response

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
is equal to a step

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
so what we want to answer is

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
what knowing what that impulse responses what

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
some properties are the accumulator

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and let's first ask about memory

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
well we recognize that the impulse response

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
is not simply an impulse in fact it's a step

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and so this implies what well

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
it implies that the system has

00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
memory

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
second the impulse response

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
is zero more and less than zero

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that implies that the system is

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
causal

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and finally if we look at

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the some the absolute values at the impulse response from minus infinity

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
plus infinity

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
this is a step we accumulate those values over infinite limits

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
then at in fact comes out to be infinite

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and so what that implies then is that

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the accumulator is not stable in

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
the bounded input found that out what sets

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
now I want to turn to some other systems but while we're on the accumulator I

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
just want to draw your attention to the fact

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
which will kinda come up in a variety of ways again later

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
that we can rewrite the equation for an accumulator the difference equation

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
by recognizing that we could in fact

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
write the output as the accumulated values

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
up the time n -1 and then and on the last value

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and in fact if we do that this corresponds to why

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
van -1 and so

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
we could rewrite this difference equation as why I have an

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
is why event -1 a sexy

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
so the output is the previously computed output

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
plus the input expressed that way

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
what that corresponds to is what is

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
collar workers a difference equation and difference equations will be a topic

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'll considerable emphasis in the next lecture

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
now does an accumulator have an inverse well

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the answer is in fact yes and let's look at what

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the inverse that the accumulator is

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the impulse response the accumulator is a step

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
to inquire about its inverse in we inquire

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
about whether there's a system which one we cascade

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the accumulator with that system which i'm calling its in burrs

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
we get an impulse out

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
well let's see the impulse response

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the accumulators staff we want to put the step into something

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and get out in polls and in fact

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
what you recall from the

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
lecture in which we introduce steps and impulses

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the impulse is in fact the first difference of the units that

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
so we have a difference equation

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that describes 4s how the impulse

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
is related to the step and so

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
if this system does this the output will be

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that an impulse and so if we think

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
or x2 a van

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and as the input and y2 event is the output

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
then difference equation for

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the inverse system is what i've indicated here

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and if we want to look at the impulse response to that

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
we can then inquire as to what the responses with an impulse in

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and white develops in a straightforward way

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and is Delta van which is are important point

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
minus Delta again -1

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is equal to the impulse response

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
in burrs system so alright that

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
as age in person

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
now we have been that the accumulator

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
as it infers and this is the embers

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and you can examine issues a memory stability causality et cetera

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
what you find is that the system has memory

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
the University later it's stable

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and its causal and it's interesting to note by the way

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that although the accumulator with an unstable system

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the embers are the king later is a stable system

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
in general if a system is stable its inverse

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
does not have to be stable or vice versa

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and the same thing with causality

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
okay now there are

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
a number of other examples which course we could discuss

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and let me just quickly point to

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
in one example which is a difference equation as i've indicated

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
here and as will talk about it more detail

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
in our next lecture will will

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
get involved in a fairly detailed discussion linear cut coefficient

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
difference

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and differential equations this falls into that category

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and under the imposition

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
what's referred to as initial rest

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
which corresponds to response being 0

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
up until the time that the input becomes non-zero

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
the impulse response is a to the N

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
times you have an and something that

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
you'll be asked to think about in the video course manual

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
is whether that system has memory whether its causal

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and whether it's stable and likewise

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
for a linear constant coefficient

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
differential equation the specific one

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
that I've indicated here under

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
the assumption of initial rest the impulse response

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
is into the minus two tee times you the

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and in the video course manual again you'll be asked

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
to examined whether the system has memory

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
whether its causal and whether it's stable

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
okay well as i've indicated in the next lecture will

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
return to much more detailed discussion when your constant coefficient

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
differential and difference

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
equations now what I'd like to finally

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
doing this lecture is use the notion of convolution in a much different way

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to help us with a problem that I alluded to earlier

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in particular the issue love how to deal with some other mathematical

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
difficulties associated

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
with impulses and steps

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
now let me begin by illustrating

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
kinda what the problem is and the

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
an example of the kinda paradox that sore right to

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
when dealing with impose functions and step

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
options

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
let's consider first the ball a system

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
which is the identity system and so the output is

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
course equal to the input and

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
again we can talk about that either in continuous-time and discrete-time

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
well we know that the function that you

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
convolved with a signal to retain a signal

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is an impulse and so that means that the impulse response

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
love and identity system is an impulse makes logical sense

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
furthermore if I take to identity systems and Cascade them

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I put in an input get the same thing and the first system that goes into the

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
second system get the same thing at the second

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
in other words if I have to

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
identity systems in cascade

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the cascade likewise is an identity system

00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
in other words this overall system is

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
also and identity system

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and the implication there is that the impulse response

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
up this is an impulse the impulse response if this is an impulse

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and the convolution of those two is also an impulse

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
so for continuous time we require than that

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
interpose convolved with itself was an impulse

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and the same thing for discrete-time

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
now in discrete-time

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
we don't have any particular problem with that if you think about convolved

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
in these together

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
it's a straightforward mathematical operation

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
since the impulse in continue in discrete-time

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
is very nicely defined

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
however in continuous-time we have to be somewhat careful

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
about the definition at the impulse because

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
it was the derivative a step-by-step has a discontinuity

00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you can't really differentiate at a discontinuity

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
in the way that we dealt with that was

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
to expand out the discontinuity so that

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it had some finite time region in which it happen

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
when we did that we ended up with a definition for the impulse

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
which was the limiting or up this function

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
which is a rectangle with Delta

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and height one over Delta and an area equal to 1

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
now if we think I'll convolved being

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
this signal with itself the impose being a limiting

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
former this then the convolution

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
up this with itself is a triangle

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
with to Delta height1 over Delta

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
in area 1 in other words

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
this triangular function is this

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
approximation delta sig Delta T

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
can't fault with dealt this adult T

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and since this would then

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
the limited this would correspond to the impulse response

00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
all the identity system

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
convolved with itself the implication is

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that not only should the top

00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
function this one

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
correspond in its limiting form to an impulse

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but also this should correspond it is limiting

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
form to an impulse so one could wonder well what is an impulse is it

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
this one in the limit or is that this one in the limit

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
now beyond that there

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
so kinda what this suggests is that in the limiting

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
for me kinda run into a contradiction unless you don't

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
try to distinguish between this rectangle in the Triangle

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
things get even worse when you think about

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
what happens when you put an impulse into a differentiator in a

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
differentiator is a very commonly occurring system

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in particular suppose we had a system for which

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
the output was the derivative of the input

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so if we put in extra T we got out the exit

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
the DT if I put in an impulse or if I talked about the impulse response what

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
is that

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and of course the problem is that if

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
you think that the impossible self is very badly behaved

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
then what about its derivative which is not only

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
infinitely big but there's a positive going on in negative going one in the

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
difference between a handsome area

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and you your end up in a lot of difficult

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
well the way around this formally is through

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
a set of mathematics refer to as generalized functions

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
we won't be quite that formal but I'd like to at least

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
suggest with the essence that formality is and it really

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
helps us in interpreting the impulses and steps and functions at that time

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and what it is is operational definition

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
love steps impulses and their derivatives

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
in the following sense: usually when we talk about a function

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
we talk about what the bag with the function is at any instant of time

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
course the trouble with an impulse is it's infinitely bigan 0 within has some

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
areas center

00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
well we can turn to is what is referred to as

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and operational definition where

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the operational definition

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is related not to what the impulses

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
but to what the impulse does under

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
the operation convolution so

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
what is an impulse and impose is

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
something which under convolution retains the function

00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and net then conserve as a definition of the imports

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
well let's see where that gets us suppose that we now

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
want to talk about the derivative up the in polls

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
well what we ask about is

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
what it is operationally and so if we have a system

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
which is a differentiator an

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
we inquire about it's impossible response which let's say we define

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
rotationally as you serve 180

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
what's important about this function you serve one ft

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is not what it is at each value time

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
but what it does under convolution

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
what is it doing a convolution well the

00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
output the differentiator is the convolution

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
up the input with the impulse response and so what you serve 180 does on the

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
convolution

00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
is to differentiate

00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and Nat is the operational definition

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and now of course we can think extending net

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
not only would we want to think about differentiating

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
an impulse but we would also what about

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
want to think about differentiating the derivative opinion polls

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
will define that as a function use up to eighty

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
use up to 50 because we have

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
this impulse response convolved with this one is you wanna T convolved you

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
wanna T

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and what is you 280

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
operationally it is

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
the operation such that when you can ball

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
that with except he what you get

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
is the second derivative

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
okay now we can carry this further and in fact

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
talk about the result I'll involving

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you wanna TE with itself

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
more times in fact if we think that the convolution

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
or you want it T with it so k times

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
then logically we define that as use a Kft

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
again we would interpret that operationally

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and the operational definition is through

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
convolution where this corresponds to

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
use a cave T in the impulse response

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
love k differentiators in cascade

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
so what is the operational definition well it simply

00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
that except the convolved with you sir kute

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
is the K derivative

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
accept T and

00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
this now gives us a set 0 what are referred to as singularity functions

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
very well

00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
badly behaved mathematically in a sense but

00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
as we've seen reasonably well defined under an operational definition

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
the cake was 0 incidently that's the same as

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
what we have referred to previously as the impulse so

00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
cake 0 that's just dealt T

00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
now to be completely can also go the other way and talk about

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
the impulse response a string 'em integrators instead of a string it

00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
differentiators

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
course the impulse response a single integrator is a unit step

00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
to integrators together is the integral the units that

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
et cetera an that

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
likewise corresponds to

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
a Sat Nav what are called singularity functions

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
in particular if I take string or

00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
am integrators in cascade

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
then the impulse response that is

00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
denoted as use up minus MFT

00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and for example with a single in a greater use up minus 150

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
corresponds to are unit step

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
as we've talked about previously use a -2 ft

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
our spines to unit ramp

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
et cetera and there is in fact a reason for choosing negative values have the

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
argument

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
when going in one direction here integration as compared with positive

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
values the argument we going

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
in the other direction namely differentiation

00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
in in particular we know bad

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
with uses my sms to the

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
the operational definition is the AM

00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
running into kroll and

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
like why is use a Kft

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
so with a positive subscript has an operational definition

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
which is the derivative so

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
if the Cape derivative exit T

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and in partly as a consequence if that

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
if we take use it Kft

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and convolved it with use ability the result

00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
is this the singularity function with the subscript which is the sum

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
K&L and that holds whether

00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
this is positive values that the subscript or negative values at the

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
subscript

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
so just to summarize this last discussion

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
we've used an operational definition to

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
talk about derivatives love impulses

00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and integrals impulses this led

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
to said a singularity functions work all singularity functions of which

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the impulse in the stepper two examples by

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
using an operational definition through convolution

00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
allows us to to find

00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
at least an operational sense these functions that otherwise a very badly

00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
a

00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
okay now in in this lecture in

00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
previous lectures for the most part our discussion has

00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
been about linear time-invariant systems

00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
fairly general terms and we've seen a variety

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
properties representation through convolution

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and properties as they can be associated with the impulse response

00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
next lecture will turn our attention to a very important

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
subclass those systems namely systems that are described below beilin your

00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
constant coefficient

00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
difference equations in the discrete-time case and when your car is

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the coefficient

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
differential equations in the continuous-time case

00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
those classes while not

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
forming all the classic linear time-invariant systems

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
are very important subclass and will focus in on those specifically next

00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,000
thank you
