00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the new the last time

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we began a discussion feedback

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and I briefly introduce the number applications for example

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the user feedback in compensating for non-ideal elements in a system

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and also is another example

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the user feedback in stabilizing unstable systems

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in this final lecture what I'd like to do

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is focus in more detail on the user feedback

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to stabilize unstable systems and the specific context in which I'd like to do

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
is in the context love the inverted pendulum now

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
i've referred to the inverted pendulum in several

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
past lectures and basically as everyone realizes

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
a pendulum is essentially a ride with the weight on the bottom

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and naturally an inverted pendulum is just that upside down

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and so it's essentially a ride that's top-heavy

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and the idea with the inverted pendulum

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is although by itself

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
its unstable around a pivot point at the bottom

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the idea is to applying external input an acceleration

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
essentially to keep it balanced and we've all

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
probably done this type of thing at some point in our lives

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
either childhood or not and so that's

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the system that I'd like to analyze and then

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
illustrate in this lecture now the context

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in which will do that is not with my son's

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
course but actually with an inverted pendulum

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which is mounted on a card and first I'd like to go through an analysis of it and

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
then

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
will actually see how the system works well basically then

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the system that we're talking about is

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
going to be a system which is a movable card

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
mountains on the card is

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a ride with the weight on the top and this then becomes the inverted pendulum

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and the cart has

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and external acceleration apply to it which

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
is the input that we can apply to the system

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and then in general we can expect some disturbances and I'm gonna represent the

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
disturbances

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
interns love and angular acceleration

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which shows up around the wait at the top of the rock

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
so if we look at the system then

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
as I've kinda indicated it here basically we have

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
two inputs we have

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
an input which are the external disturbances

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
which we can assume that we have no control over

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and then their is the acceleration

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
thats applied to the cart: externally or in the case so

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
balancing my son's course it's the movement my hand

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and then through the system dynamics

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that ends up influencing the

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
angle of the ride and will think

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
love the anchor the angle of the ride as

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the system output and basically the idea then

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
is to try to keep that angle at zero

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
by applying the appropriate acceleration now

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
as i've mentioned several times previously if

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we know exactly what the system dynamics are

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and if we know exactly what the external disturbances are

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
then theoretically we can choose an acceleration

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
for the card which will exactly balance the system

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or balance the ride however says the system is inherently unstable

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
any deviation from that model in particular any

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
unanticipated external disturbances will excite the instability

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and what that means is that the rival for

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so the idea then is

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
as we'll see to stabilize the system

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
by placing feedback a rounded in particular

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
by through measurement the output angle

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
process through some appropriate feedback dynamics

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
using Matt to control deceleration

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the cart and if we choose the feedback dynamics correctly

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
then in fact we can end up with

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a stable system even though the open-loop system is unstable

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
well as a first step let's analyze the system in its open loop form

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
their particular let's analyze the system without feedback

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
demonstrate dead indeed it is unstable and then

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
see how we can stabilize using feedback

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
so the system then is

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
as we've indicated the variables involved

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
are the measured angle which represents the output

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the acceleration angular acceleration due to external disturbances

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and then there is the applied external

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
acceleration on the card so these represent the variables with

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
lol representing the link to the rod and

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SFT I indicate here which we won't really be paying attention to

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
as the position of the card

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and without going into the details

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
specifically what we'll do is

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
set up the equation to write the equation in terms of balancing the

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
accelerations

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and if you go through that process then

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the basic equation that you end up with is

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the equation that I indicate here and

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
this equation then tells us how the basic forces are accelerations a balance

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
where this is the second derivative or

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the angle and then we have

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
deceleration due to gravity reflected through

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the angular acceleration times sign

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
love the angle the angular acceleration

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
due to the external disturbances and finally

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the angular acceleration due to the motion the cart

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
now this equation is written here is a nonlinear equation

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
in the angle say to T and

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
what we'd like to do is linearized equation

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and really arise the equation by making the assumption

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
dead the angle is very small close to zero

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
no other words what will assume is that we're able to keep

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the rod relatively vertical and our analysis

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
because we're winning a rise in the equations will obviously depend on that

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so making the assumption that the angle is small

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we then assuming that the sign up the angle is approximately equal to the

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
angle

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and the cosine the angle is

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
approximately equal to 1 that will then linearized this equation

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the resulting equation then

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in its linearis form is the one that I indicate here

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
so we have an equation emotion which

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
which linearis is the balances the accelerations

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and what we see on the right hand side of the equation

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is the combined inputs

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
due to the angular acceleration of the ride and the acceleration of the card

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and on the left hand side of the equation we have

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the other forces due to the changing the angle

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
so this is Dan the differential equations Associated

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
with the open-loop system the basic dynamics at the system

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and if we apply the law applies transform to this equation

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and solve for the system function than

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the basic equation that were left with expresses

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the applause transformer the angle

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
equal to the system function the open-loop system function

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
times the applies transform all the combined in points

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and I remind you again that are sumptin is that this is an input that we have

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
no control over this is the input that we can control

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and the two together of course form the combined input

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
now we can of course saw for the poles and zeros there are

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
no zeros and their two polls since this is the second order denominator

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and looking at the polls in the S plane

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
then we see that we have a pair of polls one

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
at minus the square root of G over L and one

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
at plus the square root G over L

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and the important observation and is dead while

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
this poll represents a stable poll

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the right half plane poll represents unstable pole

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and so this system in fact is

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
unstable system it's unstable because

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
what we have is a poll in the right half plane

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for the open-loop system

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
now before we see how to stabilize the system what's in fact

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
look at the mechanical setup

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
which we I won't turn on for now

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and just see essentially what this instability means and

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
what the physical or irritation at the equipment is

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so what we have which you just saw a caricature of

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
in a few graph is an inverted pendulum

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
this represents the pendulum and

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's mounted with a pivot point at the bottom

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
it's mounted on a cart and here we have the card

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and this is a pivot point

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and as you can see the cart can move back and forth

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
on a track and the external acceleration

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
which is applied to the card is applied through this cable

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and that cable is controlled

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
by motor and we have the motor

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
at this ended the track and so

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
as the motor turns than the cart will move back and forth

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
okay now since the system

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is not turned on and has no Feedback in fact

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the system as we just saw in the transparency is

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
unstable system and what then is the ability means

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
is that for example if I

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
set the angle 20 and then let it go

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
then as soon as there's a slight external disturbance

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
it will start to fall now you can imagine

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that not only is the system unstable as it is

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
but certainly can't accommodate changes in the system dynamics for example if we

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
change

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
let's say the way to the pendulum so we thought for example

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
love changing the wait by let's say

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
putting something like a glass with something in it on

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
top and I think about trying to balance it by itself obviously

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
thats part in fact I would say without turning this system on

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
guaranteed to be impossible so

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the basic system as we just analyzed it is

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
inherently an unstable system the instability reflecting the fact

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that the pendulum are following its own natural forces will tend to fall

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and now what we want to look at is how

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
through the use the feedback weekend in fact

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
stabilize the system

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
so let's first

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
once again look at the

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
open-loop system and

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the open-loop system function that we saw was the system function

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
of this form one over LS squared minus G

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and that represents the system function

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Associated with the two inputs one being the external disturbances

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
the other being the externally applied acceleration

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and the system function here

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is the represents the system dynamics and

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the resulting output is the angle

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
now the feedback to basic strategy

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
behind the feedback is to in some way

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
use the measured angle make a measurement of the angle

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and use that through appropriate feedback dynamics to stabilize the

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
system

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and so with feedback applied around the system then

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
their would be some measurement up the angle

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
through so appropriately chosen feedback dynamics

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and that dan would determine 4s

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the applied external acceleration corresponding

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to what the motor does by pulling the cable back and forth

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and we would like to choose she evas so that the overall system is stable

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
now as you recall from the lecture last time

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
with the feedback around the system expressed here

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
interns have negative feedback the

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
overall transfer function then is the transfer function

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
associated with the basic feedback loop where HFS

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is the open-loop system and GFS corresponds to the feedback dynamics

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
now that's the basic strategy we haven't decided yet

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
how to choose the feedback dynamics and that becomes the next step and we want

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to choose the dynamics in such a way

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that the system ends up being stabilized

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
well I think the thing to do is just simply begin

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
with what would seem to be the most obvious which is

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
a simple measurement of the angle let's take

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the angular measurement feat that back

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
let's say through a potentiometer and perhaps an amplifier so that there's

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
some gain

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and see if we can stabilize the system simply through

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
feedback which is proportional to a measurement of the angle

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
what is typically referred to as per for proportional feedback

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
well let's analyze the results

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
doing that once again we have

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the basic feedback equation where

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the open-loop transfer function is what we had

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
developed previously given by the second-order expression

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
now using proportional feedback

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we shoes the acceleration

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
a hefty to be directly proportional

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
through a game constant or attenuation constant k1

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
directly proportional to the measured angle theta ft

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and consequently the system function in the feedback

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
path is just simply a gainer for attenuation k1

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
so this then is the system function for the feedback

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
well substituting this into the

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
closed-loop expression

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
then the overall expression for

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the apostrophe its form of the output angle

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
is as i indicated here

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
namely that faded ass is

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
proportional through this system function

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to the apostrophe its form love the

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
input X 50 and let me remind you that

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
X 50 the external disturbances now represent the only input

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
since the other input corresponding to the applied acceleration so the card

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is now controlled only through the feedback

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
luv so we have this system function then

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
for the closed-loop system we recognize this once again

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
as a second-order system and

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the polls both this second order system

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
are then given by plus and minus the square root

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
love G minus k1 divided by L

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
so k1 the feedback constant

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
clearly influences the position at the polls

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and let's look in fact at where

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the polls are in the S play

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
well first of all with

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
k1 equal to 0 which of course is no Feedback

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and corresponds to the open-loop system we have the polls

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
where they were previously

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and if we now choose k1 let's say less than zero

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
than what will happen as

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
k1 becomes more and more negative

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
so that this term is more and more positive is dead

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the left here plane poll will move further into the left airplane

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the right half plane poll will move further into the right half play

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
so clearly with K one negative

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
this poll which represents an instability because

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
even more unstable well

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
instead a K one negative let's try K one positive and see what happens

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and with k1 positive

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
what happens in this case is dead

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the left hip plane poll moves

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
closer to the origin the right half plane poll

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
was closer to the origin what one would hope is that

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
they both end up in the left airplane at some point but in fact they don't

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
what happens is that eventually they both reach the origin

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
split at that point and travel along

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the jail make axis now this movement of the polls

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
as we very k1 either positive or negative

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
we all we see is that the open with the open-loop system

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
as we introduce feedback those basic polls

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
move in the ass plane either this way

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
as K one becomes more negative or for this particular case

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
K one is positive they move in together split move along the jail make axes

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and that locus the polls in fact is referred to

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
if the back terminology as the root locus and as is discussed in

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
much more detail on the tax there are lots of ways

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
love determining the root locus for feedback systems

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
without explicitly solving for the roots for this

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
particular example in fact we can determine the root locus

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the most straightforward way simply by song for the roots

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll that the nominator the system

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
now notice that in this case these polls

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
with K one positive have moved together

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they move along the jail make axes and

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
before they come together the system is clearly unstable

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
even when they come together and split

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the system is marginally stable

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because in fact the system with 10 docile E

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and what that isolation means is that with the measurement of the angle

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
essentially if the polls are operating on the J Omega axes

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
what will happen is that

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
things will oscillate back and forth perhaps with

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the cart moving back and forth trying to compensate

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and the ride sorta moving in the opposite direction

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
in any case what's happened is with just proportional feedback

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
we apparently are unable to stabilize the system

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
well you could think that the reason perhaps is that we're not responding

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
fast enough for example

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
if the angle starts to change

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
perhaps in fact we should make the feedback proportional

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to the rate of change Bengal rather than to the angle itself

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and so we could examine the possibility using

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
what's referred to as thrifty back

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and derivative feedback what we would do

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
is to shoes

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
for the feedback equation

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
or for the feedback system function

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
something reflecting a measurement love the derivative

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the angle and so here again once again we have the open-loop

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
system function with the river to feedback will attempt

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
to or we will use this feedback

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and acceleration which instead of being proportional to the angle as it was in

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the previous case

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and acceleration which is proportional to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the river the ankle and so the basic feedback dynamics or feedback system

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
function

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is their GFS is equal to k to times s

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the multiplication by ass reflecting the fact that in the time domain

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
its measuring the derivative the angle

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The Associated system function is then

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
indicated here and if we saw again this second order equation

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
for its roots that tells us that

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
the location the polls are given

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
by this equation

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and so now what we would want to look at is

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
how these polls mu as we very

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the derivative the back constant k2

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
so let's look at the root locus for that case

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and first once again

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
we have the basic open loopholes

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and the open loopholes consists of a poll on the left half plane and a pole

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
in the right half plane

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
corresponding in this equation 2k to equal to 0

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that is no feedback in the system

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
if k2 is negative then what you can see is that

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
this real part will become

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
more negative since K two squared here

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
this is still a positive quantity and in fact

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
then with k2 less than zero the root locus that we get

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
is indicated by this

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
now notice then that this right half plane poll

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is becoming more unstable and

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the left airplane poll likewise is becoming more unstable

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and this point by the way corresponds to wear this poll ends up

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
or where the root locus ends up went 8-2 eventually becomes infinite

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
so clearly k to negative is not going to stabilize the system

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
let's try k2 positive

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and the root locus dictated by this equation then

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is what I indicate here

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the left half plane poll moves further into left airplane that's good that's

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
getting

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
more stable the right half plain polo is moving

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
closer to the left airplane

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
but unfortunately never gets there and in fact

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
its when k2 eventually becomes infinite that this poll

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
just gets to the point where the system becomes

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
marginally stable so

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
what we found is dead with proportional feedback

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we can stabilize the system with the Riveter feedback

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
we can stabilize the system by themselves

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and a logical next choice is to see if we can stabilize the system

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
by both measuring the angle and at the same time

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
being careful to be responsive to how fast that angle is changing so that if

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
changing too fast

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
we can move the cart are here are or are hand under the inverted pendulum were

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
quickly

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
well now then what we want to examine

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
is the use love proportional plus the Riveter feedback

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and in that case we

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
then have a

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
choice for the acceleration which

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
is proportional with one constant to the angle

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and proportional with another constant to

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the derivative up the angle and so

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the basic system function then

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
with for for proportional plus the river to feedback

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
is a system function which is K one-plus K two times s

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
we then have an overall closed-loop system function

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
say to the vastus which is given by

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
this equation and

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
so the roots at this equation then

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
represent the polls love the closed-loop system

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and those polls involved

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to parameters they involve the primer k2

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
which is proportional to the derivative the angle

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and the constant k1 which is proportional to the angle

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and will

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
first have all examine this with just with

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
k to positive because well we can see is that as we very k1

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
k2 or negative that would more less immediately

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
put polls into the right half plane and the more

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
negative K two got the larger this term

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
is going to get so in fact is it will turn out we can stabilize the system

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
with provided that we to choose k2

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
to be greater than 0

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
all right now with k2 greater than 0

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
what happens in the

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
location at the polls is that

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
if k2 is greater than 0

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
every choose k1 greater than 0 I'm sorry choose k1 equal to 0

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
then in effect the influence of k2

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
is to shift the polls

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of the open-loop system slightly and so

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
with k2 greater than 0

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and k1 equal to 0 we have a set of polls

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
which are indicated here

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and so this is just a shift slight shift to the left

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
depending on the values k2 shift to the left

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the open loop holes now as we very k1

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and in particular we're going to choose k1

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
greater than 0 what happens is that

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the polls will begin to move together

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
as they did previously when we had

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
one we looked at the variation k1

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the polls will move together reach a point where we have a second-order poll

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and then those polls will split and move parallel to the Chi Omega axis so

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
with syndicated here is the root locus

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and what this represents then

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
as long as we make a one large enough so that

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
this pole moves into the left airplane is

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that represents now stable system

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
okay so what we've seen is that proportional feedback

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
by itself or derivative feedback by itself

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
won't stabilize the system whereas with the right choice

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
a feedback Constance proportional plus the rivet if the back well and we saw

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,000
that

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
basically by examining the root locus in the ass play

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
alright well let's actually watch the system

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
in action and I described it to you

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
previously basically an inverted pendulum on a card

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and so I still have it off and of course we have the pendulum

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and as i indicated its

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
pivoted at the base and the

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
angle is measured by a potentiometer

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that we have attached to the pivot point and

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the measurement of the angle is fed back

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
through this wire to motor day

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
we have at the other end of the table and

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
then that motor basically is used to provide the acceleration

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to drive the cart okay well

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
let's turn it on and when we turn it on it'll take

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
just an instant to stabilize

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
fortunately we have the cast set right and there we have now

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the stabilization up an unstable system

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
remember there with the feedback of the system is unstable because the pendulum

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
will fall

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
whereas now it's stabilized now also

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
as you can see not only have we

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
stabilized it but we're able to compensate for the feedback

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to changes in the external disturbances for example by tapping it

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
because it the feedback and the measurement of the angle it will

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
more or less automatically stabilize

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
now in addition to being stable in the presence of external disturbances

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it also remain stable in remains balanced

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
even if we were to change the system dynamics

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and let me just illustrate that with

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
the class that we talked about before let's first

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
not be too bold and will take the liquid out of the class

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and presumably if it can adjust

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to changes in the system dynamics that if I put the glass on

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
in fact it will remain balanced and indeed it does

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and let me point out by the way that I don't have to be very careful about

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
exactly where

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I position the class and furthermore I can change the

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
overall system even further

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
by let's say for example pouring a liquid and

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and now let me also comment that

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
change the physics of a little bit because the

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
the liquid can slash around a little bit it comes a little more complicated

00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
system

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but as you can see it still remains balance

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
now if we really don't want to be too conservative that all we can wonder

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
whether

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
with the feedback Constance we have we could

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in fact balance the picture on the top and

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
well I guess we may as well give that a try

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and so

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
now we're changing the mass at the top to the the pendulum

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
by a considerable amount

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and again the system basically can respond to it

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
now this is a fairly complicated system

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the liquid sloshing around we in fact as you can see have instability right now

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
although its control and that's because the physics at the dynamics is changed

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and we can put a little bit more mass into the system

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and maybe or maybe not that will cut down on the instability

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
okay well in fact what happened there is that we

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
increase the mass at the top the pendulum slightly

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and that provided just enough damn thing to do

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
stabilize the system

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
okay well with

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
this lecture and this demonstration this

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
concludes this entire set of lectures it concludes especially if the pitcher

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
happens to fall

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but seriously this concludes the

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
said lectures as we have put them together

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and let me just comment that

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
as a professor of mine once said in which I've never forgotten

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the purpose all over said have lectures or a course or for that matter anything

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
which is study

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is not really to cover a subject

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
but to uncover the subject and I hope dead

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
at least in to some degree

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we were able to uncovered the topic of signals and systems through the series

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
of lectures

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
there are a lot of topics that we

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
got only a very brief glimpse into

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and I hope that at least four we've been able to do

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
is get you interested nothin I'm so that

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you pursue some of these on your own and

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
so I'd like to conclude by thanks to you both for your patience and your interest

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and I hope that you have enough interest to

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
pursue some these topics for them thank you
