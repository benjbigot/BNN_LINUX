the in the last several lectures we talked about

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a generalization love the continuous-time

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Fourier transform and a very similar

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
strategy also applies to discrete-time and that's what we want to begin to deal

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with in today's lecture

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so what we want to talk about is

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
generalizing the four EA transform

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and what this will lead to in discrete-time is a notion referred to as

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the sea transport

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
now just as in continuous-time

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in discrete-time the 48 transform

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
corresponded to a representation

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
love a sequence as a linear combination

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
love complex exponentials and

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so this was the synthesis equation and of course there is the corresponding

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
analysis equation

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and as you recall and as is

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the same for continuous-time the reason

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that we pick complex exponentials was

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
because of the fact that their I can functions of linear time-invariant

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
systems

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
in other words if you have a complex exponential

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
into a linear time-invariant system the output is a complex exponential

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and the change in complex amplitude

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is which corresponds to the frequency response

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
in fact is what led to the definition of the 48 transform

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in particular it is the Fourier transform

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
up the impulse response well

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that said have notions is more or less identical to

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the way we motivated the look lost transform

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in the continuous-time case in the 48 transforming the continuous-time case

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and just as in continuous-time there

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it are a set signals more general

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
then the complex exponentials which

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
are also I can functions have linear time-invariant systems

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
in particular and discrete-time if

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we had instead love an exponential

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you to the Chi Omega and we had a more general

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
complex number Z bad

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the signals E to the end is also

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and I can function up a linear time-invariant system

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for any particular Z so

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and we can see that by substituting that it to the convolution some

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and recognizing again very strongly paralleling the

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
continuous-time argument head we can

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
rewrite this factor as Z to the N

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the to the minus K and

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
because it the fact that it's a someone and are some on K

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and his term doesn't depend on K we can take that term out

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and the conclusion is that if we have

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Z to the end as an input that

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the output is love the same form times

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
a factor which depends on C

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but of course doesn't depend on k cuz that is

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
some doubt as we form the summation so in fact

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
this some Asian corresponds to a complex number

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which will do no as agency

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
where Z will represent a more general complex number

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
namely see is are

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you to the jail maker are being the magnitude of this complex number

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and Omega of course being the angle so

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
for linear time-invariant system a more general

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
complex exponential sequence up this form

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
generates an output a complex exponential sequence

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
have the same form with a change in amplitude

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
which were representing as a gypsy

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
recognizing the fact that it's going to be a function of what that complex

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
number is

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and this amplitude factor is given by this some Asian

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and it is this some Asian which

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is defined as busy transform

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
all the sequence H event

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
now let me stress that and I'll continue to stress this is the lecture goes on

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that much of what we've said is

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
directly parallel to what we said in the continuous-time case

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and what we simply done is to expand

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
from complex exponentials with a purely imaginary exponent

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
complex exponential time functions are sequences

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that form into one's that have more general

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
complex exponential factors

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
now we have a mapping here

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
from the impulse response to

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the Tampa to or the Aiken value

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
associated with that input and this mapping

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
is what is referred to as busy transport

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
so a gypsy is in fact

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
busy transform of the impulse response

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and if we consider applying this mapping

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
as we did in continuous-time in a similar argument

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
applying this mapping to a

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
sequence whether or not it corresponds to the impulse response to the linear

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
time-invariant system

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that leads then to busy transform

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
love a general sequence XFN

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
busy transform being defined by

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
this relationship and again

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
rotationally will often represent

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
a time for action and it's the transform through shorthand notation

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
just indicating that accepts the

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is this the transform love accident

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
alright so we've kind of motivated the development

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in a manner exactly identical to what we had done with the a-plus transform

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
kinda the idea that if you look at the eigen value associated

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in with the linear time-invariant system

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that essentially generates a mapping between

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the sequence impulse system impulse response

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and a function of Z and

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that corresponds to busy transform here at corresponded to applause transform

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
in a continuous-time case that same argument

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is also the argument the kinda argument that we use

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to lead us into before EA transform

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
originally an once again what you would expect

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
is dead busy transform has a very close

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
an important relationship to the Fourier transform

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and indeed that relationship turned down

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to be more or less identical to

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the relationship between the applause transform

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
in the 48 transforming continuous-time

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
well let's look at the relationship

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
for civil what we recognize is

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
they if we compare

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the for EA transform expression

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for a sequence and busy transform

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
expression for the same sequence

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
dead they involve essentially the same operations

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and in fact Cincy is of the form are

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
e2 the jail maker if we want

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
this some to look like this some

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
then that would mean that we would choosy

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
equal to either the jail maker said another way

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
busy transform onesie is a to the J Omega

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
is going to reduce to before EA transform

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
so we have relationship like the one

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
again we had between the law applies transforming the forty a transforming

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
continuous-time

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
namely dead for certain set values

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
of the complex variable the transform busy transform reduces

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to the Fourier transform so if we have ecstasy

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
busy transform and we look at that

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
for see equal to either the jail maker

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and sequel to you to jail maker is

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
similar to saying that we're looking at that for the magnitude of Z

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
equal to 1 were specifically choosing are equal to one which is the magnitude

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
see then this is equal to

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the four EA transform love the sequence

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so busy transform frazee

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
equal to either J Omega is the Fourier transform

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and so this then corresponds to

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
X love Omega namely the Fourier transform

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
well we now have ourselves in a similar situation

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
again to what we had when we talked about the applause transform

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
namely a notational

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
awkwardness or inconvenience which we can resolve by simply

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
re defining some of our notation

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
in particular the awkwardness relates to the fact that

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
whereas we've been writing or 48 transforms this way

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
as external make a if

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
we were to express XZ and look at it it's equal to either the jail maker

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we end up with the independent variable be2 the jail maker

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
rather than Omega well in fact

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the 48 transform is a functional Omega it's also a function to be the jail

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
maker

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and now we can see is dead given

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the fact that we want to generalize the four the the

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
for EA transformed to dizzy transform it's convenient now

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
to use as notation for the four th

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
transform exit Z was equal to you DJ Omega

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
namely are Fourier transforms will now be written as i've indicated here

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
so just summarizing that our new notation

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
is dead the independent variable

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
on the Fourier transform is now

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
going to be expressed as EJ Omega rather than

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
as omega its a

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
minor notational change but I recognize the fact that

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
its somewhat confusing initially and takes a few minutes to sit down and just

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
get it straightened out it's very similar to what we did with the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
apostrophe in swarm

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
but let me draw your attention to the fact that

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
in the applause transform the independent variable that we ended up

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
with

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
in talking about the 48 transform

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
is different then what we're ending up with here

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
in particular before we head J Omega

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
now we have the to the jail make

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and the reason for that is simply that

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the whereas in continuous time we were talking about functions are the four

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you to the st. now we're talking about

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
sequences the form Z to the end

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
alright so in we have one relationship between the four EA transform and dizzy

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
transform namely

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the fact that for the magnitude is equal to 1

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
busy transform reduces to the Fourier transform

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
now in the applause transform we also had another important relationship an

00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
observation

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
which was the fact that the

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
applause transform was

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the Fourier transform love x50

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
modified and how is a modified it was modified

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
by multiplying by a decaying

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
growing exponentially depending on what the real part a veces

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
well we have a very similar situation with dizzy transform

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
in particular in addition to the fact

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that busy transform for a sequel the DJ Omega

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
reduces to the four EA transform we'll see

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that this is a transform for other values as the

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is the Fourier transform love

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the sequence with an exponential weighting and let's see where that comes

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
from

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
here we have the expression general expression for the transform

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and recognizing that see is a complex number which were expressing in polar

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
form

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
as are you to the jail maker

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
substituting that in this summation now becomes

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
exit Van are you to jail make it to the minus an

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
we can factor out these two turns are to the minus and

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and into the minus J Omega and and

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
combining the art a minus in with excessive and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and the in the minus J Omega en

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
being treated separately what we end up with

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
is the summation that I have here

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
well what this says is that the z transform which is this

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
at sea equal to re: to jail maker

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is in fact the four EA transform

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
allo what

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it's the Fourier transform our love xom.n

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
multiplied by art to the -10

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
so that is the expression

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that we have here and in continuous-time

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we had the applause transform is the Fourier transform

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
love X 50 you to the minus Sigma T

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
here we have the Fourier transform effective and art to the -10

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
now something to just reflect on for a minute

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is the bit because it tends to cause

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
little better problem with the algebra later on if

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
your attention is drawn to it is that we're talking about multiplying

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
excessive and

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
times are to the minus n the question is

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
for are greater than one

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
bizarre to -10 increase exponentially as N increases

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
it is a decrease we're talking about are to the minus and

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
if the matter if are is greater than one of the magnitude of ours greater than

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
one for example

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
if it's equal to 2 are the minus and is a half to the N

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and so in fact that decreases exponentially or more generally

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
the larger re: is the faster are to the -10

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
DK's with increasing in

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
okay well let's just look at

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
some examples love the the transform

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and examples that I picked again

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
are examples directly out of the text and so

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
the details of the algebra you can

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
look at more leisurely as you sit with the textbook

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
let's consider first the ball an exponential sequence x7

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
equals a to the N times unit step so zero for negative time

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and an exponential for positive time

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
in and the Fourier transform as we've seen in

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
earlier lectures is won over one minus a

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it to the minus jail maker but

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
this doesn't always converge in particular for convergence of the

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Fourier transform

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
we would require absolute some ability up the original sequence

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and that in turn requires that the magnitude have a

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
be less than 1 so the Fourier transform is this

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
provided that the magnitude have a is less than one

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and what is the Fourier transform if the magnitude a vase not less than 1

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
well the answer is that in that case it doesn't converge

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
right now let's look at the Z transform busy transform

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is the some from minus infinity plus infinity

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Aug a to the N see the -10

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
times a unit staff the unit step will change the lower limit 20

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
so some from zero to infinity and this is all the form

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
eight times

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Z to the -1 to the N

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so we're summing from zero to infinity eight times even minus 12 the N

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that some is one over one minus AZ the -1

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but in order for that song to converge

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
we require that the magnitude have a

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
time see the -1 be less than 1

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
now this is busy transform is the Fourier transform

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
love the sequence a to the N

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
times are to the -10 and

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
this statement about busy transforming converging

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
see transform converging is exactly identical to the statement

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
that what we're requiring is there the magnet too

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
%uh a times art to the -1

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
be less than 1 where

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
this represents the exponential factor

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that we have are that

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in effect is applied to the sequence so that

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the 48 transform becomes the transform and

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
so if we put this condition we can interpret this condition

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
in exactly the same way day we interpret the condition

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
on convergence of the 48 transform

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
right so from this six

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
from what we've worked out here then well we have

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
is the see transform or

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
a to the N times you have an is

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
won over one minus AZ the -1

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that works for any bad you have a

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
provided that we pick the value Z correctly

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
in particular we have to pick the center values UVC

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so that what so that the magnitude obey

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
time 0 -1 is less than one

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
or equivalently so that the magnitude of the

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is greater than the magnitude a so

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Associated with busy transform

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
of this sequence is this algebraic expression

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and this set of values on C for which data algebraic expression is valid

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and just as with the apostrophe its form

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
this range values is referred to as

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the region of convergence love busy transform

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
now again

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
as we saw with the apostrophe s form it's important

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to recognize dead in specifying

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
or having worked out the

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
d trance 4ever sequence it's not just the algebraic expression

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
but also the region of convergence that's required

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to uniquely specified

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
to emphasize that further here is example ten-point to from the text

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and if you work that went through what you find is that algebraically

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
busy transform love this sequence

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is 101 minus AZ the -1

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
identical algebraically to what we had up here

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but now with a region of convergence

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
which is the magnitude of the less than the magnitude have a

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in contrast to this example

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
where the regional convergence was the magnitude of the

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
greater than the magnitude day

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
alright so again requires not just the algebraic expression

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
but also requires specification

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the region of convergence and

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
also as with the applause transform

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
it's convenient in looking at

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the z transform to

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
represented in the complex plane

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
in this case the complex plane referred to as the

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
seaplane whereas in continuous time we talked about the applause transform it

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
was the S point

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Z of course because he is the complex variable interns in which were

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
representing the sea transport

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
so we will be representing

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the z transform interns of

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
representations in the complex plane

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
real part an imaginary part

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but I've also identified a circle here

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and you could wonder well what's the significance

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
the circle recall

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
dead in the discussion that we just came from

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
when we talked about the relationship between is a transforming the 48

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
transform

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
busy transform reduces to the Fourier transform

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
when the magnitude of Z's equal to 1

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the magnitude is equal to 1 in the complex plane is a circle

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and that circle in fact is a circle love radius

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
1 and so its on this contour

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
in the seaplane that busy transform

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
reduces to the 48 transform and we'll see some additional significance to that

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
as we go along just again emphasize the relationship since

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and differences with continuous-time with the a-plus transform is the

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
behavior in the ass playing on the J Omega axis

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
dead corresponds to

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the Fourier transform here its the behavior on the unit circle

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
with busy transform corresponds to the Fourier transform

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
now we'll be talking as we did with a plus transform

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
we'll be talking very often about

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
transforms which are rational at and rational transfers as we kiss

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
was we'll see represent systems

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
which are characterized by linear cut the coefficient difference equations

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and so 4

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the rational transfer for the rational see transforms

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
will again find it convenient to use a representation

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
interns opposes zeros and dizzy play so let's

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
in look at are example as we worked it out

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
previously example ten-point 1 and

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
with this sequence

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
busy transformers one divided by one minus AZ the -1

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and we happen to have written it as a function of Z to the -1

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
clearly we can rewrite this by multiplying

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
numerator and denominator by Z and this would equivalent leave NBC divided by

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
see minus a

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and so if we were to represent this

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
through a poll 0 plot we would have 0 at the arch in corresponding this factor

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and a poll at Z equals a

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
corresponding to the denominator factor and

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
so the poll 0 pattern for this

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is then a poll it's equal to a

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and 0 at the origin

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
now let me just comment quickly about the fact that we wrote

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that we've written this as one over one minus AZ the -1

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and it seems kinda strange because perhaps we should have multiplied

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
through by C

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
%uh let me just indicate dead

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
as you'll see as you work examples it's very typical for busy transform

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
to come out as a function %uh Zeta -1

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and so very typically you'll get to recognize

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
dead things will be expressed in terms of factors involving

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
terms like one minus AZ the -1 rather than

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
factors are the foreign C-minus a alright well

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
here is the one example that we heard referred to

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and if we consider another example

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
the other example which was example 10.22

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
consists love

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a an algebraic expression as i indicate here

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
but its region %uh validity is the magnitude is the less than the magnitude

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
have a

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and that corresponds to the same poll 0

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
apply but a region of convergence

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which is inside this circle

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
whereas in the previous case

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
with the poll 0 plot we had a region of convergence

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
which was for the magnitude at sea greater than the magnitude have a

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
so these two examples this one and the other one

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
have exactly the same poll 0 pattern and their distinguished by

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
their regional convergence now

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
notice incidently that in this particular case

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the region of convergence includes the unit circle provided that

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the magnitude have a is less than one and so in fact

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that would say dead the sequence

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
has 48 transform that converges namely with the magnitude see

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
equal to 1 whereas in this example

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the regional convergence does not include the unit circle

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and so in fact we cannot look at Exit see for the magnitude is equal to 1

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and so this example with the magnitude have a less than 1

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
does not have a Fourier transform the convergence

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
well assuming that the bank to give a is less than one

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and the Fourier transform converges we can in fact

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
look at the Fourier transform by

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
observing what happens as we go around the unit circle

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
we've seen as for the a-plus transform interns observing what happened as we

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
move along the jail make axis

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and here again we can use

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
the vectors

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
as we trace out the unit circle

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and in particular what we would be looking at in this case

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
is the ratio of the zero vector

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
to the polls actor for example if we were looking at the magnitude busy

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
transform

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the magnitude is a transform with the the ratio the like that this factor

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
to the like that this specter

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and to observe the Fourier transform we would observe

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
how those vectors change in length

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
as we move around the unit circle

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and as we move around the unit circle what we were trace out

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
interns the ratio the lights are those vectors is

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the for EA transform

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
okay well let's focus

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
on that also in the context

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
love a slightly different the transforming dizzy transform here

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
as we'll see in later lecture is this the transform associated with the

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
second-order

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
difference equation it's a it has a denominator factor which has

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
which has two poles associated with it

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and so here if we assumed

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that the forty a transformer The Associated sequence

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
converge then again we would look

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
at the behavior this as we moved around the unit circle

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and the ratio the links at the appropriate vectors

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
would describe 4s the frequency response

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm sorry the Fourier transform so

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
the Fourier transform magnitude would consist the

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the ratio the lengths

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
above the zero vectors divided by the links to the poll vectors

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and one thing that we observe is dead

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
as we move in frequency Omega in the vicinity

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
love this poll this poll fact there in fact

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
reaches a minimum length that would mean

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
there'd its reciprocal would be maximum

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and then as we sweep past the lysate these two vectors would increase the

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
zero vector is a course

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
would retain the same way no matter where we were

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
on the unit circle so in fact if we look at the Fourier transform associated with

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
this poll 0 pattern

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
if this was for example the the

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
for EA the represented the the

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
see transform or the impulse response

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the linear time-invariant system the corresponding frequency response

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
would be what I plotted out below and so

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
it would peak and in fact where it would peak

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is in the vicinity above the frequency location of the poll

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
as I indicate up here

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
so as we sweep past is this poll

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
then in fact this 48 transform

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
peaks well

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
this notion love looking at the frequency response as we move around the

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
unit circle

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
is a very important notion and it's important to recognize that is the unit

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
circle that we're talking about here whereas before

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
we were talking about the jail major axis

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and to emphasize this further

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
let me just show this example and in fact

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the previous example with the

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
computer display so that we can see the frequency response

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
as it sweeps out as we go around the unit circle

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
so here we have the poll 0 pattern

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
for the second-order example and to generate the Fourier transform

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we want to look at the behavior of the polling 0 vectors as we move around the

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
unit circle

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
so first let's display the vectors

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and here we have them displayed to

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the point corresponding to zero frequency

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and the magnitude of the Fourier transform

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
will be as we discussed the magnet to the like that this 0 factors divided by

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the magnitude of the like that the poll vectors

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
shown below will be the for EA transform

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and we have the Fourier transform displayed

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
hear from 0 to 2pi rather than

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
from mine despite supply as it was displayed in the transparency

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
because the periodicity the Fourier transform

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
both those are acquittal

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
now we're sweeping away from I'll make equal 0

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and the lengths on the pole vectors have changed

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and that of course generates a change in

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the 48 transform and

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
as we continue the process further

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
if we increase frequency

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
as we sweep closer to the location at the pole

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the polls actor decreases in length dramatically

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and net generates a residence in the 48 transform

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
very similar to what we saw in continuous-time

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
now as we continue to sweep

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
further what will happen is that

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
that poll factor will begin to increase in like that again

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and so in fact the magnitude of the Fourier transform

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
will decrease and we see that here

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
as we sweep toward or making equal to pie

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
now notice in this process that the

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
like that the zero vector is has stayed the same

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
because the fact that this 0 the zeros

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
are at the origin and no matter where we are in the unit circle the like that

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
those factors is unity

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
so they don't influence in this example the magnitude but they would of course

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
influence the face

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
now we want to continue sweeping from make people to pie

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
around to 2pi and because the symmetry in the Fourier transform

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
what we will see in the magnitude is identical to what we would see

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
if we swept from a geek with the pie back

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
clockwise who are making equal 0

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
in particular now as we're increasing frequency

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
notice that the link love the poll

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
vector associated with the lower half plane poll is decreasing

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and so in fact that corresponds to

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to generating a residence as

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we sweep past that polo cation as we are here

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and then finally that poll factor increases in Lang

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
as we begin to approach will make people to 2pi

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
or equivalent Lee as we approach Omega equal to 0

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
no finally let's also look at

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the for EA transform associated with

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the first order example that we discussed earlier in the lecture

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and so what we wanted look at is the four EA transform as the poll

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
n0 vectors change once again

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the Fourier transform will be displayed on a scale from 0 to 2pi

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
frequency scale from 0 to 2pi rather than mine despite a pie

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and we want to observe the poll n0 vectors as we sweep around the unit

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
circle

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
we display first the poll n0 vectors

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
at Omega equal to 0 and

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
as the frequency increases

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the polls vector increases in length

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
zero vector since the zeros at the origin

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
will have constantly no matter where we are on the unit circle although it would

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
affect the phase which we are not displaying here

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and so the principal affect the only affect really in the magnitude

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
is due to the poll vector as the frequency

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
continues to increase the poll vector

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
increases in length monotonically

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
in fact and so that means that the magnitude

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
above the 48 transform will decrease monotonically

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
until we get past Omega equal to pie

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
here we are now at Omega equal to pie

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and when we continue sweeping past

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
this frequency around to 2pi then

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
we will see basically the same curve swept out

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
in reverse sense because the symmetry

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
again if the 48 transform magnitude sweeping from

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
hi tu Pai is going to be equivalent

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
with regard to the magnitude too sweeping from pie

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
back to zero and so now

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the poll vector begins to decrease in length and

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
correspondingly the magnitude of the Fourier transform

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
will increase and

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that will continue until we get around to make people to 2pi

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
which is equivalent of course will make people 0

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and obviously if we continue to sweep around again we would simply

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
trace out other periods associated with

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
the forty a transport

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
well that hopefully gives you care some feel for

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
for the notion I love %uh sweeping around the unit circle and of course you

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
can see that

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
dead because the circle is periodic

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
as we go around and around of course what would get is a periodic for EA

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
transform which is

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the way for EA transforms are supposed to be now

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the just is

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
with the Laplace transform the

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
region of convergence that the transform

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
as we've seen in this example and

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
is a very important part the specification

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
above busy transform and we can

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
in talking about sequences near transforms either

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
specify the regional convergence implicitly or we can't specify

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
explicitly

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
we can for example say what it is says

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
let's say the magnitude easy being greater than the magnitude a

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
or we can recognize that the region of convergence

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
has certain constraints associated with

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
certain properties love the time function and

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
in particular there are

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
some important properties love the region of convergence

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
which allow us given

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
bed we know certain characteristics at the time function

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
to then identify the region of convergence

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
by looking at the poll 0 pad for example

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
we recognize that the region of convergence

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
does not contain any polls because the fact that at polls

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
busy transform in fact blows up

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and of course can converge at that point furthermore

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
the region of convergence consists love a ring

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
in the seaplane centered about the origin

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
recall there with a plus transform

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the regional convergence consisted of strips in

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the S plane with the sea transform the region of convergence consist suffering

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
basically because if the fact that the regional convergence

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
is dependent on the magnitude of Z whereas

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
with a plus transform the region of convergence was dependent on the real

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
party vez

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the fact that is the magnitude of the says

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
in effect dead all values see that have the same magnitude

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
lie on a circle and so the regional convergence you would expect

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to be a concentric ring

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in the seaplane furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
actually convergence %uh the Fourier transform

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
includes the unit circle in the play now

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
in we can also associate the region of convergence with issues

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
about whether the sequence is a finite duration

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
alright cited or left-sided in and

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
let's let me sir quickly indicate again

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
what this I love the argument is if

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
we have a finite duration sequence so that

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
the sequence is absolutely solvable and therefore has a Fourier transform that

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
converges

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
then because of the fact dead it 0 outside some interval

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I can multiply it by an exponentially

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
decaying sequence or by an exponentially growing sequence

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and since I'm only doing is over a finite interval

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
no matter how I choose that exponential will end up

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
with an absolutely some herbal product so

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
if accident is a finite duration that in fact the region of convergence

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
is the entire seaplane possibly

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
with the exception of the origin or insanity on the other hand

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
if the sequence is a right-sided sequence

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
then we have to be careful that we don't

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
multiply by an exponential that grows too fast

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
for positive time or equivalent Lee in

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
we have to might have to choose the exponential so that

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it DK sufficiently fast for positive time

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
as a consequence if that for a right-sided sequence

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
if we have a value which is in the region of convergence

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
as long as I multiply by exponentials

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that DK faster than that for positive time

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
then also have

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
convergence in other words all finite values Z

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to which the magnitude it sees greater than this so that the exponentials die

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
of even faster

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
will also be in the region of convergence

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
if we combine that statement with the fact that there are no polls

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
in the region of convergence then we end up with a statement similar to what we

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
had with the applause transform

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
here the statement is dead if the sequences right-sided

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
then the regional convergence

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
has to be outside the outermost poll essentially because it has to be outside

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
someplace and can include any polls

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
finally if we have

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
a left-sided sequence

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
van the if we have a value which is in the region convergence

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
all values for which the magnitude see is less than that

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
will also be in the region of convergence or if ecstasy is rational

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
then the region of convergence must be inside the innermost poll

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and finally if we have a two-sided sequence

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
then this kind of a balance between

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the exponential factor that we use and so in that case

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
then the region of convergence will be ring

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
in the seaplane and a essentially will extend outward to a poll

00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
an inward to a poll so if we had

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
an algebraic expression let's say as

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
in we have here

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
in then

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
we can associate with that a region of convergence outside this poll

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and that would correspond to a right-sided sequence

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
or we can associate it with it a region of convergence

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
which is inside

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the innermost poll and that would correspond to a left-sided sequence

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and the third and only other possibility

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
is a region of convergence which

00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
lies between these two poles and

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
that would then correspond to a two-sided sequence

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
noticed incidentally because that way right place these polls

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that this is the only one for which the regional convergence includes the unit

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
circle

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
in other words it's the only one for which the Fourier transform convergence

00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
okay now we move through that fairly quickly and

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
a I've emphasize the fact that it parallels very closely what we did

00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
with the a-plus transform what I'd like to do

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is just conclude with a discussion of

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
how we get the time function back again

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
when we have busy transform including its regional convergence

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
well we can first the ball develop a more less formal expression

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and the algebra for this is going through in the text and you went through

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
something similar

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
to this with the applause transform in the video course manual so I won't carry

00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
through the details

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
but basically well we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact

00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
that dizzy transform is the Fourier transform

00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
the sequence exponentially weighted so we can apply the inverse

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
transformed to that and

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
that gives is not active and protective an exponentially weighted

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
and if we track that through then what we'll end up with

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
is an expression after we've taken care of

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
few the app's lines and deltas will end up with an expression

00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
that expresses formally

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the sequence XFN interns

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
love busy transform where

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
this in fact is a cock to her in a goal in the complex plane

00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and so there's a formal expression just

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
as there's a formal expression for the apostrophe its form

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but in fact the more typical procedure is

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
to use essentially transform pairs that we know

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
together with the idea of using a partial fraction expansion

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
so if we had a sequence if we had a see transformers I indicate here

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and if we expanded out

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
in a partial fraction expansion

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
then weekend recognize as

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
we did in a similar style with the lip gloss transform

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
we can recognize dead each term

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
together with the identified region of convergence

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
corresponds to an exponential factor

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
and so this term together with the fact that we know that the magnitude of C

00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
must be greater than to allows us

00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
to recognize this as similar to

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the example ten-point 1 and in particular than

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
the sequence associated with that is what I indicate here

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and for the second term the sequence is

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
what I indicate here so

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
what we're simply doing is using the fact that

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
we've worked out big the example going one direction before

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and now we use that together with the partial fraction expansion

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to get the individual sequences back again

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and then at them together is one other method which I'll just point to

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
which eg is also elaborated on a little more in the text

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
but it's kind of the idea I love developing the inverse

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Z transformed by recognizing dead

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
this the transformer formula

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
in fact is a power series

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
so if we take exigency

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and expanded into power series

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
then we can pick of the values affect the van

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
by identifying the individual coefficients

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
in this expansion

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
okay and so by simply doing long division for example

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
we can also get the inverse transform

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and that by the way is very useful particularly

00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
if we want to get the inverse see transform

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
for z transform expression which is not rational

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
right now we move through this fairly quickly on the other hand I stress

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
dead it's very similar to what we went through for the applause transform

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
except

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
for a very important difference

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
the principal difference really being that with a plus transform it was the J

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Omega axis and the S plane

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
that we focused attention on when we're thinking about the Fourier transform

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
here the unit circle in the seaplane plays an important role

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
well we'll see when we continue this in the next lecture is dead

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
there are properties are busy transform

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
just as they were properties of us transform

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and those properties allow us

00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
to develop and exploit

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
busy transform in the context love

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
systems describable by when your constant coefficient difference

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
equations

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
so in the next lecture will focus on

00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
some properties busy transform and then we'll see

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
how to use those properties to help us

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
in getting further insight and working with system

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
describe a wall by difference equations thank you
