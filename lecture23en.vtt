the in

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the new the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
last time we began the discussion

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
love z transform and

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
as with the La Paz transforming continuous time we developed it

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
as a generalization of the Fourier transform the

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
expression that we got to dizzy transform is

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the some that I indicate here and

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we also briefly talked about and in Bercy transform

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
integral and some other informal methods

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
love computing the inverse eat transform but

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
we focused in particular on the relationship between busy transform

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the Fourier transform pointing out

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
first the ball dead busy transform

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
when we choose the magnitude is the

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
equal to 1 so the magnitude is the the for

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you to the jail maker just simply reduces

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to the 4e a transformer the sequence

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
then in addition we

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
explored busy transform foresee more general complex number

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and in a discrete-time z transform case

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we expressed that complex number in polar form

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
as our you DJ Omega and

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
recognized dead busy transform expression

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
in fact corresponds to the four EA transform

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
love the sequence exponentially weighted and

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
because I love the exponential weighting the

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
see transform converges for some

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
values of our corresponding to some exponential weighting

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and perhaps not for others and that

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
led to a notion which corresponded to

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the regional convergence associated with dizzy transform

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and we talked some about properties in the region of convergence

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
particularly in relation to the poll 0

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
banner now the sea transform has

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
a number all important and useful properties just as the apostrophe s form

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
does

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and as one part of this lecture what will want to do in fact

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is exploit some of these properties in the context of systems described by with

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
your constant coefficient difference equations

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the spur ticular properties said

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
play an important role in that context so the properties that I indicate year

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and in particular their is as

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
with continuous time a linearity property that tells us

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
dead the busy transform a linear combination of sequences

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
in fact is the same linear combination of busy transforms

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
a shifting property that

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
indicates dead dizzy transform

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Aug exit then shifted is busy transform

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
all exit then multiplied by a factor Z the -10 0

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and then the convolution property

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
for which the z transform

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
all a convolution sequences is

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the product all the associated see transforms

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and with all of these properties

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of course there is again the issue love what the Associated region of

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
convergence is

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
in comparison with the regional convergence the original sequences

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and that is an issue this address

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
somewhat more in the text and let's not going to adhere

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
with the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
convolution property the

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
convolution property as in continuous-time

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
course provides a mechanism for dealing

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
with linear time-invariant systems in particular

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in the time domain a linear time-invariant system

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
is described through convolution namely

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the output is the convolution love the input

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and the impulse response because of the

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
convolution property associated with busy transform

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
z transform up the output is busy transformer the input

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
times the sea transform up the impulse response

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and again very much the same as

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
what we had in continuous-time and also what we had

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
in the context that the discussion with the Fourier transform

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
in fact because if the relationship between busy transform the 48 transform

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
busy transform all the impulse response

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude is equal to 1

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
more generally when we talk about this the transform

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
are the impulse response we will refer to it as

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the system function associated with the system

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
now the convolution property in these other properties as i indicated

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we will find useful in talking about systems which are described

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
by linear constant coefficient difference equations and in fact

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
will do that shortly but first what I'd like to do

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is to continue

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to focus on the system function

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for linear time-invariant systems and make a couple comments

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that tie back to some things that we said in the last lecture

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
relating to the relationship between

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the region of convergence a system or

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll I'm sorry the regional convergence a busy transform

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and the issue of how that

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
where that is in relation to the holes a busy transport

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
now in particular we can draw some conclusions

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
flying back to that discussion about the

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
polo cations 0 the system function

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in relation to weathered the system is

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
stable and whether the system is causal

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in particular recall from one of the early lectures way back when

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
dead stability for a system

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
corresponded to the statement that the impulse response

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
is absolutely some local furthermore

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
when we talked about the Fourier transform

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the Fourier transform all a sequence

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
converges if the sequence is absolutely some mobile

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
so in fact the condition for stability

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and others I'll a system and the conditions for convergence in the

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Fourier transform ovitz impulse response

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
in fact are the same condition namely

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
absolute some ability now

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
what does this mean what it means is dead

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
if the Fourier transform converges

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that means that the z transform converges on the unit circle

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
consequently if the system is stable

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
then the system function z transform the impulse response

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Moss also converge on the unit circle

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
in other words the impulse response must have a 48 transform

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that converges soul for stable system

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
then the region of convergence the system function

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
must include the unit circle in the seaplane

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
so we see how stability relates

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to the location all

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the region of convergence and we can also relate causality

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to the region of convergence in particular we know

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
dead if system is causal

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
than the impulse response is right sided

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
for sequences right-sided the regional convergence

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
love it see transform must be outside the outermost poll

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so for causality the regional convergence services to function must be

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
outside the outermost poll

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
for stability the regional convergence must include the unit circle

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and in fact we can also then draw from at the conclusion

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
dead if we have a system its causal unstable

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
than all polls must be inside the unit circle

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because of the fact that the polls must because the fact that the region of

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
convergence must be

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
outside the outermost poll and has to also include the unit circle

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
soul for example if we had

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
let's say system with a system function

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
as I indicate here

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
with the algebraic expression for the system function

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
being the expression that I indicate here with a pole at sequels a third

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and another poll as equals to an 8-0 at the origin

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
if in fact the system

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
was causal corresponding to an impulse response that's right sided

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this then would be the region of convergence

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the system function alternatively

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
if I knew that the system was stable then I know that

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the region of convergence must include the unit circle and so

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
this would be then the region of convergence

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and what you might now want to ask yourselves

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is if instead the region of convergence

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for the system function is this there and

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
is the system causal first question

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
second question is is the system stable

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
remembering that for causality the regional convergence must be outside the

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
outermost poll

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and for stability must include the unit circle

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
all right now what I'd like to do is

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
look at the properties

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
love the z transform

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and in particular exploit these properties in the context systems

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and the three basic properties that play a key role in that discussion

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
are the linearity property

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
shifting property and the convolution property

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and and so the stand are the properties

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
dead I want to exploit so

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
let's do that by first looking at a

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
first-order difference equation and in the case

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
love a first-order difference equation which

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've written as i indicate year no turns on the right hand side but we could have

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
terms of course in general

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
so why am i sayi van -1 equals x seven

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and we can use the linearity property

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
so that if we take this the transformer both sides have this expression

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that will then be busy transformer this term plus the transformer this term

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and so using those properties

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and together with the shifting property

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the property that tells us that the Z transform I'll

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
y ven -1 is see to the -1 times the transformer y ven

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and we can solve this outbreak expression for

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
busy transform up the output in terms of

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
busy transformer the input

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
now what we know from the convolution property

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
is that for system the the chance for the output is the system function times

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the transformer the input

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
so this factor that we have then

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
must correspond to the

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
system function or equivalent Lee

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
busy transform of the impulse response the system

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and in fact then if we have this the transform we could figure out

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
what the impulse response that the system is

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
by computing or determining what the inverse the transformants

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
except for the fact that that expression

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is an algebraic expression and

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
doesn't yet totally specified dizzy transform because we don't yet know what

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the region of convergence is

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
how do we get the regional convergence well we have the same issue here as we

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
have with the apostrophe in swarm

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
namely the point dead difference equation

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that is specified by either explicitly

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
because it's one way or another we know with the impulse responses

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
or implicitly because we know certain properties in the system

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
such as causality and/or stability

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
so if on a

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
let's say a imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the condition all causality

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
then what that requires is dead the impulse

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
response the right-sided or

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the region of convergence be outside the outermost poll

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and so for this example that would require then

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that the region of convergence correspond to

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the magnitude is Z greater than the magnitude a

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
what you might think about is whether I would get the same condition

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
if I required instead that the system

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
be stable and furthermore you could think about the question of whether I

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
could

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
specify or impose on this system that if the boat stable in causal

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the real issue let me just kind of point to it is dead

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the answer to those questions relate to

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
whether the magnitude a vase less than 1 with a magnitude is greater than one

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if the magnitude have a is less than one and I specify causality

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that will also mean

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that the system is stable in any case

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
given this region of convergence then the

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
impulse response is the inverse transformer that see transform which is

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
a to the end times you there

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
right now let's look at second order equation is a very similar strategy

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
for the second-order equation the one that I picked is

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
love this particular form and I've written

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the coefficients parametrically as i indicate here for a specific reason

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
which will see shortly again I can apply this the transform

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to this expression and I've skipped

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
an algebraic stepper to hear when I do this then

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
again you I use the when you're ready property and a shifting property

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and I end up with this algebraic expression

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
if I now solve that to express why if the

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in terms of exits the and a function of Z

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
then this is what I get for the system function

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and in so this is now

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
a second-order system function and will have 20 that the origin

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and it will have two poles

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
again and there's the question 0

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
what we assume about the regional convergence I haven't specified date yet

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
but if we let's say assume that

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the reach dead the system is causal which I will tend to do

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
then that means that the region of convergence is outside the outermost

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
poll

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
now where the polls well let me just kinda vindicate

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
dad if and you can verify this algebraically

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I actually Jer dead

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
if the cosine beta term

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
is less than 1

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
then the roots of this polynomial

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
will be complex and in fact the polls

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
are at are eat a plus or minus J theta

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
soul for Cosi pay to less than 1% then

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the polls are complex and

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
the complex polls at an angle theta and

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
with a distance from the origin equal to the parameter are

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
so in fact let's just look at that

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and what I show here is the

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
poll 0 pattern

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
assuming that are is less than one

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and that cosine data is less than one

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and we have a complex poll pair shown here

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and now if we we assume that the system was causal

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
that means that the region of convergence is outside these polls

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and that would then include the unit circle

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
which means that the system is also stable

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and in fact as long as the region of convergence includes the unit circle

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
we can also talk about the

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
frequency response of the system namely we can evaluate the system function

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
on the unit circle and we in fact evaluated

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the forty a transform associated with this

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
polls 0 pattern last time and recalled that

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
the frequency response then is one that has

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a resident character with the resonant peak

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
being roughly in the the sanity love

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the angle of the Polo cation

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and as the parameter are very slight Cesar get smaller

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
this peak 10's to broaden as our

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
gets closer to one the residence tends to get sharp

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
alright well this is now

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
can a job look at busy transform and we see very strong parallels to the

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
low-cost rents form

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
in fact throughout the course

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I tried to emphasize and it just naturally happens

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that there are very strong relationships

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and parallels between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and in fact at one point we

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
specifically map from continuous I discrete time when we talked about

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and what I'd like to do now is turn our attention

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to another very important reason

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
for mapping from continuous-time to discrete-time

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and in the process of doing this what will need to do is exploit

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
fairly heavily the insight into wishin

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and procedures that we've developed for

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the La Paz transform and easy transport

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
specifically what I would like to begin is a discussion

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
relating to mapping continuous-time

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
filters to discrete-time filters

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
or continuous-time system functions to

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
discrete-time system functions now

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
why would we want to do that well their

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
are at least several reasons for wanting to Mac continuous-time

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
filters to discrete-time filters one of course is the fact that

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
in some situations what we're interested in

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
doing is processing continuous-time signals

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
with discrete-time systems or

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
said another way simulate continuous-time

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
systems with discrete-time systems

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and so would be natural in a setting like that to think a mapping the

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the desired continuous I filter to a discrete-time

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
told so that's one very important context

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
is another very important context in which

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
this is done and then is in the con- it

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
or in the in the context or

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
for the purpose all exploiting

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
establish design procedures for continuous five filters

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
the point is the following: we may or may not

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
be processing it a sample continuous-time signal with our

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
discrete-time salter maybe just be discrete-time signals that we're working

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
with

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but in that situation

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
still we need to design the appropriate discreet I filter

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
historically their is a very

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
rich history

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
associated with design a continuous-time filters

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and in many cases it's possible

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and very worthwhile and efficient to

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
take those designs and map dome

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
to discrete-time designs to use them as discrete time filters

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
so another very important reason for talking about the kinds mappings there

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
we will be going into

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is this simply take advantage I love what has been done historically

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in the continuous-time case

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
all right now if we want to map

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
continuous I filters to discrete-time filters

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
then in continuous-time we're talking about a system function

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and an associated differential equation

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and indiscreet I'm there is the corresponding

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
system function and the corresponding

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
difference equation and

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
basically what we want to do is generate

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
from a continuous-time system

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in some way a discrete-time system that

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
meets in dissociated set ok desired specifications

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
now there's certain constraints that its

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
reasonable an important to impose on

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
whatever kinds mappings we use

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
obviously wanna mapping that will take are continuous-time system function

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and map it to a discrete-time system function correspondingly in the time

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
domain

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
their is a continuous-time impulse response

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that maps to the Associated discrete-time impulse response

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
these are more less natural the two that are important and

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
sometimes easy to lose sight of are the two that I indicate here

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in particular if we r mapping

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
a continuous-time filter with let's say a desire desirable

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
frequency response to a discrete-time

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
filter and we would like to preserve the good qualities that frequency response

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
as we look at the discrete-time frequency response

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
then it's important that

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
what happens in the ass plane for the continues type filter along the jail

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
make axis

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
relate in a nice way to what happens

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
in the seaplane around the unit circle

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
because it's this over here

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that represents the frequency response in continuous-time

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and this contour over here that represents the frequency response

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in discrete-time so that's an important property we want

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
have the J Omega axis to map

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to the unit circle another

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
more less natural condition to impose

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
is a condition that if we

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
are assured in some way that our continuous type filter is stable

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
then we would like to concentrate on design procedures that

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
more or less preserved at and will give us stable digital filters

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
so these are are reasonable conditions to impose on the procedure

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and what I'd like to do in the remainder this lecture is look at

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to common procedures for mapping continuous-time filters to discrete-time

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
filters the first one that I

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
want to talk about is one that in fact is very frequently use

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and also one

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
that as we'll see for a variety of reasons is

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
highly undesirable the second

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is one that is also frequently used and as we'll see

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
is arm in certain situations very desirable

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the first one i wanna talk about is

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the more less intuitive simple

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
procedure 0 mapping a difference equation at

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
differential equation to a difference equation by

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
simply replacing derivatives by

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
differences and kinda the idea is that it

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
a derivative is more or less a difference and there's some dummy

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
parameter capital T that I've thrown in here which

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I won't focus too much on but in any case

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
this seems to have some plausibility if we take the differential equation and do

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
this with all the derivatives

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
on both in terms of wife tnx ft

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
what we'll end up with is a difference equation

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
now what we can use are the properties

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
love the boss transforming dizzy transform

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to see what this means in terms of a mapping a particular

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
using a different ciation property from a plus transforms

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
in the a-plus transform domain we would have this

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
using the properties for

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
busy transform busy transformer this expression would be this

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and so in effect what it says

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
is dead every place in the system function

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
or the differential equation that we would be multiplying by S

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
when we'll pass transformed in the difference equation we would be

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
multiplying by this factor

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
so in fact what this means is that

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the mapping from continuous time to discrete-time

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
corresponds to taking the system function

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and replacing s wherever we see it

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
by one minus the to the -1 over capital T

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and so if we have a system function in continuous-time

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and we map it to a discrete-time system function

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
this way by replacing derivatives by differences

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
then that corresponds to replacing asked by

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
$1 -2 -1 over capital T

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
now we'll see shortly what this mapping

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
actually means more specifically in relating yes plane to the seaplane

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
let me just quickly because I want to refer to this

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
also point to another procedure very much like backward differences

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
which corresponds to replacing derivatives not by the backward

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
difference is that I just showed

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but by former differences and in that case

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
then the mapping corresponds replacing asked by

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Zeta minus one over capital T

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
looks very similar to the previous case and

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
so there the relationship between the system functions

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
is what I indicate here

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
alright well let's just take a look at

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
what that those mappings correspond to when we look at this specifically

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
in the S plane and in the seaplane brown

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
what I show here is the s plane

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and chorus its things in the left after the S plane posing left after the s plan

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that would guarantee stability

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
its the chair make axis that tells us about the frequency response

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and in the seaplane its

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the unit circle that tells us about the frequency response

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and things inside the unit circle or poles inside the unit circle to

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
guarantee stability

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
now the mapping from yes point to the sea plane corresponding

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
to replacing derivatives by backward differences

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
in fact can be shown to correspond

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to mapping DJ Omega axis

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
not to the unit circle but

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to the little circle that I show here which is inside the unit circle

00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the left half oath the S plane maps to the insider that circle

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
what does that mean that means they had if we have

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
a really good frequency response

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
characteristic along this contour

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
in the S plane will see that same frequency response

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
along this little circle that's not the one we want though

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we would like to see that same frequency response around the unit circle

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
to emphasize this point even more suppose for example

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
that we had appear polls

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in our continuous-time system function that look like this

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
then where they're likely to end up

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in busy plane is

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
inside the unit circle of course by if

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
the polls here are close to the jail make axis

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that means that these polls will be close to this circle

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
but in fact might be very far away from the unit circle

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
so what would happen then is dead

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
if we saw in the continuous-time filter very sharp residence

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the discrete-time filter in fact might very well have that residents broadened

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
considerably

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
because the polls is so far away from the unit circle

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
now 1 plus

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
with this method and it's about the only one

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
is the fact that the left after the S plane

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
maps inside the unit circle in fact inside the circle inside the unit circle

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and so stability is always guarantee

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
let me just quickly mention and you'll have a chance to look at this a little

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
more carefully in the

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
video course manual dead for

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
forward difference is that a backward differences

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
this contour and yes plane

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
maps to a line in the seaplane

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
which is online tangent to the unit circle

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and in fact is the line that I show their

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so not only are for differences

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
equally bad and turns at the issue whether they mapped from the chair may

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
get access to the unit circle

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
but they have further difficulty associated with them

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
which is the difficulty dead

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
they may not and generally don't guarantee stability

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
right now that's one method and

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'll one as i indicated that so often use partly

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I am a because it seems so intuitively plausible

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and what you can see is that by understand it carefully the issues and

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the techniques of apostasy transforms

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you can begin to see what some of the difficulties with that method

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
for those methods are the next method

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
dad I'd like to talk about is a method that in fact is very

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
commonly used and it's a very important useful method

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
which Chynoweth can be motivated by thinking along the lines of both

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
mapping the continuous-time filter to

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
a discrete-time sold their in such a way

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
dead the shape up the impulse response is preserved

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and in fact more specifically so that

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
the discrete-time impulse response corresponds to

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
samples love the continuous-time impulse response

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and this is a method that's referred to as

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
in polls invariance

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
so what imposing variance corresponds to

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
is designing the filter in such a way

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that the discrete-time filter

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
impulse response is simply

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
sample version love the continuous type filter impulse response

00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
with a sampling period which I do know here's capital T

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and that will turn into a slightly confusing parameter

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
shortly and perhaps carried over into the next lecture

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and hopefully we'll get that straightened out though

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
within those two lectures now remembering

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the issues of sampling the discrete-time

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
frequency response then since the frequency response is the forty a

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
transformer the impulse response

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
is related to the continuous-time impulse responses I indicate here

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and what this says is that it is

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
the superposition

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
all replications love the continuous high frequency response

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
linearly scaled in frequency and

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
shifted and added to each other it's the same old

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
are so shifting ending a really is saying issued the same sampling issues

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that we've addressed before

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
well this equation will help us understand what the frequency response

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
looks like

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
but in terms of an analytical procedure

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
for mapping the continuous-time system function

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
to a discrete-time system function we can see

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
dat and develop it in the following way:

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
let's consider the continuous-time system function

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
expanded in a partial fraction expansion

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and just for convenience on picking first-order polls this can be

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
general generalized or rather single polls this can be generalized

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
to on multiple order polls

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and we won't do that here the same basic strategy applies

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and we look at the impulse response associated with this

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
we know how to take the inverse Laplace transform with this

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
where I'm just naturally assume because our the throughout the discussion

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the continuous-time impulse response then is

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
someone exponentials with these amplitudes

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and at these complex exponential frequencies

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
now impulse in various corresponds to sampling this

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and so the discrete-time impulse response

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
is simply a sample version of this and

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
in the AC cave course carries down

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and we have the exponential were sampling at Eagles and capital T and so

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
we've replaced that here and then the unit step

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to truncate things for negative time

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
right well let's manipulate this further and

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
eventually what we want to get is relationship mapping

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
from the continuous-time to the discrete-time filter

00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
so we had this staff that we can rewrite that

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
now as I show here just

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
simply taking this and outside we have EDS

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
k capital T so now this is %uh the for

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the summer terms like a suitcase me

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
times fated to the N we can compute is a transformer this

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and busy transform the week at I show

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
here it's simply a sieve K over one minus

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
in the s2k capital T see the -1

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
simply carrying this term or this

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
this parameter down

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so we started with a continuous-time system function which was the sole turns

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
like a sieve K over s minus SFK the polls were tested K

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
we now have the day that discrete I filter in this form

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and consequently then this procedure in Polson variance

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
corresponds to

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
mapping the continuous I filter to discrete-time filter

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
by mapping the polls in the continuous I filter

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
according to this mapping

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
the continuous part filter poll and SFK gets map topo edited the s2k capital T

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and the coefficients a suitcase

00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
a are preserve

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and that an algebraically is what the procedure of impulse and variance

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
corresponds to

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
okay well let's look at

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
how we interpret summer this in the frequency domain

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and in particular

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
we have the expression that tells us how the

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
discrete-time frequency response

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
is related to the continuous-time frequency response

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
this is the expression that we had previously

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
when we have talked about issues of sampling

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
so that means that we would form the discrete I frequency response

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
by taking the continuous-time one scaling it

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
in frequency according to this parameter capital T

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and then Anne replications that together

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
so if this is the continuous-time

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
frequency response just simply an idea low-pass filter with the cutoff

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
frequency of omega-6

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
see van the its

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
frequency scaling operation would keep the same basic shape

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but but linearly scale the frequency axis so that we now have Omega sexy

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
times capital T

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and then the discrete-time frequency response

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
would be a superposition at these and it together

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
at multiples of 2 pie indiscreet time-frequency

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and so that's what we have here

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
so this is the discreet I frequency response

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so this looks very nice it looks like in Polson variance will

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
take the continuous I frequency response just simply

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
linearly scale the frequency axis and incidently periodically repeated

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
we know that for an idea low-pass filter that looks just fine and in fact

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
for a ban limited frequency response that looks just fine

00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
but we know also that anytime that were sampling

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
here with sampling the impulse response we have

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
in effect in the frequency domain where the potential for a second effect

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
dead we refer to as alias so in fact

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
if instead of the ideal low-pass filter

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
we had taken a filter that was an approximation to a low pass filter

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
then the corresponding frequency scale version

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
would look as I've shown here and now as we add these together

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
then what we will have is some potential

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for distortion corresponding to the fact that

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
these replications overlap and

00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
what that will lead to is aliasing

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
so some things that we can say about imposing variance

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
is there yet we have an algebraic procedure at all

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
illustrate with another example shortly for taking a continuous I've system

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
function mapping it to a discrete-time

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
system function it has a very nice property in terms of both

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
a %uh mapping the mapping from

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
the frequency axis in continuous-time the to the

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
unit circle namely

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to a first approximation as long as there's no aliasing

00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the mapping is just simply a linear scaling the frequency axis although

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
there may be some alias saying that means of course that this method can

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
only be used

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
if the frequency response that's being mapped work the system is being mad

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
has a frequency response that's approximately low-pass had asked to be

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
approximately ban limit

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and then what we have is some

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
pop potential distortion which comes about because bailey's

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
also because if the mapping the fact that polls at soka

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
get map to polls at you to the s2k capital T

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
if the analog a continuous-time filter is

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
stable meaning that the real party Vesta case is negative

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
then the discrete types author is guaranteed to be stable

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
in other words the magnitude as the suitcase a

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
will be guaranteed to be less than 1 I'm assuming of course that discussion

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
we're are always imposing causality and systems

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Bardwell to just look at the algebraic mapping

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
a little more carefully let's take a simple example

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
here is an example all

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
a system a continuous-time system where

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I simply have a resident poll pair

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
with a real with an imaginary part along the

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Majuri accessible make it so far a real part of mine a South

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
for and so The Associated system function and

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
is just the expression which incorporates

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the two poles and I put in a scale factor to Omega so far

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and now to design the discrete-time

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
filter using in Polson variance you carry out a partial fraction expansion

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
of this

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and that partial fraction expansion is shown below

00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
we have a pole at minus South a-minus J Omega are and at minus alpha plus Chi

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Omega are

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and to determine the

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
discrete-time filter based on imposing variance

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
we would map the polls and preserves the coefficients a Sat K

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
referred to as the residues and so the

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
discrete-time filter that we would end up with

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
as system function which I indicate

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
here and we have is a

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
said preserve the residue and

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the poll is now at either minus out the TE

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you the vice chair makes a party that's one term

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and the other term in Assam has a pole at the complex conjugate

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
location if we were to add these to

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
factors together then what we would get

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
is both polls and

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
0 at the origin and

00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in fact then the poll is defined by

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
its angle and this angle

00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
is is

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
eat see the J Omega so far

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
capital see and by its radius

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and this radius is eat to the minors

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
alpha capital T

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
all right now we can look at the frequency response

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
associated with that and and let's just do that

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
for the original

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
continuous-time frequency response

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
what we have is simply a resident character is a show

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
as shown here and if we

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
map this using your post in various which we just did

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the resulting frequency response

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that we get is the frequency response which I indicate

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
we see that that's basically identical

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
to the continuous-time frequency response

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
except for by a linear scaling the frequency axis if you just compare

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
the the dimensions along which the frequency axis is shown

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and for one except for one minor

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
issue which we switch is particularly highlighted

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
when we look at the frequency response at higher frequencies

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
what's the reason why those two curves

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
don't quite follow each other at higher frequencies

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
well the reason is aliasing other words what's happened

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is dead the in the process I'll

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
applying in polls and variance the

00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
frequency response the original continuous-time filter

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
is approximately preserved except for some distortion

00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
thats ocean correspondent aliasing

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
well just for comparison let's look at what

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
would happen if we took the same example and when I can work it through here

00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
carefully

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
waco work through it all not even accurately

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
if we took the same example and mapped it

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
to a discrete-time filter by replacing the rivet is by backward differences

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
what happens in that case is dead we get

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
frequency response that I indicate

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
here and notice dat the resonance

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
in the original continuous-time filter is

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
totally lost in fact

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
basically the character love the continuous-time

00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
frequency responses los what's the reason

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
well the reason goes back to the picture that I drew before

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
the continuous-time filter had a

00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
pair love resident polls close to the jail may axis

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
when those get mapped using back with differences they end up close to this

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
little circle that's inside the unit circle

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
but in fact for this example are far away from the unit circle

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
alright so so far we have

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
one useful technique for mapping continuous I filters to discrete-time

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
filters and apart to highlights are the issues I focused attention also

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
on some not so useful methods

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
namely mapping derivatives to forward or backward differences

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
next time what I would like to do

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is look at impulse invariance

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
for another example namely the design

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
0 a Butterworth filter and all

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
talk more specifically about what butterworth filters or

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
at the beginning that lecture and then in addition

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
what will introduce is another very useful technique

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
which has some difficulties which imposed and variance doesn't have

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
but avoids the principal

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
difficulty that impulse in various does have namely aliasing

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
admitted is referred to as the violin you transformation

00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
which we will to find and

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
utilize next time thank you
