00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ha the

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the norm

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
are

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
last time

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we began the discussion I'll discrete-time processing

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
love continuous-time signals and

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
as a reminder let me review

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the basic notion the idea was

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
dead we convert

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
from a continuous-time signal to a sequence

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
through an operation which I

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
represent as a continuous to discrete-time converter

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then that sequence

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is used as the input to

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
inappropriate discrete-time system

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and after appropriate discrete-time processing

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that sequence is converted

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
back to a continuous-time signal

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
through an operation which i-label as

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
a discrete to continuous-time converter

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
now in the lecture

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
last time we carried out some analysis

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which related 4s the spectra

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in the first step this operation namely

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in the transformation from a continuous-time

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
signal to sequence and

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
let me by the way draw your attention to the fact

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that in the real world this operation

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
is essentially implemented

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
by what you would typically label as an analog to digital converter

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
if in fact the discrete-time processing

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
is being done digitally now it's important to emphasize that it's not

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
exactly what an analog to digital converter

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
does but in some sense at least you should think

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
love this mapping from continuous time to discrete-time

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
in very much the same way there one would think an analog to digital

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
converter

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and the mapping back and is corresponds

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
in some sense to a what would happen

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
with a digital to analog converter well

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
let me review what is involved in the mapping from

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the continuous-time signal to the sequence and

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
let me stress again that this operation

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
is basically in the continues to discrete-time conversion

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a two-step process in

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the first part of the process the continuous-time signal

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
is modulated with an impulse train

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
where the period of the imposed strain is capital T

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and so we have a continuous-time

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
impose Train Signal which captures

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the samples love the original continuous-time signals

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that in Paul strain

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is then put through an operation

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which essentially re labels

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the samples so that the

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
sample values the impulse areas

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
are relabeled as sequence values

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and the result of that conversion is then

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the sequence X event so the overall process then

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is a sampling process followed by

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
what is simply in this box relabeling

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
process and although as I

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
indicated just a minute ago that is essentially what an analog to digital

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
converter does

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
now like to digital converter doesn't necessarily carry it out

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in those two steps but particularly

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
in terms love carrying through an analysis

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
thinking of it as a two-step process is particularly convenient

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
now we talked last time

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
about what this mapping from continuous time to discrete-time

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
means both in the time domain in terms of the spectra

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and in particular in the time domain we

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
begin with the continuous-time signal

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
which is then samples with an impulse train

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and converted to a sequence by

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
simply generating a sequence whose values

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
are the area is love the impulses

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I stress the fact that what this corresponds to

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
essentially is and normalization of the time axis

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
essentially by dividing the time axis by capital T

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in the frequency-domain then

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
we had the spectrum of the original signal

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
which because that the sampling process is

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
replicated at multiples integer multiples

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
all the sampling frequency Omega so badass

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
or to pile over capital T

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and then in converting the impulses

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to a sequence we are essentially

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
normalizing the frequency axis so that

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the frequency to pile over capital T gets relabeled is to pie

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and the resulting discrete-time spectrum looks like

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I indicate here which really is

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
nothing more and a frequency scaling

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
corresponding to the Associated time scaling so the mapping

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
from the imposed strain spectrum to the discrete-time spectrum

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
corresponds to mapping specified

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
by capital Omega equal to small make a times capital T

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
an equivalent Lee it's the frequency

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to pile over capital T which is

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
of course the sampling frequency which gets normalized

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to the frequency to pie

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and so in the frequency domain

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
their is a frequency normalization Associated

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
with the fact dead corresponding to this spectrum

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is a time sequence or discrete time sequence

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
as I show previously and a discrete-time sequence

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is related to the

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
original continuous-time signal

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
through a time normalization in other words

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
these sequence values are simply samples at the continuous-time signal

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
with the time axis we normalized

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
now what we want to consider this is the conversion from continuous time to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
discrete-time

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
what we want to consider now is the overall system

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
which implements not just the conversion but filtering

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and then coming back onto the conversion back to continuous-time

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so let's look at the overall system

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and the overall system courses I've

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
stressed several times in the past consists

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
love first the sampling process

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
conversion to an impulse train

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and the imposed strain converted to a sequence

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that sequence is then processed

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
through are discrete-time filter

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and after the discrete-time processing

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the result of that is converted back

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to an impulse train so this resulting process sequence

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
is then converted back to an impulse train

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and then finally we carry out the the sampling

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
process by simply using a low-pass filter

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Associated with the with the cutoff associated with the sampling frequency

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that we use

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
now typically in a system like that which implements

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
discrete-time processing continuous-time signals

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we either we need to ensure in one way or another

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that the band with love the input is

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
sufficiently limited so that we avoid aliasing

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
one way to do that is to force it in one way or another or

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
simply know that our signal satisfies the band with constrain

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
although a fairly typical thing to do in addition

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
to this sampling process is

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to include what is referred to as

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and anti aliasing filter in other words this is a filter

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that would ban limit the input

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and at least half the sampling frequency

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so that we r guaranteed and

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that their is no aliasing it's carried out

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
in this process and it's important

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
to stress dead in this kinda processing discrete-time processing

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
continuous-time signals except in certain

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
special situations its very important

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to avoid aliasing because we're going to want

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to do a reconstruction after we do the sampling and processing

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
okay now this is the sequence of steps in the time domain

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
let's examine what happens as a consequence is this

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in the frequency domain well

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
let's choose some typeof simple representative spectrum

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and of course what's important about it is that

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the specter that we choose is banned limited or that there's an anti-aliasing

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
filter

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and it's not the shape of course that is critical

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and as we work our way through the system

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
this is the continuous-time spectrum

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
after sampling that spectrum is replicated at

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
multiples of the sampling frequency integer multiples the sampling frequency

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and so

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
there would be another one over here and another one over here at cetera

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and then in converting to a discrete-time sequence

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
their is The Associated

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
frequency normalization so that the sampling frequency

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
yes normalized to a frequency

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to pie okay now at that point

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
where we are in the system

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is at this point

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
so that we've converted to a sequence we now

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
want to carry out some filtering and then after that filtering

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
convert back to a continuous-time signals

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
alright so here we are at the

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
spectrum Associated with the

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
sequence and now

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the processing they were carrying out is

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
linear time-invariant filtering in the discrete time domain

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and what that corresponds to then is multiplying

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
this spectrum by the filter frequency response and I've chosen

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a particular shape and again it's not the shape that's important to the

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
discussion

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but the fact for example that it has a particular cutoff frequency which will

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
kinda track

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
as we work through this and so now

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the spectrum of why I have an the output

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the digital filter is the product this spectrum

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and the 4e a transformer frequency response

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll the digital filter

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
now in working our way through we're going to take the output at the filter

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and undo the two-step process so we now want to take that sequence

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
converted to an impulse train and then take then imposed strain

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Andy sample through a low-pass filter

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
so here we are now at the output to the digital filter

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
we then convert that to an impulse train well that's really on doing the original

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
time normalization

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and so what that means is that we

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
are on doing the frequency normalization in particular

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we're dividing the frequency axis by

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
capital T whereas this point

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
in y Omega was to pie

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
now it's to pile over capital T

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
what that means is that acquittal and Lee were multiplying this spectrum

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
by the frequency response the digital filter

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but now linearly scaled in frequency

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
so that will what was a cutoff frequency Omega subsea

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is now a cutoff frequency up Omega subsea

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
divided by capital T so

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
now the next step in the process is the reconstructing

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
low-pass filter and what that extracts is simply the portion

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'll this periodic spectrum around the origin

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and so finally and spectrum of the output

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
up the overall system will be the spectrum

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
of the input multiplied

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
by a frequency response

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
which is the digital filter frequency response

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
frequency scaled by dividing

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that digital filter frequency axis by capital T

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
okay now what we can ask is

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
we've got this processing we've converted to discrete-time we've gone

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
back to continuous-time

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and one can ask now what acquittal and

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
overall continuous-time systems is that correspond to

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
in other words if we that of course is a continuous-time system it's a continuous

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
time you put a continuous-time output

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and the overall system dan

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
would be one that would give us exactly the same output spectrum

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
as we're getting well what is that well we have

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
is an output spectrum which is the product

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
all the input spectrum and digital filter frequency characteristic

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
frequency scale and so in fact

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the resulting digital filter I'm sorry continuous-time

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
filter is simply the digital filter

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
with inappropriate frequency scaling

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in other words with the frequency axis divided by capital T

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
so sent another way if

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
we show here

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the frequency response or the

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
original digital filter

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
then the corresponding continuous-time

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
filter would be this

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
frequency scaled and then because love

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The Associated low-pass filtering in the reconstruction

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
we would select out just one of these periods in particular the portion around

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the origin

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and the essential consequences that is that the corresponding

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
continuous-time filter then is

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
given by this and these two are related

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
simply by a linear scaling the frequency axis

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and note dead where the digital filter has a cutoff frequency

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Omega subsea the continuous-time filter

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
has a cutoff frequency Omega subsea divided by capital T

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
so that's the linear frequency scaling and

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
by the way plant away for now and will return to this point later

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
plant the way for now the the observation

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
dad even if the digital filter frequency response

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is fixed which we would assume it is

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
by changing the sampling frequency in fact

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
what we're able to do is a fact a linear scaling

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
or the acquittal in continuous-time

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
okay well this is pretty much the process in the analysis

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but to highlight a number the issues and emphasize these points

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
why I like to do is illustrate

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
somewhat this with a videotape demonstration

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that in fact was made originally as part of another course a course

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
devoted entirely to

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
digital signal processing which essentially is discrete-time processing

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
whether or not it's related to continuous-time signals

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and what I'd like to now focus on

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
are summer the details of that demonstration

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
in the demonstration the

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
specific impulse response there

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is used for the digital filter

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
or discrete-time filter is the one that I show here

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and the Associated

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
frequency response is the frequency response

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
love a discrete-time low-pass filter as i indicate below

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and the cutoff frequency that filter as i indicate the filter was designed as a

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
discreet I felt with the cutoff frequency hi over five

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and let me just draw your attention to the fact that

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
pie over five is also

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
10 love to pie

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and so in fact the digital

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
for discrete-time filter cutoff frequency is a tenth

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to pie and as all stress again shortly

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
remember that in the frequency normalization

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
or a normalization to pie represents

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in effect the sampling frequency and so

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the consequence of that is that cutoff frequency really is going to be

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
associated

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
with the 10th all the sampling frequency but for now keep in mind that is just

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
simply attentive to

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
on now the

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
equivalent continuous-time

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
system interns are the impulse response

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is of course a ban limited interpolation

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
love the up the

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
impose response associated with the discrete-time

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
filter and in the frequency domain the frequency response

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
is correspondingly a timescale

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and a timescale I'm sorry a frequency scale

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
version at the frequency response so in fact

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in the frequency domain and in the time domain

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
related to the continuous-time signal

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the Associated impulse response is

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
what I indicate here a ban limited interpolation

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or the discrete-time impulse response

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and time scale than

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and the frequency response following the discussion that we've previously gone

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
through

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is a frequency scale version all the one associated with the digital filter

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
well the first thing that all want to look at is

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
the impulse response and when we do

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
let me just indicate that

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
in the actual implementation things are slightly different

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
then they are associated with the ideal analysis

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
in particular in converting

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
from a discrete-time sequence

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
to the continuous-time signal whereas

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
this way of looking at it is convenient

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in the context that the analysis in fact the way it's done

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
is is using more or less

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
standard digital to analog converter

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
one what a digital to analog converter does as i indicated in the previous

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
lecture

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is to convert the sequence

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
not to an impulse train but in fact to go directly through

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
zero-order hold and so usually what comes onto

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
a digital to analog converter is a staircase

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
tightness signal associated with the zero-order hold

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and then the result of that is low-pass filter to do the reconstruction

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
so what we want to look at and is

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that reconstruction first with just an impulse input

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and so what we'll see after the low-pass filter

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
for the impulse response is

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
a smooth curve like this but also as part of the demonstration

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
what all do just to show the zero-order hold

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
is to take the low-pass filter out temporarily

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and then put it back in so first let's just look at

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the filter impulse response

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
what we see here is the impost response

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
all the overall system and

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
we observe for one thing that it's a symmetrical impulse response in other

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
words corresponds to a linear phase filter

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
we can also look at the impulse response before that the same playing

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
low-pass filter let's take out that the sampling low-pass filter

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
slowly and wide

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
we observe is basically the output I'll

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the digital to analog converter which of course is a staircase a boxcar function

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
not an impulse train in the real world the

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
output over the day converted generally is a boxcar type function

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
we can put the the sampling filter back in now

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and notice that the effectivity sampling filter is basically

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to smooth out the rough edges in

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the boxcar output from the DA converter

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
okay so that's the impulse response the system

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
now what I like to show is the frequency

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
response the system and to measure the frequency response of course what we can

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
do

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is put a sine wave

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
into the system and looked at

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the sinusoidal output so in particular now what will happen is that

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
with the system we will put in

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
a continuous-time sinusoid which is sampled

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
converted to a sequence

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
the sample continues sigh sinus so it is a discrete-time sinusoid

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that goes through the digital filter and gets attenuated or

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
amplified appropriately and then

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
the output if that is converted back and that's

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
again a sinusoidal output that gets converted back

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
to a continuous-time sinusoid

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
theoretically as i indicate here but again as we just saw

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
really represented by zero-order hold followed by

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
a low-pass filter so thats

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the overall operation with one

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
modification from the diagram that we have here

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in this particular diagram I've included

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
a and anti-aliasing filter

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
in fact in the demonstration there is no

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
anti-aliasing filter and so

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
in fact the input is a sinusoidal input

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
which is not band limited

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
by virtue of an anti-aliasing filter it's only

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
course been limited appropriately

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
if we choose the sinusoidal frequency that way

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
so there is no anti-aliasing filter and this is the system

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and one consequence if that

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is dead in fact if we sweep

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the input sinusoid only up to half the sampling frequency

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
will see no aliasing but if we let its we passed that we're going to get

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
aliasing

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
now in the demonstration the sampling rate

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
its picked for this party the demonstration is a 20 kilohertz sampling

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
rate

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that means based on the sampling theorem that as long as the input frequency

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
is below 10 killer hurts we get no aliasing

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
when the input frequency goes beyond 10 killer hurts

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that higher frequency is going to get alias down

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
into a lower frequency a consequence is that then

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
is that as we go through the process saying

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and we demonstrate the frequency response to the system

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
what we'll see in the output is

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
no alias saying when the input is below 10 killer hurts

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
as the input sweeps past 10 killer hurts

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
when when we let it which we will eventually in the demonstration

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
dan in fact that frequency as it finally shows up here

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
will begin to be aliased down into a lower frequency

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
another way thinking about that is dead

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
when we watch the frequency response

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
love the system as

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
we look at the digital filter frequency response

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
what we're sweeping and as we go from zero

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
up to 10 killer hurts

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
in the input frequency is this portion of the frequency response

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
as we sweep from 10 killer hurts out to 20 kilohertz

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
what we'll see is this portion the frequency response

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
in other words will see it periodically replicate

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or if we look at the

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
corresponding continuous-time frequency response

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
what it means really is that sweeping

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
from 0 to 10 killer hurts

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
is moving up this way and then sweeping from 10 killer hurts

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
to 20 kilohertz on the input

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
really because if the alias saying

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
reflects itself in a digital filter by

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
looking back down it toward lower frequencies and so the continuous-time

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
filter

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
sweeps back down from 10 killer hurts

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
back 20 okay

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
so that so we'll see and we'll see it in several different ways as explained in

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the demonstration

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
so now let's look and the frequency response

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
sold now we like to illustrate

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
is the frequency response love the acquittal in continuous-time

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
filter and we can do that by sweeping the filter with a sinusoidal input

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
so what we'll see in this demonstration is

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
on the upper trace the input sinusoid on the lower trace the output sinusoid

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
using a 20 kilohertz sampling rate in a sweep

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
from 0 to 10 killer hurts in other words a sweep from 0 to

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
effectively hi interns at the digital filter

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so work will observe as the input frequency increases

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is that the output sinusoid will have essentially constant amplitude

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
up to the cutoff frequency the filter and then approximately zero amplitude

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
past so let's now sweet the filter

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
frequency response

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and the area is the filter

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
cutoff frequency

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
now we can also observe the filter frequency response in

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
several other ways one way in which we can observe it is by

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
looking also at the amplitude if the output sinusoid as

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
a function of frequency rather than as a function of time

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and so will observe that on the left-hand SCO

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
while on the right-hand scope will have the same trace their we just saw

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
namely to traces the upper traces the input sinusoid

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the lower traces the output sinusoid and in addition to observing

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the frequency response let's also listen to the output sinusoid

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and observe the attenuation

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
in the output as we go from the field to pass band to the filter stopping again a

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
20 kilohertz sampling rate

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and a sweep range from 0 to 10 killer now

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
course when the filter stop

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
now if we increase the sweep range

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
from 10 killer hurts the 20 kilohertz

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
so that the sweep range is equal to the sampling frequency

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
in essence that corresponds the sweeping at the digital filter

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
from 0 to 2pi and in that case we'll begin to see

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
some %uh the periodicity in the digital filter frequency response

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so let's do that now with 20 kilohertz sampling rate

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and a sweep range is 0 to 20 kilohertz

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
now as we come near to Pine

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
we get back into the past

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
an finally back to

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
a0 to 10 killer hurts we so they were again sweeping

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
only from 0 to 2pi with regard to the digital filter

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
now an important observation is that

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
with the digital or discrete-time

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
filter cutoff frequency fixed as i've indicated here

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and I remind you that what the cutoff frequency is

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
is a 10 to hi with that cutoff frequency fixed

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because I love the normalization that we get

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
as we come back to a continuous-time

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
filter in fact what we have

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is a cutoff frequency dead is

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
dependent on the sampling frequency or on the sampling period

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and more specifically since the discrete-time or digital

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
filter has a cutoff frequency which is attentive to pie

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the normalization as you recall

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
is dead to pie in discrete-time frequency

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
corresponds to Omega sed s/ the sampling frequency

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
in terms of continuous-time frequency the consequence

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
is dead this cutoff frequency in fact

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is 110 all

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
not to pine now because at the normalization its 110

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll the sampling frequency so

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
consequently as we change the sampling frequency

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
what will happen is that even with the discrete-time filter cutoff fixed

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
the cutoff frequency I'll the equivalent continuous-time

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
filter will change now

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
that's what I want to demonstrate but let me

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
again stress and ask you to keep in mind dead

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
this demonstration is done without an anti-aliasing filter in

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and we are going to be changing the sampling frequency

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and so keep in mind dead as

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
we look at this as the input frequency

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
sweeps past half the sampling frequency whatever sampling frequency we happen to

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
be looking at

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
then because the fact that there's no anti-aliasing filter

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
will get daily as saying in other words the frequency in the digital filter

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
discrete-time filter as we sweep the input frequency up

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
will move up in frequency until we get

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
past half the sampling frequency and then essentially will move back down

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
frequency consequently what will get

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
then are or we'll see our periodic replications

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
the frequency response when we swept past have see half the sampling alright

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so now

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
let's look at the same digital filter

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but the frequency response as

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
we change the sampling frequency now

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
what we would like to demonstrate is the effective changing the same thing

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
frequency and we know that

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the sampling that the effective filter cutoff frequency

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is tied to the sampling frequency

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and for this particular filter corresponds to attend

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
of the sampling frequency consequently if we double the sampling frequency we

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
should double

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the affective filter past and where war

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
double the filter cutoff frequency and

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
so let's do that now it again is 0-10 killer hurt sweep range

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but a forty kilohertz sampling frequency

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
me and

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
we should observe that the filter cutoff frequency has now doubled

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
out 24 killer now

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
let's begin to decrease the filter sampling frequency

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
so from forty let's change the sampling frequency to 20 kilohertz

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
we should see the cutoff frequency cut in half me

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
now we can go even further we can cut the sampling frequency down

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
10 killer hurts and remember that the sweep range is 0 to 10 killer hurt so

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
now will be sweeping from 0 to 2pi

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
so as we get close to two pi will see the passband again

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and now

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
let's cut down the sampling frequency even further

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to by kilohertz my

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
here we are at 2pi

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and then

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
at for pop alright so

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that illustrates the effective changing the sampling frequency

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
now let's conclude this demonstration at the effect

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
on the sampling frequency on the filter cutoff frequency by carrying out some

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
filtering

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
on some live audio white will

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
watching this case is the output

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
audio waveform as a function of time

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
on the single trace go and also

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
will listen to the output will begin it with a forty killer hurts

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
sampling rate then reduce that to 20 kilohertz 10 killer hurts and then five

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
alerts

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and in each of those cases the effective filter cutoff frequency

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
then is cut in half from for keywords to kill hurts

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
21 kilohertz and then to 500 cycles so let's begin with the forty killer hurt

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
sampling frequency

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
or ineffective filter cutoff frequency of work killer

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
now let's reduce net 20 kilohertz am

00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
frequency or to kill hurts filter

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and 10 kelleher sampling frequency

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
then finally in my Google Earth family

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
cigars running to me why minor in Psych grueling

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
analog all the

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I now let's finally include why returning to

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
a little higher quality ragtime like me the same

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
theme

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
right well hopefully

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
what you've seen in the demonstration and in this lecture

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
is gives you a sense of feeling

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
for the analysis and the use

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll discrete-time filters

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
for processing continuous-time signals and

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
as you may be aware and as I've tried to indicate

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
previously in the past this in fact is

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
one very important but not the only but one very important

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
context in which discrete-time filtering

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
issues and this in fact is

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
an area that is developing rapidly because at the fact dead

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
microprocessors digital technology computers et cetera

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
afford considerable flexibility

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in carrying out digital processing of signals

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and it is and went digital processing is used at

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
naturally corresponds

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to to implementing the processing

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and analyzing it in discrete-time now

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
in the next lecture will be continuing

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
on another aspect developing another aspect

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
love sampling any particular

00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
what we'll be talking about is sampling of discrete-time signals

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
as all indicate there one of the contexts in which

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
discrete-time sampling in fact plays an important role

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
is in the context in which

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
we are processing continuous-time signals

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
using discrete time processing where in fact

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
one step that we might want to take in addition to the steps that we've talked

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
about here

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
is an additional sampling process following

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
whatever kinds of filtering that we that we do well that's a discussion and a

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
topic that will be going into in the next lecture

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
thank you
