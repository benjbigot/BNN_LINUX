the new the last time

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we began the development love the discrete-time

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
for EA transform and

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
just days with the continuous-time case we first

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
treated the notion a periodic signals this led to the forty a series

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then we generalize that to the Fourier transform

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and finally incorporated within the framework for the four th

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
transform both a periodic and periodic signals

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in today's lecture but I'd like to do

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is expand on some other properties

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
love for EA transform and indicate how those properties are used for a variety

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of things

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
well let's begin by reviewing the Fourier transform

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
as we develop did last time it of course involves

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
a synthesis equation and and analysis equation

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the synthesis equation expressing X a van

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the sequence in terms of the Fourier transform

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
any analysis equation telling us how to obtain

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the Fourier transform from the original sequence

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and I draw your attention again to

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the basic point that the synthesis equation

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
essentially corresponds to decomposing

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the sequence as a linear combination

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
of complex exponentials with amplitude said are in effect

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
proportional to the 48 transport now

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
in the discrete-time Fourier transform just as the continuous-time

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
for a transform has a number all

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
important and useful properties of course

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as i stress last time it's a function 0

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
a continuous variable and it's also a complex-valued function

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which means dead when we represented in general

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
requires a representation in terms of its

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
real part an imaginary part or in terms of magnitude and angle

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
also as i indicated last time

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the Fourier transform is

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
a periodic function of frequency

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and the periodicity is

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
with a period up to par i and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so it says in effect dead the Fourier transform if we replace the frequency

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
variable

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
by an integer multiple to pie

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the function repeats and I stress again

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that the underlying basis

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
for this periodicity property is the fact

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that its the setup complex exponentials

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that are inherently periodic in frequency

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and so of course any representation using them would

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in effect generate a

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
periodicity with this period of two pi

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
just an is

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
in continuous-time the Fourier transform has

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
important symmetry properties and in particular

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
if the sequence x7 is

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
real value an the 4e

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
transform is conjugate symmetric

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in other words if we replace Omega by minus Omega

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that's equivalent to applying complex conjugation to the 48 transport and

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as a cock consequence this conjugate symmetry

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
this results in asymmetry

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in the real part that is an even symmetry

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
or the magnitude has an even symmetry

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
whereas the imaginary part or the phase angle

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is are are both art summit and these are symmetry properties again

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that are identical to the symmetry properties that we saw in

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
continuous-time

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
well let's see this in the context I'll an example that we worked last time and

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
will want to draw attention to

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in reference to several issues is this lecture goes along

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and that is the Fourier transform all

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
a real damp expanding exponential

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
so the sequence that we

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
are talking about is a to the end you have an

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and let's consider a to be positive

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
we saw last time that the Fourier transform from the for this sequence

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
algebraically is up this form

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and if we look at its magnitude and angle

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the magnet to I show here

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and the magnitude as we see has the properties that we indicated

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is and even function of frequency

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
course it's a function of a continuous variable

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it in addition is periodic

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
with a period of two part

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
on the other hand if we look at the phase angle below it

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the phase angle has a symmetry which is ought symmetric

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and that's indicated clearly in this picture

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and of course in addition to being eyed symmetric it naturally has to be

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
again a periodic function of frequency

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
with the period up to par

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
okay so we have some symmetry properties we have this inherent periodicity in the

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
48 transform which

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
arms stressing very heavily because it forms

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the basic difference between continuous-time and discrete-time

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
in addition to these properties have the four EA transform

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
there are a number of other properties

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
day are particularly useful in

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the manipulation of the 48 transform and in fact

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
using the Fourier transform to for example

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
an ally systems represented by when you're past the coefficient difference

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
equations

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
bear in the text is a

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
longer list the properties but let me just draw your attention

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to several of them one

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is the time shifting property

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and the time shifting property tells us dead

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
if Xserve Omega is the Fourier transform

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
objective and then the Fourier transform

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
are x7 shifted in time

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
is that same for EA transform multiplied by

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
this factor which is a with your face fact

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
so time-shifting introduces

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a linear phase turn and by the way I recall

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that in the continuous-time case we had a similar situation namely that a

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
timeshare

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
corresponded to a linear phase

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
there also is a dual to the time shifting property

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
which is referred to as the frequency shifting property

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
which tells us dead if we

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
multiply a time function by a complex exponential

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that in effect generates

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
a frequency share and will see this frequency shifting property

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
surface in a slightly different way shortly

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
when we talk about the modulation property in the discrete-time case

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
another important property that will want to make you so

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
shortly is Lenny arity which follows in a very straightforward way from

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the Fourier transform definition

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the linearity property says simply

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that the 48 transform of Assam

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
or linear combination is the same with your combination the Fourier transforms

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
again that's a property that we saw in continuous-time

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and also among other properties

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
there is a parser balls relation for the discrete-time case

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
then in effect says something similar to continuous-time

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
specifically dead the energy E

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
in the sequence is proportional

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to the energy E in the 48 transform

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the energy over one period or said another way

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
in fact or another way that it can be said is

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that the energy in the time domain is proportional to the power

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in his periodic for a transport

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
okay so these are some other properties

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in and are the as i indicated parallel somewhat properties that we saw in

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
continuous-time

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
two additional properties their will play important roles

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
indiscreet I'm just as they did in continuous-time

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
are the convolution property and the modulation property

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the convolution property is the property that tells us

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
how to relate the Fourier transform

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
all the convolution two sequences

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to the Fourier transforms of the individual sequences

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and not surprisingly what happens and this can be

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
demonstrated algebraically not surprisingly

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the four EA transform above the convolution

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is simply the product of the Fourier transforms

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
so Fourier transform maps

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
convolution in the time domain the multiplication in the frequency domain

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
now convolutional courses arises in the context of linear time-invariant systems

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
in particular if we have a system with an impulse response a true fan

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
input excessive and the output is the convolution

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the convolution property then tells us dead

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in the frequency domain for EA transform

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is the product love the Fourier transform

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the impulse response and the forty a transformer the input

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
now we also saw

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and have talked about a relationship between

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the Fourier transform the impulse response and what we called

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the frequency response

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
in the context love the response to the system

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to a complex exponential specifically

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
complex exponentials are I can functions have linear time-invariant systems

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
wanna be's into the system gives us as an output

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
a complex exponential with the same complex frequency

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
multiplied by what you referred to as the eye can value

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and as you saw in the

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
video course manual this I can value this constant multiplier

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
on the exponential is in fact

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the 48 transform up the impulse response

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
evaluated at that frequency

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
now we saw exactly the same statement

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
in continuous-time and in fact we use

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that statement the frequency response interpretation

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
love the 48 trance for the impulse response

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
we use that to motivate and intuitive interpretation

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of the convolution property now formally the convolution property can be

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
developed by

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
taking the convolution some applying the Fourier transforms into it

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
doing the appropriate substitution variables in a changing order summations

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Center in all the algebra

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
works out to show that it's a product but as I stressed

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
when we discussed this with continuous time the interpretation the underlying

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
interpretation

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is particularly important to understand so let me review it again

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
in the discrete-time case and it's exactly the same

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
for discrete-time for continuous-time

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
specifically the argument was that the Fourier transform

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
all a sequence or signal

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
exponentials

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
what the airport to those complex exponentials its

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
basically proportional to the four EA transport

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
if we think a pushing through the system that linear combination

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
then each love those complex exponentials

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
gets the airport to modified are multiplied

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
by the Fourier transform all up by the frequency response

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
which we saw is the Fourier transform love the impulse response

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
so the airport to up the output complex exponentials

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is then the amplitudes of the input complex exponentials

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
multiplied by the frequency response

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and the Fourier transform the output in effect

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is an expression its expressing the summation

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
or integration of the output as a linear combination of all of these exponentials

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
with the appropriate complex amplitudes

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
so its important in thinking about

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
the convolution property to think about it in terms

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
a nothing more then the fact that we decompose the input

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and we're now modifying separately

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
through multiplication scaling

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the airport to or each of the complex exponential company

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
now what we saw in continuous time is that this interpretation

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and the convolution property

00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
lead to an important concept namely the concept the filtering

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
kind of the idea that if we decompose the input as a linear combination of

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
complex exponentials

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we can separately attenuator amplify

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
each of those compounds and in fact

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
we could exactly pass some center frequencies and totally eliminate other

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
center frequencies

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
so again just as in continuous-time

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
we can talk about an ideal filter

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and what I show here is the frequency response

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
love idea low-pass filter

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the idea low-pass filter of course passes

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
exactly with a gain of one

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
frequencies around zero and eliminates

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
totally other frequencies

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
however an important distinction here between continuous-time and

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
discrete-time

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
is the fact that whereas in continuous time when we talked about an ideal

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
filter

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
we passed a band of frequencies and totally eliminate everything else out to

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
infinity

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in a discrete-time case the frequency response

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
is periodic so obviously

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the frequency response must periodically repeat

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the low low-pass filter and in fact we see that here

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
if we look at the low-pass filter

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
then we've eliminated some frequencies

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but then we passive course frequencies

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
around to pie and also frequencies

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
around minus 25 for that matter around any multiple

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
to pie although it's important to recognize

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that because of the inherent periodicity at the complex exponentials

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
these frequencies are exactly the same frequencies

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
as these frequencies so

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
its low-pass filtering interpreted in terms of frequencies over a range

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
from minus buy the pie

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
well just as we talk about a low-pass filter we can also talk about

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
a high pass filter and a high pass filter course with

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
past high frequencies

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in a continuous-time case high frequencies man frequencies that

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
go out to infinity in the discrete-time case

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
course the highest frequencies we can generate our frequencies up the pie

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and wants are complex exponentials go past pie

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
then in fact we start seeing the lower frequencies again might be

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
indicate what I mean if we think

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in the context of the low-pass filter these are low frequencies

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
as we move along the frequency axis these become high frequencies

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and as we move further along the frequency axis

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
what we'll see when we get to for example frequency

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to pie are the same low frequencies

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
that we see around zero a particular then

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
a and i do. high pass filter in the discrete-time case

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
would be a filter that eliminates these frequencies

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and passes frequencies around pie

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
okay so and we've seen the

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
convolution property and its interpretation in terms of filtering

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
more broadly the convolution property in combination

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
with a number of the other properties today introduced in particular the time

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
shifting and when the arity property

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
allows us to generator analyzes

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the an ally systems that are described by linear constant coefficient

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
difference equations

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and this again pareles very strongly

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the discussion that we carried out in the continuous-time

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
case their particular let's

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
think I love a discrete-time system

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
there is described by when your car is the coefficient difference equation

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and will restrict the initial conditions on the equation

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
such that it corresponds to linear time-invariant system

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and recall that in fact in our discussion

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
when your constant coefficient difference equations

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is the condition of initial rest

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
there on the equation that guarantees

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
4s that the system will be causal linear and time-invariant

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
okay now let's consider

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
a first-order difference equation system described by first-order difference

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
equation and we've talked about the solution of this equation before

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
essentially we run the solution recur simply

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
let's now consider generating the solution by

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
taking advantage the properties the forty a transport

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
well just as we did in continuous time we can consider

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
applying to 48 transformed to both sides of this equation

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and the Fourier transform are why I have been

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
courses y Omega and then using the shifting

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
property the time shifting property the Fourier transform why event -1

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
is y Omega multiplied by

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you to the minus jail make and so we have this

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
using the when the arity property we can carry down the scale factor in and these

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
two together as they read it here

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and forty a transformer victim and is XO make

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
well Wii console this equation

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the Fourier transform of the output in terms of the Fourier transform

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
up the input and a

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
inappropriate complex scale factor and simply solving this

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
for y Omega yields what we have here

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
now what we've used in going from this point to this point

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
is both the shifting property

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and we've also used the linearity property

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
at this point we can recognize that

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
here the Fourier transform the output is the product

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the Fourier transform of the input and

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
some complex function and from the convolution property

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
then that complex function must in fact

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
correspond to the frequency response

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
or acquittal atlee the 48 transform

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
love the impulse response so if we wanted to determine the Fourier

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
transform

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
or the or where the impulse response to the system

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
let's say for example then it becomes a matter

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
love having identified the 4e a transformer the impulse response which

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
is the frequency response

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
we now want to inverse transform to get the impulse response

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
well how do we inverse transform of course we could do it by attempting to

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
go through the synthesis equation

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
for the Fourier transform or we can do is we did

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
in a continuous-time case which is to take advantage

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I love what we know and in particular

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
we know dead from an example that we work before

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
this is in fact the 48 transform

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
all a sequence which is

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
a to the N times

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you then and so in essence by inspection

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
very similar to what has going on can

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
in continuous-time essentially by inspection

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
we can then solve for the impulse response to the system

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
okay so that procedure follows very much

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the kind of procedure that we've carried out in continuous-time

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and this is the course is discussed in more detail

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
in the text well let's

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
a look at that example

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
then here we have the impulse response

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
for that for associated with the system described by that particular

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
difference equation and to the right of that

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
we have the Associated frequency response

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and one other things that we notice and this is drawn for a

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
positive between 0&1 what we noticed in fact is that

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
it is an approximation to

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
a low-pass filter because it tends to attenuate

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
the high frequencies and retain and in fact

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
amplify the low-frequency now

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
if instead actually the impulse response

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
was such that we picked a to be negative between minus 10

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and the impulse response in the time domain looks like this

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and the corresponding frequency response

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
looks like this and that becomes an approximation

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
to a high pass filter

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
so in fact a first-order difference equation

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
as we see has a frequency response depending on the value obey

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
dad either looks approximately like a low-pass filter for a positive or a high

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
pass filter for a negative

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
very much like the first order differential equation

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
looked like a low-pass filter in the continuous-time

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
case and in fact I'd like to illustrate

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is the filtering characteristics

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
for example love filtering using first-order difference equation

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and the example that a lil astray

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
is filtering over sequence that in fact is filtered very often

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
for a very practical reasons namely a sequence which represents the Dow Jones

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Industrial Average

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
over a fairly long period and

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
will process the Dow Jones Industrial Average first

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
through first-order difference equation where if we begin

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
with a sequel 0 then referring to the frequency response

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
that we have here equal 0 would simply be

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
passing all frequencies as a as positive

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
we start to retain mostly low frequencies

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and the larger a gets but still less than 1

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the more it attenuates high frequencies at the expensive low frequencies

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
so let's watch the filtering first

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
with a positive and we'll see if behave as a low pass filter and then

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
with a negative and we'll see

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the difference equation behaving as a high pass filter

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
what we see here is the Dow Jones Industrial Average over

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
roughly a five year period from 1927 to 1930 to

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and in fact that big dip in the middle

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
is the famous stock market crash of 1929

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and we can see that following that in fact the market continued

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
a very long downward trend and

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
what we now want to do is process this

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
through a difference equation

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
above the Dow Jones average we show the impulse response to the difference

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
equation here

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
we've chosen the parameter a equal to 0

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and the impulse response will be displayed on

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
in expanded scale in relation to

00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the scale love the input and for that matter the scale of the output

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
now with the impulse response shown here which is just an impulse

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
in fact the output shown on the bottom trace

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is exactly identical to the input

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and what will want to do now is increase

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
first the parameter a and the impulse response

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
will begin to look like an exponential

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
with a duration: that's longer and longer as

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
a moves from 0 to 1

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
correspondingly we will get more and more low pass filtering as the

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
coefficient a

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
increases from 0 toward one so now

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
we are increasing the parameter a we see that

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the bottom trace in relation to the middle trace in fact is

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
looking more and more smooth or

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
low-pass filtered and here now we have

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
a fair amount of smoothing to the point where the stock market crash of 1929

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
is totally lost in fact I'm sure there are many people who

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
wish that through filtering we could in fact have avoided the stock market crash

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
altogether

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
now let's decrease

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
a from one back toward zero

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and as we do that we will be taking out

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
the low-pass filtering and when they finally reaches

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
0 the impulse response to the filter will again

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
be in in polls and so the output will be

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
once again identical to the input

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and that's where we are now

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
right now we want to continue to decrease

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
a so that it becomes negative moving

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
from zero toward -1 and what we will see in that case

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
is more and more high-pass filtering

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
on the output in relation to the input

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and this will be particularly evident in again

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the region a pipe frequencies represented by sharp transitions which

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,000
of course

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
the market crash goodnight 1929 would represent

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
so here now a is decreasing

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
toward -1 we see that the high frequencies

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
or rapid variations are emphasize

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and finally let's move from -1

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
back toward zero taking out the high-pass filtering

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and ending up with

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
equal to 0 corresponding to an impulse response which is an impulse

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
in other words and identity system and let me stress once again that

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
the time scale on which we displayed the impulse response

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
is an expanded time scale in relation to the timescale

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
on which we displayed the input and the output

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
okay so we see that in fact a

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
first-order difference equation is

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
a filter and in fact it's a very important class the filters and its use

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
very often to do

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
approximate low-paying some high-pass filtering

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
now in addition to

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the convolution property another

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
important property that we had in continuous-time and that we have in

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
discrete-time

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is the modulation property the modulation property tells us

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
what happens in the frequency domain when

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you multiply signals in the time domain

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
in continuous-time the modulation property corresponded to the statement

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that if we multiply in the time domain

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we convolved the 48 transforms

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
in the frequency domain and in discrete-time

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
we have very much the same

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
kinda relationship

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
the only real distinction between the

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
is is that in the discrete-time case

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
in carrying out the convolution its integration

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
only over a two-party interval and

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
what that corresponds to is what's referred to as

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
a periodic convolution

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
as opposed to the continuous-time case

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
where what we have is a convolution

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
that is a periodic on pollution

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
so again we have a convolution property in discrete-time

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that is very much like the convolution property in continuous-time

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the only real difference is that here work involving

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
periodic functions and so

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
its a periodic convolution which involves integration only over to pie

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and herbal

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
rather than in immigration from minus infinity the question

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
well let's and take a look at the

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
example love the modulation property which will then

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
leave to one particular application and a very useful application

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
love the modulation property in discrete-time

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
example that I 12 pic is

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
example in which we consider modulating a signal

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
with a signal with another signal

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
X evander x1 event as i indicated

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
here which is -1 to the end

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
essentially with that says is that

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
any signal which I modulate with this effect corresponds to taking the

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
original signal

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and then going through that signal alternating

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the algebraic sign

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
now we in in applying the modulation property of course

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
what we need to do is develop the 48 transform

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
this signal this signal which I

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
rewrite I can ride either is -1 to the air to rewrite is you DJ pie and since

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
you the J pie

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is equal to -1 is a periodic signal

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and if the periodic signal that I show here

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and recall that to get the 48 transform other periodic signal

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
one way to do it is to

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
generate the forty a series coefficients for the periodic signal

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and then identify the Fourier transform as an impulse train

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
where the heights of the impulses in the impulse train

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
are proportional the proportionality factor to pry

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
proportional 240 a series coefficients

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so let's first workout what the for a series is it for this example

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
in fact it's fairly easy here is

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the general synthesis equation for

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the forty a series and

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
if we take our particular example

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
where if we look back at the curve above

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
what we recognize is that the period

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
is equal to 2 merely repeat after two points

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
then capital in is equal to two

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and so we can just write this out with the two turns

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and the two terms involved are x1 a van is a0

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
0 go fishin as cake 0

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
in a1 and this is with

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
cake was one we substituted in capital an equal to two

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
right well we can do a little bit about to bring here obviously

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
cross of the factors to and what we recognize

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
if we compare this expression with

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the original signal which is you the j-pop I N

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
then we can simply identify the fact dead

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
80 0 coefficient is zero that's the DC term

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and call fish in a1 is equal to 1

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
so we've done it simply by essentially

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
inspecting the for EA

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
series synthesis equation

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
okay now if we want to get the Fourier transform for this we take those

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
coefficients

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
an essentially generate

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
an impulse train where we

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
chooses values for the impulses to pie

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
times the forty a series coefficients

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
so before a series coefficients array0 sequel to zero in a one is equal to 1

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
so noticed that in

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the plot that I shown here above the 40 a transform

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
love x1 a band we have the zeroth coefficient which happens to be 0

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and so I haven't indicated impose

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
there we have the

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
coefficient a one and the coefficient a1

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
occurs at a frequency which is

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Omega 0 and Omega 0 in fact is equal to hi

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
because the signal is the the j-pop I N

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
well in what's this impulse over here

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
well any polls is ace

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
corresponds to the four-day series go fishin a sieve -1

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and of course if we drew this out

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
over a longer frequency axis we would see lots of other impulses

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
because it the fact that the four th transform periodically repeats

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
or equipment leader for a series coefficients periodically

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
p so this is the coefficient

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
80 this is the coefficient

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a one with a factor to pie this is 25 times a zero

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and two pi times they won

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and then this is simply an indication

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
that is periodically repeated

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
right now let's consider what happens if we take a signal

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and multiplier modulated by

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
-1 to the end well in the frequency domain

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that corresponds to a convolution

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
let's consider a signal x2 a van

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
which has a $4 EA transform as i've indicated here

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
then the Fourier transform the product

00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
affects 1 event next to %uh van is the convolution

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
up these two spectra and

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
recall that if you can fall something

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
with an impulse train is this is that simply corresponds to taking the

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
something

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and placing it at the positions love

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
should the impulses so in fact

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the result the convolution this with this

00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
would then be the spectrum their I indicate here

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
namely this spectrum shifted up to pie

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and of course two-minus by and then

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
of course to not only Piper three pie in five

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
by et cetera et cetera and

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
so this spectrum finally corresponds to

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
the Fourier transform -1 to the end

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
times X to have an where x2 event is the sequence

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
spectrum was x2 make

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
okay now this is in fact important

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
useful and interesting point what it says is

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I have a signal with a certain spectrum and if I

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
modulate multiply that signaled by -1 to the end

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
meeting that I alternate the signs then

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
it takes the low frequencies in effect the ship's the spectrum by pie

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
so it takes the low frequencies and moves them up the high frequencies

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and will incidently take the high frequencies and movement the low

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
frequency

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
so in fact we in essence saw this when we

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
so or twenty talked about the example love

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
a sequence which was aided the end times you have an

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
notice let me draw your attention to the fact dead

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
when a is positive we have

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
this sequence and its Fourier transform

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is as II show on the right

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
for a negative

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the sequence is

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
the identical to a positive but with alternating signs

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and the Fourier transform it that you can now see

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and verify also algebraically

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
if you'd like is identical to this spectrum

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
simply shifted by pie

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
so it says in fact that multiplying

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that impulse response or if we think I've a positive and a negative

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that is algebraically similar to multiplying

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
the impulse response by -1 to the end and in the frequency domain

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the affected that essentially is shifting the spectrum by pie

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
we can interpret that in the context that the modulation property

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
now it's interesting that

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
what that says is there

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
if we have system which corresponds to

00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a low-pass filter as i indicated here

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
with an impulse response a true fan

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and its it can be any approximation to a low pass filter and even an idea Lopez

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
filter

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
if we want to convert that to a high pass filter

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
we can't do that by generating a new system

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
whose impulse response is -1 to the end

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
times the impulse response the low-pass filter

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and this modulation

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
by -1 to the end will take the frequency response

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
this system and shifted by popeye

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
so that what's going on here at low frequencies

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
will now go on here at high frequency

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
this also says incidently dead if

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
we look at

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
the a and idea low-pass filter and i do. high pass filter

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and we choose the cutoff frequencies for comparison

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
for the band with the filter to be equal

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
since this ideal high pass filter is

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
this idea low-pass filter with the frequency response shifted

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
by popeye the modulation property tells us

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that in the time domain with that corresponds to

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is an impulse response multiplied five minus one to the S

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
so it says that the impulse response

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
love the high-pass filter or quently the inverse Fourier transform

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
love a high pass filter frequency response

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
is -1 to the end times the

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
impulse response to the low-pass filter that all follows for the modulation

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
property

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
now there's another way interesting and useful way

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
that modulation can be used to

00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
implement or convert from low pass filtering the high-pass filtering

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the modulation property tells us about multiplying the time domain is shifting

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
in the frequency domain

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and the example that we happen to pick said if you multiply

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
or modulate by -1 to the end that takes low frequencies and ship them to

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
high-frequency

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
what that tells us it as a practical and useful

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
notion is the following suppose we have a system

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
that we know is a low pass filter and it's a good luck this

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
how might we use it as a high pass filter

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
well one way to do it instead of shifting its frequency response

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
is to take the original signal

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
shift its low frequencies the high frequencies and its high frequencies the

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
low frequencies

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
by multiplying the input signal the original signal by -1 to the yen

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
process that with the low-pass filter we're now with sitting at the low

00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
frequencies with a high frequencies

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and then unscramble it all at the output

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
so that we put the frequencies back where they belong

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and I summarize that here let's suppose for example that

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
this system was a low-pass filter in and

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
so it low pass filters whatever comes into it

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
down below I indicate taking the input and first interchanging

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the high and low frequencies through modulation with -1 to the end

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
doing a low-pass filtering which and what sitting at the low frequencies here

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
with a high frequencies

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
this signal and then after the low-pass filtering

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
moving the frequencies back where they belong

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
by again modulating with -1 to the end

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and that in fact turns out to be a very useful

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
a very useful notion for

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
applying a fixed low pass filter

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
to do high-pass filtering and vice versa

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
okay no

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
what we've seen and what we've talked about

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
are the for a representation for

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
discrete-time signals and prior to that

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
continuous-time say and we've seen some very important similarities and

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
differences

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
and what I'd like to do is conclude

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
this lecture by summarizing

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
those various relationships kinda ball in one package

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and in fact drawing your attention to

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
both the similarities and differences and comparisons between

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
well let's begin in this summary

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
by first looking at the continuous-time

00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
for a series in a continuous time for a series

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
we have a periodic time function

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
exponentials

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and there are an infinite number these that are required to do the

00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
decomposition

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and we saw and analysis equation which tells us

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
how to get these four EA series coefficients

00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
through an integration on the original time

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and notice in this that what we have

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
is a continuous periodic timer function what we end up with

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
are in the frequency domain is a sequence a Fourier series coefficients

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
which in fact

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
is an infinite sequence namely requires all values

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
K in general

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
we had then generalized that to the continuous time for EA transform

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
an ineffective doing that what happened is that

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
the synthesis equation in the four EA

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
series became

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
integral relationship in the Fourier transform

00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and we now have a continuous-time

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
function which is no longer periodic this was for the a periodic case

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
represented as a linear combination up infinite has only close and frequency

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
complex exponentials with complex amplitudes given by Eq civil make it the

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Omega divided by two pi

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and we had of course the corresponding analysis equation the told us how to get

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
exe below me here

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
we have a continuous-time function which is a periodic

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and a continuous function of frequency

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
which is a periodic

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
the conceptual strategy in a discrete-time case

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
was very similar with

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
so differences resulting in the

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
relationships because of some inherent differences between

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
continuous-time and discrete-time we had

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
we began with the discrete-time for you series

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
corresponding to representing a periodic sequence

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
through a set of complex exponentials

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
where now we only required a finite number of the

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is because the fact that in fact with there are only a finite number of

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
harmonically related complex exponentials

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
that's an inherent property discrete-time complex exponentials

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and so we have a discrete

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
periodic type function and we ended up with a set of 48 series coefficients

00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
which of course are discrete as for a series coefficients are

00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and which periodically repeat because it the fact

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
that the Associated complex exponentials periodically

00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
repeat we then

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
used in arguments similar to the continuous-time case

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
for going for periodic time fortunes a periodic time

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
functions and we ended up with a relationship

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
describing representation for a periodic

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
discrete-time signals in which now

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the synthesis equation went from a summation to an integration

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
says the frequencies are now if it hasn't we close

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
involving frequencies only over to pry interval

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and for which the amplitude factor Xa bomb-maker

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
well the apathy factors X will make it the Omega divided by two pi

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and this term Mexico may go which is the 48 transform

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
is given by this some Asian

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and course involves all of the values affects a bit

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and so the important difference between the continuous-time and discrete-time

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
case kinda rose in part to the fact that discrete I miss discrete-time

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
continuous-time is continuous time

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and the fact the complex exponentials a periodic

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
in discrete-time the harmonically related ones periodically repeat

00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
whereas they don't in continuous time

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
now this among other things has an important consequence for duality

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and let's go back again and look at this equation

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
despair equations clearly their

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
is no duality between these two equations

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
this involves a summation this involves an integration

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and so in fact if

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
we make reference to to our the

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
their isn't the reality in the continuous-time

00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
for a series however

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
for the continuous-time for EA transform

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
we're talking about a periodic timer functions in a periodic frequency

00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
functions

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and in fact we look at these two equations we see very definitely duality

00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
in other words the time function effectively

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
is the Fourier transform the four th transport

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
little time reversal in there but basically that's the result

00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
and in fact we had exploited that duality property

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
when we talked about the continuous-time for EA transport

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
with the discrete-time Fourier series

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
we have a duality

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
indicated by the fact that we have a periodic time function

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and a sequence which is

00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
periodic in the frequency domain and in fact if you look at these two

00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
expressions

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
you see the duality very clearly and so

00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
ants the discrete-time Fourier series

00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that has to do our D and

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
finally the discrete-time Fourier transform loses the duality

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
because the fact among other things then in the time domain

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
things are inherently discrete whereas in the frequency domain

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
they are inherently continuous so in fact here

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
there is no do well

00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
okay now that says that there's a difference in the duality

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
continuous-time and discrete-time and there's one

00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
more very important peace to

00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
the duality relationship and we can see that

00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
first algebraically by comparing

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
the continuous-time for a series

00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and the discrete-time for EA transport

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
the continuous time for a series

00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
in the time domain is a periodic continuous function

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
in the frequency domain is in a periodic sequence

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
in the discrete-time case in

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
the time-domain we have

00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and a periodic sequence

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and in the frequency domain we have a function as a continuous variable

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
which we know is periodic and so in fact

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
we have in the time domain here a periodic sequence

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
in the frequency domain we have to continue with periodic function

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and in fact if you look at the relationship between these two

00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and and what we see in fact is

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
a duality between

00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
the continuous-time for EA series

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
and the discrete-time for EA transport

00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
one way of thinking if that is to kind of think

00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
this is a little bit at a time twister which you might want to get straightened

00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
out

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
slowly but

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
the Fourier transform a discrete-time is a periodic function of frequency

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
that periodic function has a forty a series representation

00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
what is this for you series what are the for a series coefficients

00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
that periodic function well in fact except for an issue with time reversal

00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
what it is

00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
is the original sequence for which that's the 48 Reitz

00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and that is the duality that I'm trying to emphasize

00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
you

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
okay well so what we see is that these

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
four sets a relationship all tied together in a whole variety of ways

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and we will be exploiting as the discussion goes on the

00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
interconnections a relationship that i've talked about

00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
also as we've talked about the 48 transform both continuous-time and

00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
discrete-time

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
two important properties that we focus on among

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
many other properties by the convolution property in the modulation property

00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
we've also shown that the convolution property

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
the so very important concept

00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
namely filtering the modulation property leads to an

00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
an important con- concept namely modulation

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
we've also very briefly indicated

00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that how these properties

00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and how these concepts have practical implications

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
in the next several lectures will focus and more specifically

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
first on filtering and then on modulation

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and as we'll see the filtering and modulation concept

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
form really the cornerstone %uh many many

00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
signal processing ideas thank you
