the

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,950 
over the last several lectures we
developed the for a representation for

14
00:00:60,280 --> 00:01:03,930 
and continuous-time signals what i'd

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,750 
now like to do is develop a similar
representation for discrete-time

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,810 
and let me begin a discussion by

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,180 
reminding you up what are basic
motivation was the idea

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,630 
is that what we wanted to do was exploit
the properties

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,140 
love linearity in time and variance for
linear time-invariant systems

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,330 
so and in the case love

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,869 
linear time-invariant systems the

22
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,430 
basic idea was to consider

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,130 
decomposing the input as a linear
combination

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,399 
love basic inputs and then

25
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,970 
because I've Lenny arity the output
could be expressed as

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,340 
a linear combination of corresponding
outputs where

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,780 
saw I serve I is the output

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,280 
due to fee survive so

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,200 
basically what we attempted to do was
decompose the input

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,729 
and then reconstruct the output through

31
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,830 
a linear combination all the outputs to
those basic inputs

32
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,700 
we then focused on the notion

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,840 
love choosing the basic inputs

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,400 
with two criterion mine one was

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760 
to choose them so that a broad class
signals

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,640 
could be constructed out over those
basic inputs

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,000 
and the second was to choose the basic
inputs

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,660 
so that the response to those was easy
to compute

39
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,150 
and as you recall one representation
that we ended up with

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,060 
with those basic criteria in mind:

41
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,150 
was the representation through
convolution

42
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,600 
and then in beginning the discussion
love the for a representation of

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280 
continuous-time signals

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,060 
we chose as another said a basic inputs

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,489 
complex exponentials so

46
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,580 
for continuous-time we chose

47
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,780 
a set love basic inputs which were
complex exponential

48
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,340 
the motivation there was the fact that

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,420 
the complex exponentials have we
referred to as

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,700 
the I can function property namely

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,870 
if we put complex exponentials into our
continuous-time systems

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,610 
than the output is a complex exponential

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,030 
love the same form with

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,379 
only a change in complex amplitude

55
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,910 
and that change in complex amplitude is

56
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,670 
what we referred to as the

57
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,569 
frequency response %uh the system

58
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,620 
and also by the way as it developed
later

59
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,330 
that frequency response as you should
now recognize from this expression

60
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,659 
is in fact the 48 transform the
continuous-time for EA transform

61
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,180 
all the system impulse response and

62
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,799 
the notion all decomposing a signal as a
linear combination of both these complex

63
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,909 
exponentials

64
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,190 
is what the first the forty a series

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,099 
representation and then later the
Fourier transform representation

66
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,180 
corresponded to

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,380 
and finally to remind you

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,200 
love one additional point the fact is
that because the eigenfunction property

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,280 
the response

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,669 
once we decompose the input as a linear
combination

71
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,880 
complex exponentials the response to
that when your combination

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,200 
is straightforward to compute once we
know the frequency response

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,630 
because if the eigenfunction property
now

74
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,710 
basically the same strategy

75
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,640 
and many of the same ideas work in
discrete-time

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,400 
paralleling almost exactly what happened
in continuous-time

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,150 
so the similarities between
discrete-time and continuous-time

78
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,250 
are very strong although as we'll see
there are a number

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,900 
a differences and it's important

80
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,100 
as we go through the discussion to
illuminate

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,150 
not only the similarities but obviously
also the differences

82
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,669 
well let's begin with the I can function
property

83
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,600 
and let me just say that just as in
continuous-time

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,229 
if we consider said a basic signals

85
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,419 
which are complex exponentials

86
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,389 
then discrete-time linear time-invariant
systems

87
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,080 
have the I can function property namely

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,210 
if we put a complex exponential into the
system

89
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,360 
the response is a complex exponential

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560 
at the same complex frequency and

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,280 
simply multiplied by inappropriate

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,660 
complex factor or constant

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,039 
and just as we did in

94
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,500 
continuous-time we will be

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,970 
referring to this complex constant which
is a function

96
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,919 
of course the frequency other complex
exponential input

97
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,430 
will be referring to this as the
frequency response

98
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,449 
and although it's not particularly
evident at this point

99
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,550 
as the discussion develops through this
lecture what in fact will happen

100
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,669 
is very much paralleling

101
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,120 
continuous-time this particular
expression

102
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,210 
in fact will correspond

103
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,460 
to what will refer to as the

104
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,110 
for EA transform the discrete-time
Fourier transform

105
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,729 
up the system impulse response so there
of course there's a very strong parallel

106
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,280 
between continuous-time and
discrete-time

107
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,850 
now just as we did in continuous-time

108
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,949 
let's begin a discussion by

109
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,240 
first concentrating on periodic the
representation through complex

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,389 
exponentials

111
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,130 
love periodic sequences and then

112
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,280 
will generalize that discussion to the
representation

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,569 
Ave periodic signals so

114
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,639 
let's consider furs a periodic signal

115
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,919 
or in general signals which are periodic

116
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,419 
period to notify capital and and then

117
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,780 
course the fundamental frequency is

118
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,599 
to pie divided by capital

119
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,650 
now we can consider exponentials

120
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,370 
which have this as a fundamental
frequency

121
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,410 
war which are harmonics that

122
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,860 
and that would correspond to the class
of complex exponentials

123
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,310 
the form you to the JK Omega 0n

124
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,360 
so these complex exponentials then

125
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,979 
as k varies are complex exponentials

126
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,509 
that are harmonically related with

127
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,440 
all of which our periodic with the same
period

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120 
capital and although the fundamental
period

129
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,849 
is different for each of these each of
them being related by

130
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,120 
an integer amount

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,470 
now again just as we did in continuous
time we can consider

132
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,690 
attempting to build our periodic signal
I have a linear combination

133
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,839 
love these and so we consider

134
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,560 
a periodic signal which is

135
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,720 
a weighted sum all these

136
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,770 
me complex exponentials and

137
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,480 
of course this periodic signal this is a
periodic signal as can be

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,170 
verified in more or less in a
straightforward way by substitution

139
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,010 
and of course one of the things that
will want to address shortly

140
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,089 
is how broad a classic signals again can
be represented

141
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,500 
by this psalm and another question
obviously will be

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,870 
how do we determine the coefficients a
suitcase

143
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,930 
however in before we do that let me

144
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,930 
focus on an important distinction

145
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,459 
between continuous-time and
discrete-time

146
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:30,410 
in the context of these complex
exponentials and this representation

147
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,149 
when we talked about complex
exponentials and sinusoids

148
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,040 
early in the cores one up the difference
is that we saw between continuous-time

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,830 
and discrete-time

150
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,430 
is dead in continuous-time as we very

151
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,140 
in the frequency variable we see
different complex exponentials

152
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,580 
as Omega berries whereas in
discrete-time

153
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,760 
we saw in fact dead there was a period
this city

154
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720 
or said another way it's straightforward
to verify

155
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,040 
that if we think I love this

156
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,130 
class a complex exponentials day

157
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,830 
in fact if we consider burying

158
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,480 
K by an ink to it

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,560 
capital and where capital and is the
period

160
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,670 
all the fundamental

161
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,779 
complex exponential then in fact

162
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,920 
if we replace K by K plus capital and

163
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,779 
we'll see exactly the same complex
exponentials over again

164
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,250 
now what does that say what it says is
that if I consider this class of complex

165
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,940 
exponentials

166
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,829 
SK varies from zero

167
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,790 
through capital N -1 we've seen

168
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,060 
we will see all of the ones that there
are two see

169
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,560 
there aren't any more and so in fact

170
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,649 
if we can build excessive and

171
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,140 
I have this linear combination then

172
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,720 
we better be able to do it as k varies

173
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,500 
from 0

174
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,459 
up to and -1 because

175
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,010 
beyond that will simply see the same
complex s

176
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,040 
exponentials over again so for example

177
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,360 
if k takes on the value capital and

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,930 
that will be exactly the same complex
exponential

179
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,329 
as if KZ 0

180
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,290 
so in fact this some ranges

181
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,440 
only over capital in above the distinct
complex exponentials

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,070 
let's say for example from 0 to capital
and -1

183
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,920 
although in fact since these complex
exponentials repeat

184
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,209 
in K I could actually consider instead
have

185
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,430 
from 0 to N -1 I could consider from one

186
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,800 
and or from to too and plus one or
whatever

187
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,829 
or said another way in this
representation

188
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,089 
I could alternatively shoes K

189
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,350 
outside this range thinking

190
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,440 
0 these coefficients simply as
periodically repeating in K

191
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,670 
because if the fact that these complex
exponentials

192
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,480 
periodically repeating K so in fact

193
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,450 
in place if this expression it will be
comin in writing the forty a series

194
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,800 
expression

195
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,470 
to write it as i've indicated here where
the implication is

196
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,620 
that these Fourier coefficients

197
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,310 
periodically repeated as K continues to
rip

198
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,380 
to repeat outside the interval from 0 to
N -1

199
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,380 
and so this notation in fact says

200
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,620 
at what we're going to use are

201
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,680 
is K ranging over one period

202
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,470 
love this periodic sequence which is the
forty a series called

203
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,310 
visions okay so

204
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,329 
the expression that we have been for the
forty a series

205
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:18,209 
I've repeated here and the implication
now is that

206
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,600 
the AC K's are periodic they
periodically repeat because of course

207
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,160 
these exponentials periodically repeated

208
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,490 
this indicates there we only use them
over one period

209
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,910 
and now we can inquire as to how

210
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,100 
we determine the coefficients aces K

211
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,500 
well we can formally go through this
much as we did in

212
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,709 
the continuous-time case in and 0

213
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,410 
we do in fact do that in the text which
involves substituting some

214
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,800 
sums in a change in yours summation
cetera

215
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,399 
but let me a draw your attention to the
fact that

216
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,540 
this in fact can be thought I love

217
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,230 
as capital in equations in capital and
unknowns

218
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,120 
in other words we know x7 over a period

219
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,269 
and so we know what the left hand side
if this is for capital and bad news

220
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,079 
and we'd like to determine these
constant sese K

221
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,149 
well it turns out that their is a nice
convening in closed form expression for

222
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,029 
that

223
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,089 
and in fact if we evaluate the
closed-form expression

224
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,660 
through any variety of algebraic
manipulations

225
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,940 
we end up then with the

226
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,430 
analysis equation and the analysis
equation

227
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,230 
which tells us how to get the
coefficients AC K

228
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,329 
from excessive and is what I've

229
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,740 
indicated here and

230
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,810 
so this tells us how for Maxim and

231
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,180 
to get the AC K's and of course the
first equation

232
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,589 
tells us how x7 is built up by the VA's

233
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,199 
K's notice incidently that

234
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,050 
there is a strong to our the between
these two equations

235
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,160 
and that's a duality that will return to

236
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,389 
actually toward the end of the next
lecture now

237
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,589 
there is a real difference between the
way those equations look

238
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,550 
and the way the continuous-time forty a
series look

239
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,060 
in a continuous-time case let me remind
you

240
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,110 
that it required

241
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,620 
an infinite number of coefficients to
build up this continuous-time

242
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,850 
function and so this was not simply a
matter

243
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,449 
of identifying how to invert capital and

244
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:44,279 
were a finite number of equations in a
finite number upon owns

245
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,709 
and the analysis equation was

246
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:53,040 
and integration as opposed to the
synthesis equation

247
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,180 
which is a summation so

248
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,310 
their is a real difference there between

249
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,000 
the continuous-time and discrete-time
cases and a difference

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,180 
arises to a large extent because

251
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,060 
all this notion that in discrete-time
the complex exponentials

252
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,220 
are periodic in

253
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,810 
their frequency so we have been to
summarize

254
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,829 
the synthesis equation and the analysis
equation

255
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:27,209 
for the discrete-time for a series

256
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:32,269 
again x7 are original signals periodic

257
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:35,399 
and of course the complex exponentials

258
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,790 
involve the periodic their periodic
obviously in an

259
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,230 
by it in contrast the continuous-time
these repeat

260
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,920 
in K in other words as k Omega 0

261
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,509 
goes outside arrange that covers a 25
interval

262
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:56,899 
and because if that we're imposing

263
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:02,829 
in a sense the interpretation that the
AC Kesar likewise the periodic sequence

264
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:05,980 
and in fact we look at the analysis
equation

265
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,399 
as we let K very

266
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,540 
outside the range from 0 to N -1

267
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,030 
what you can easily verified by
substitution in here

268
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,030 
is that this sequence will in fact
periodically repeat

269
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,220 
so to underscore the difference between
the continuous-time and discrete-time

270
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,510 
cases

271
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,310 
we have this periodicity in the time
domain

272
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:38,220 
and that's a periodicity dad is of
course true in discrete-time

273
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,780 
and it's also true in continuous-time

274
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,200 
if we replace the integer variable

275
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,820 
by the discrete-time time variable

276
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,809 
and we also indiscreet I'm have this
periodicity

277
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,679 
in krak Omega 0 and correspondingly

278
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,820 
a periodicity in the four EA
coefficients

279
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,010 
and bad is center properties

280
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,470 
dat does not happen

281
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,160 
in continuous-time and is bad

282
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,620 
there essentially leads to all of the
important differences between

283
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,049 
discrete-time Fourier representations
and in continuous-time

284
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,260 
Korea representation

285
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,650 
now just quickly let me draw your
attention to the issue

286
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:35,460 
love convergence and when a sequence can
and can't be represented at cetera

287
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,260 
a recall that in the continuous-time
case

288
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,650 
we focused on convergence in the context
either

289
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,880 
conditions which are referred to as
where the group believe the

290
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,530 
or another set of conditions which were
the the Ridgeway conditions

291
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,880 
and there was this issue about when the
signal doesn't doesn't convergent

292
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,860 
discontinuities

293
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,710 
center let me just simply draw your
attention to the fact

294
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,090 
there in the discrete-time case

295
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,650 
what we have is the representation of
the periodic signal

296
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,530 
as Assam all a finite number

297
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,830 
turns this represents capital and
equations in capital and unknowns

298
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,460 
if we consider the partial some namely
taking

299
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,919 
a smaller number turns then simply what
happens

300
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,730 
is as the number of turns increases

301
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,990 
to the finite number required to
represent

302
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,250 
ex-dividend we simply end up with

303
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,770 
the partial some representing the fun
and Lightsey

304
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,150 
were all that boils down to is the
statement

305
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,240 
that in discrete-time there really are

306
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,650 
no convergence issues as they were in
continues time

307
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,549 
okay well let's look at an example love
the four EA

308
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,780 
series representation for a particular
signal

309
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,429 
and the one that I think here is a
simple one

310
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,299 
namely a constant a

311
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,429 
are signed term and a cosine term

312
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,270 
now for this particular example we can
expand this out

313
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,630 
directly in terms of complex
exponentials

314
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,809 
and essentially recognize this as a
somewhat complex exponentials

315
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,960 
its examined in more detail

316
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,380 
in example 5.2 in attacks

317
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,679 
and if we looked at the for a series
coefficients we can either look

318
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,160 
at it in terms of real and imaginary
parts are magnitude and angle

319
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,120 
on the left side here I have the real
part of the 48 coefficients

320
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,860 
and let me draw your attention to the
fact

321
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,100 
their I've drawn yes

322
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,919 
to specifically illuminate the
periodicity

323
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,460 
other for a series coefficients in with
a period of capital and so here are the

324
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,240 
Fourier coefficients

325
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,080 
are and in fact its this line that
represents the DCR constant term

326
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520 
and these two lines represent the

327
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,179 
co-signed term and of course this

328
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,179 
these are the three turns that are
required or equivalent leave this one

329
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:25,860 
this one

330
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,409 
and this one and then because the period
this city

331
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,880 
the for a series coefficients this
simply periodically repeats

332
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,950 
so here is the real part and below it I
show

333
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,090 
the imaginary part and

334
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,150 
in the imaginary part incidently let me

335
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,460 
draw your attention to the fact dead its

336
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,809 
this term and this term

337
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,360 
there represent in the imaginary part
that represent the sinusoid

338
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,150 
whereas its the symmetric turns the real
part

339
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,120 
the represent the cosine okay let's

340
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,600 
in look at another example

341
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,039 
this is another example from the tax and
one

342
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,419 
that will be making frequent reference
to

343
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,970 
in this particular lecture

344
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,110 
and what it is is

345
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,770 
a square wave and

346
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,580 
I've express the for a series
coefficients which are out algebraically

347
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,309 
developed in attacks

348
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,809 
I've expressed the for a series
coefficients as

349
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,960 
samples all an envelope

350
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,580 
function and so I've expressed that as
samples if this

351
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,150 
particular function which is referred to
as a sign

352
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,549 
enacts over sin x function and let me
just compare it

353
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,860 
to a continuous-time example which is
the

354
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,909 
continuous-time square wave

355
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,120 
where with the continuous times square
wave

356
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,720 
the form or the for a series
coefficients

357
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,030 
was as samples love what we refer to

358
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,860 
as a sin x over expunge

359
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,960 
now the sin NX

360
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,220 
over sin x function which is the
envelope for the for a series

361
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,340 
coefficients

362
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,740 
for the discrete-time periodic square
wave

363
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,480 
plays the role and we'll see it very
often in discrete-time

364
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,780 
that sin x over exercise in
continuous-time

365
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,230 
and in fact we should understand right
from the beginning

366
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,090 
that the sin x over extend below
couldn't possibly be

367
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,169 
the envelope the discrete-time for a
series coefficients

368
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,650 
and one obvious reason is dead

369
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,360 
it is not periodic what we require of
course

370
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,250 
from the discussion I just going through
is periodicity

371
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,020 
are the coefficients and consequently
also periodicity of the envelope

372
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,250 
in the discrete-time case so once again
if we look back

373
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,679 
at the algebraic expression that I have

374
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,429 
it samples about the sign an X over sin
x

375
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:12,130 
function dead represent the for a series
coefficients

376
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,159 
love this periodic square way

377
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,610 
now in the representation in

378
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,309 
the continuous-time case we

379
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:29,080 
essentially head use the concept of an
envelope

380
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,130 
to represent the for a series
coefficients

381
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,840 
and the notion that the for a series
coefficients were samples

382
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,919 
up an envelope and that is said the same
notion

383
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,740 
there will be using in discrete-time so

384
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,820 
again for this square wave example

385
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,289 
then what we have is an envelope

386
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,360 
function the sign acts

387
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,750 
over sin x envelope function for

388
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,720 
a particular value of the period here
indicated with a period

389
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,929 
love 10 samples these

390
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:07,950 
samples at this envelope function with
then

391
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,289 
represent the for a series coefficients

392
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:14,549 
if we increased

393
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,679 
the period then

394
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,690 
we would simply have a finer spacing

395
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,789 
on the samples are the envelope function

396
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,279 
to get the 40 a series coefficients and

397
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,779 
in likewise if we increase the period
still further

398
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:37,279 
what we would have is an even finer
space

399
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,750 
so actually as the period increases
recall we use this in the in

400
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,779 
continuous-time also

401
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:48,480 
as the period increases we can view the
for a series coefficients

402
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,039 
samples of an envelope and as the period
increases

403
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,429 
the sample spacing gets finer and finer

404
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,500 
and in fact as the period goes

405
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,330 
of essentially to infinity the samples
of the envelope

406
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,500 
in effect become the anvil and recall
also

407
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,870 
that this was essentially the trip that
we use

408
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,039 
in continuous-time to allow us

409
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,659 
to develop or utilize the 48 series

410
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,520 
to provide a representation %uh a
periodic signals

411
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,409 
as a linear combination of complex
exponentials

412
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:30,140 
in particular what we did in

413
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,630 
the continuous-time case

414
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,690 
when we head and a periodic signal

415
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,659 
was to consider constructing a periodic
signal

416
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,120 
for which be a periodic signal was one
period

417
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,260 
and then we developed the notion there
since

418
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,169 
the periodic signal has a forty eight
series

419
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,169 
and since as the period

420
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,850 
the periodic signal increases n goes to
infinity

421
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,980 
the periodic signal represents the a
periodic signal

422
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,039 
then essentially the 48 series

423
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,620 
provides us with the representation now

424
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,429 
we can do exactly the same thing in the
discrete-time case

425
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,000 
the statement is exactly the same except
dead in a discrete-time case

426
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,500 
instead of see as the independent
variable

427
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,600 
we simply make exactly the same
statement

428
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,210 
but with are discrete-time variable

429
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,110 
and so the basic notion then in
representing

430
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:41,630 
a discrete-time a periodic signal

431
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,260 
is to first construct

432
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,380 
a periodic signal here we have the

433
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,000 
a periodic signal reconstruct a periodic
signal

434
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,860 
by simply periodically replicating the a
periodic signal

435
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,909 
the periodic signal in the a periodic
signal are identical

436
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,399 
for one period and as

437
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,409 
the period goes off to infinity

438
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:15,370 
it's the forty a series representation
of the periodic signal

439
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,669 
that provides a representation all

440
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,210 
the a periodic signal again

441
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,279 
to returned to the example

442
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,700 
that we

443
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,880 
have been kinda working through this
lecture namely the periodic square wave

444
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,200 
if we have in a periodic signal which is
a rectangle

445
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,470 
and reconstruct the periodic signal

446
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,320 
and now we consider letting this period
increase to infinity

447
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,440 
we would first have this set of samples
of the envelope

448
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,010 
as the period increases we would
decrease the sample spacing to this set

449
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,799 
of samples

450
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,580 
as the period increases further it would
be

451
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,539 
this set of samples and as the period
goes off to infinity

452
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,850 
its every point on the envelope in fact

453
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,779 
what the representation up the a
periodic signal

454
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:18,510 
is is the anvil

455
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,779 
okay well so that's the basic notion
it's no different than what we did

456
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:26,309 
in the continuous-time case and

457
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:29,360 
mathematically it develops in

458
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,760 
very much the same way as in the
continuous-time

459
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,520 
case specifically

460
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,950 
here is our representation

461
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,159 
through the forty a series all the

462
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,899 
here here's a representation through the
envelope function

463
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,779 
and this is the 48 series synthesis
equation where

464
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,370 
equation the equation below tells us

465
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,770 
how we'd get these for EA coefficients

466
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,090 
or the envelope from accident

467
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,320 
now extolled event is the periodic
signal and we know that

468
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,130 
over one period which is the only
interval over which we use it

469
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,100 
in fact this is identical to the a
periodic signal

470
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,940 
its own fact we can rewrite this
equation

471
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,049 
simply by substituting instead effect
told The

472
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,299 
the original a periodic signal and now

473
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:34,730 
we can use infinite limits on this some
and

474
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,149 
what we would want to examine
mathematically is

475
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,480 
what happens to the top equation

476
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,080 
as to the top equation as we let the
period

477
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,010 
go off to infinity and what happens is

478
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,450 
exactly identical mathematically to
continuous-time

479
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,200 
I won't the labor the details
essentially

480
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,850 
its this some that goes to an integral

481
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,200 
Omega 0 which is the fundamental
frequency is going

482
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,630 
toward zero in fact becomes the
differential in the integral

483
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,970 
and in the second equation of course
this then becomes excessive Omega

484
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,450 
and as n goes to infinity then

485
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,789 
what the for a series becomes is the 48
transform

486
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:25,809 
as summarized by the bottom to

487
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,750 
equations so although

488
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,029 
there are is a little bit mathematical

489
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,200 
trickery year but I called trickery but
subtlety

490
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,390 
to be tracked through in detail the
important conceptual thing to think

491
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,020 
about

492
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,309 
is this notion dead

493
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,260 
we take the a periodic signal for
periodic signal let the period go off to

494
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,100 
infinity

495
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,330 
which case the forty a series
coefficients became these

496
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,690 
envelope function and incidently
mathematically

497
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,760 
one of the sons ends up going to an
integral

498
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,909 
so what we have then is

499
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:07,940 
the discrete-time for EA transform

500
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,010 
which is a representation all

501
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,450 
and a periodic signal and we have

502
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,510 
the synthesis equation which I show as
the top equation honest

503
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,710 
transparency and this

504
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,440 
is the integral that the four East
series

505
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,929 
synthesis equation went to as the period
when off to infinity

506
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:36,360 
and we have the corresponding analysis
equation

507
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,299 
which is shown below where this tells us
the 48 transform

508
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,919 
in effect the envelope all the for a
series coefficients

509
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,340 
love that periodic signal in and here

510
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,309 
represented interns love the a periodic
signal

511
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:58,860 
okay so we have the analysis equation
synthesis equation

512
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,600 
there are a number of things to focus

513
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,080 
on as you look at this and we'll talk
about so its properties

514
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,179 
actually in the next lecture by it sold
them the

515
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,820 
points the I'd like you to think about a
focus on

516
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,880 
the fact that now there

517
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,480 
is somewhat have an imbalance or lack of
duality between the time-domain and

518
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,929 
frequency-domain

519
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:25,529 
x seven witches are a periodic signal is
a course

520
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:29,210 
discrete its Fourier transform

521
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,470 
Xserve Omega is a function love a
continuous variable

522
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,539 
Omega is a continuous variable that that

523
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:41,529 
and that is essentially what represents
the envelope

524
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:44,880 
also in the time domain x7 is

525
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,409 
a periodic its not a periodic function

526
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:54,240 
however in the frequency domain remember
that the for a series coefficients were

527
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,649 
always periodic

528
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:59,750 
well this envelope function then is also
periodic

529
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,860 
with a period in omega up to par i

530
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,129 
what's again the reason for the
periodicity it all stems back to the

531
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:08,870 
fact

532
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,529 
there when we talk about complex
exponentials

533
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:16,909 
and recall back to the early lectures in
discrete-time

534
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,279 
as the frequency variable covers a range

535
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:25,970 
all to parlay when you proceed past that
range

536
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,490 
you simply see the same complex
exponentials over and over again

537
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,620 
and so obviously anything that we do
with them would have to be periodic

538
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,060 
in that frequency variable alright
notation Lee

539
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,470 
and will again represent the

540
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,310 
discrete-time Fourier transform here as
i indicate here

541
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,679 
and sense is a complex function of
frequency

542
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,350 
may on occasion want to either
represented

543
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,550 
in rectangular form as i indicated this
equation

544
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,000 
or in polar for as i indicate in this
equation

545
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,050 
all right let's and look at an example

546
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,089 
and of course one example that

547
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,710 
we can look at is the one that has kind
of been tracking this

548
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,720 
through this lecture which is the
example

549
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,839 
love a rectangle now

550
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,510 
the rectangle if we refer back to our

551
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,490 
argument love how we get a for a
representation for a periodic signal

552
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,750 
we would form a periodic signal where
this is repeated

553
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,310 
and thats are square wave example as the
period goes to infinity

554
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,359 
the forty a transformer this is
represented by the envelope

555
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,730 
all those for a series coefficients and
that was

556
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,839 
are sign an X over sin x function

557
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,320 
which in this particular case for these
particular numbers

558
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,900 
is sin 5 Omega over to

559
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,000 
divided by sign Omega over to

560
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,890 
and notice of course as we would expect

561
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,329 
that notice that this is a

562
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,589 
periodic function all the frequency
variable Omega

563
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:13,980 
repeating of course with a period up to
par

564
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,710 
whereas in the time domain the function
was not

565
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,869 
a periodic function it's a period

566
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:25,930 
now let's look at another example

567
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,990 
in let's look at example

568
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,040 
which is another signal that has

569
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,859 
kinda popped its head up from time to
time as the lectures have gone along

570
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:42,160 
signal which is another a periodic
signal which is a decaying exponential

571
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,450 
of this form with the

572
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:50,020 
factor a chosen between 0&1

573
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,390 
and you can workout the algebra

574
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,550 
at your leisure basically if we
substituted to the four EA

575
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,930 
transform analysis equation its

576
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,400 
this summer we evaluate because we have
a unit step here

577
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,150 
which shots this of for and less than
zero

578
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,990 
we can change the limits on the some
this then corresponds

579
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,540 
to the some over an infinite number
turns

580
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,630 
geometric series and that as we've seen
before

581
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,700 
is one divided by one minus a

582
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,280 
you to the minus jail make so

583
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,770 
let's look at what that looks like

584
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,810 
here him then we have again

585
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,240 
the expression in the time domain

586
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,460 
and the expression in the frequency
domain

587
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,770 
and lets in particular focus I N what
the magnitude of the Fourier transform

588
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,190 
looks like

589
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,930 
its as we show here

590
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,150 
and for the particular values

591
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,530 
Ave that I picked namely between 0&1

592
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,540 
its larger at the origin then it is upon
I

593
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,320 
and then of course it is periodic

594
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,329 
and the periodicity is inherent in the
Fourier transform in discrete-time

595
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:18,040 
so we really might only need to look at
this either from minus

596
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,339 
fired upon by or from 0 to 2pi

597
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:25,660 
the periodicity of course would imply
what the rest at this is for other

598
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,150 
values have or make it

599
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,460 
let me also draw your attention at war
on it

600
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,589 
the fact dead observed at if

601
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,849 
a were in fact negative then

602
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,960 
this value would be less than this value

603
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,130 
and in fact for a negative

604
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,579 
the magnitude the frequency response
would look like this except shifted

605
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,630 
by an amount in omega equal the pie

606
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,690 
and this example will come up

607
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:02,280 
and play an important role in our
discussion next time

608
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,859 
so try to keep it in mind in fact work
it out more carefully between

609
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:10,839 
now and next time and also if you have a
chance

610
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:14,430 
focus on this issue love how it looks

611
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,380 
with a positive is compared with a
negative

612
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,310 
okay now we developed the 48 transform

613
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:29,589 
by beginning with the forty a series we
did that in continuous time also

614
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,160 
but I'd like to do now just as we did in
continuous-time

615
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,400 
is now absorb the forty a series

616
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,670 
within the broader framework above the
40 a transport

617
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:47,140 
and there are two relationships between
the forty a series the Fourier transform

618
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,390 
which are identical to relationships
that we had

619
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,510 
in the continuous-time case

620
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,750 
let me remind you dead in

621
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,010 
continuous-time we head

622
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:08,010 
the statement there if we have a
periodic signal

623
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,589 
that in fact the forty a series
coefficients that periodic signal

624
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:16,750 
is proportional to

625
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,500 
the two samples of the Fourier transform

626
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,040 
all one period well

627
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,650 
in fact thats let me remind you flows

628
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,790 
easily from all other things that we've
built up

629
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,640 
so far because of the fact that the for
a transformer sexually

630
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,660 
by definition love the way we developed
it

631
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,960 
is what we get as

632
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,910 
the forty-a series coefficients

633
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:51,290 
as we focus on one period and then let
the period go off to infinity

634
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:56,140 
well thats looking at one period before
a transformer that then

635
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,710 
is the envelope above the 40 a series
coefficients

636
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,480 
and so in continuous-time we have

637
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,450 
this relationship and in discrete-time

638
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,720 
we have precisely the same relationship

639
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,910 
except that here we're talking about

640
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,790 
an integer variable and as opposed to
the continuous variable and a period of

641
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,640 
capital and

642
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,710 
as opposed to a period

643
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:30,089 
love t0 okay so

644
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:33,640 
once again if we returned to

645
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,470 
our example

646
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,500 
if or Fri return to a periodic signal

647
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,079 
we have a periodic signal and we
consider

648
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,349 
the for EA transform love

649
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:52,230 
one period the for a series coefficients

650
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,240 
this periodic signal are in fact

651
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,630 
samples as stated

652
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,069 
mathematically in the bottom equation
samples

653
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:05,990 
love the four EA transform all

654
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:11,369 
one period so XO makers the for a
transformer one period

655
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:15,589 
a suitcase at a4e series coefficients at
the periodic signal

656
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:20,829 
and this relationship simply says their
related except for a scale factor

657
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:26,069 
through samples along the frequency axis

658
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:31,150 
and and the chorus we saw this

659
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,180 
in the context all our

660
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,650 
square wave example in a square wave

661
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,079 
example we have a periodic signal

662
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,940 
which is a periodic square wave

663
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,319 
and the for EA transform

664
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:53,329 
a one period in fact represents

665
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:57,390 
the on below and here we have the
envelope function

666
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,760 
represents the envelope or the forty a
series coefficients

667
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,640 
and the for a series coefficients are
samples

668
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,000 
so what we have been is

669
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,359 
a relationship back to before a series
coefficients from the Fourier transform

670
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,900 
that tells us that for periodic signal
now

671
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,970 
the periodic signal the for a series
coefficients

672
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,640 
are related are samples of the Fourier
transform

673
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,760 
one period now

674
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,050 
finally to kinda bring things back in a
circle

675
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,349 
and exactly identical to what we did it
in the continuous-time

676
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,680 
case we can finally absorber

677
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,109 
the 48 series indiscreet

678
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:50,630 
time we can absorb it into the framework

679
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,480 
all the four EA transport now

680
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,650 
remember or recall how we did at when

681
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,280 
re tried to do a similar sort of thing

682
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,020 
in continuous-time in continuous-time

683
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,720 
what we essentially did is

684
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,690 
to develop that more less by definition

685
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,420 
we have occurred we have a periodic
signal

686
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,650 
the periodic signal is represented
through 48 series

687
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,490 
in forty a series coefficients
essentially

688
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:30,220 
when I pointed out at that time was that
if we define

689
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,619 
and take it as a definition before a
transformer the periodic signal

690
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,800 
as an impulse train where the amplitudes
at the impulses are proportional

691
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,920 
to the forty a series coefficients

692
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,060 
if we take an impulse train
representation

693
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,050 
and simply plug it in

694
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,599 
to the for EA

695
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,589 
transform synthesis equation what we end
up with

696
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:05,099 
is the for you see recent this equation

697
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,589 
so in continuous-time

698
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:12,359 
we bad done

699
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,400 
we had used this definition I love

700
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,819 
the discrete-time up the continuous-time

701
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,900 
for EA transform other periodic signal

702
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,550 
and again in discrete-time it's simply a
matter

703
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,319 
love using exactly the same expression

704
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,369 
and using instead the appropriate

705
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,630 
variables related to discrete-time
rather than the variables related to

706
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,069 
continuous-time

707
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:43,260 
so in discrete-time if we have a
periodic signal

708
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,560 
the Fourier transform that periodic
signal

709
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,660 
is defined as an impulse train where the

710
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,720 
amplitudes up the impulses

711
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,670 
are proportional to the forty a series
coefficients

712
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,099 
if this expression is substituted into
the synthesis equation

713
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,780 
for the 48 transform we will simply that
will simply then reduced to

714
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,440 
this synthesis equation for the forty a
series

715
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,960 
so wants more returning to

716
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,349 
our example which is the square wave
example that we carry through these

717
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:20,410 
lectures

718
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,050 
or through this lecture we can see that

719
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:28,440 
really what we're talking about really
is a notational change

720
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,480 
here is the four EA here is the periodic
signal

721
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,560 
and below it are the forty a series

722
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,319 
coefficients where I've removed the
envelope function just indicate

723
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:46,849 
the airport to the coefficients index of
course on the coefficient number

724
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:50,730 
and so this represents a bar graph and

725
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,420 
if instead of talking about the for a
series coefficients

726
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,130 
what I want to talk about are the

727
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,450 
is the four EA transform the Fourier
transform

728
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,300 
in essence corresponds to simply
redrawing mad

729
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,670 
using impulses and using

730
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,750 
an axis that is essentially

731
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,260 
index on the fundamental frequency Omega
0

732
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,859 
rather than on the four EA series
coefficient number

733
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:24,170 
K

734
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,470 
okay in so

735
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,770 
to summarize what we've done

736
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,099 
is to pretty much parallel

737
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:39,930 
are somewhat more quickly the kind of
development that we went through

738
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,069 
for continuous-time representation
through complex exponentials

739
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,640 
parallel that for the discrete-time case

740
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,480 
and pretty much the conceptual
underpinnings that the development are

741
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,010 
identical

742
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,990 
in discrete-time and in continuous time

743
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,420 
we saw there'd their are

744
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,910 
some major differences are important
differences between continuous-time and

745
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,440 
discrete-time

746
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,500 
I'm and the difference essentially

747
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,819 
relates to two aspect one aspect is the
fact that

748
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:22,010 
in discrete-time we have a discrete
representation in the time domain

749
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,050 
whereas the independent variable in the
frequency domain

750
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,230 
is a continuous variable whereas in
continuous-time

751
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,890 
for the Fourier transform we had duality
between the time-domain and

752
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,339 
frequency-domain

753
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:39,650 
the other very important difference tied
back to the difference between complex

754
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,290 
exponentials continuous-time and
discrete-time

755
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,349 
in continuous-time complex exponentials
as you very the frequency

756
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:51,359 
generate distinct

757
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,290 
time functions in discrete-time as you
very the frequency

758
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,250 
once you've covered a frequency interval
to pie

759
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,930 
then you've seen all the ones there are
two see there are no more

760
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,520 
in this in a fact imposes a periodicity

761
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,170 
on the 48 domain representation of
discrete-time signals

762
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:17,510 
and those so those differences and of
course lots the similarities

763
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,380 
will surface both as we use this
representation

764
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,359 
and as we develop for the property

765
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,359 
in the next lecture what will do is

766
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,800 
to focus and again on the Fourier
transform the discrete-time Fourier

767
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,599 
transform

768
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,990 
develop or eliminate so love the
property serv the trip or a transform

769
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,510 
and then see how these properties can be
used

770
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,530 
for a number of things for example how
the properties as they were in

771
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,950 
continuous-time

772
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,930 
can be used to efficiently

773
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,970 
generate the solution and analyze when
your constant coefficient difference

774
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,190 
equations

775
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,380 
and then beyond that the concepts of

776
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,470 
filtering and modulation and

777
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,140 
the both the properties and
interpretation which will very strongly

778
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,250 
parallel

779
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,890 
the kinds of developments along those
lines that we did in the last night

780
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:15,150 
thank you
