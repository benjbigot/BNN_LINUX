the new

12

are

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,600 
for

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,360 
over the last several lectures we've
dealt with the representation

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,400 
of linear time-invariant systems through
convolution

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,710 
and just to remind you over basic
strategy

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,780 
essentially the idea was to

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,229 
exploit the notion of when the arity by

19
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,720 
decomposing the input into summer basic
inputs

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,810 
and then using when the arity to tell us
that the output can be represented as

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,400 
the corresponding linear combination of
the Associated outputs

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,250 
so if we have a linear system

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,759 
either continuous-time and discrete-time
for example with continuous time

24
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,720 
if the input is decomposed as a linear
combination

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,410 
a basic inputs with each of these basic
inputs

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,700 
generating an Associated output and if
the system is linear

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,200 
then the output love the system

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,170 
is the same linear combination love The
Associated outputs

29
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,240 
and the same statement is identical

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,720 
both for continuous-time in
discrete-time so

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,720 
the strategy is to decompose the input
into these basic inputs

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,819 
and the imports

33
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,120 
were chosen also with some particular

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,850 
strategy in mind in particular for both
continuous-time

35
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,230 
for discrete-time in this representation
the

36
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,340 
basic inputs used in the decomposition

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,120 
are chosen first the ball so that

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,670 
a broad class signals can be represented

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,610 
interns are these basic inputs and
second of all

40
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,160 
so that the response to these basic
inputs

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,140 
is in some sense easy to compute now

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,110 
in the representation which latest

43
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,010 
to convolution the particular choice
that we made

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,500 
in the discrete-time case for our basic
inputs

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,250 
was a decomposition up the input interns

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,740 
or delayed impulses and

47
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,340 
The Associated outputs that that
generated

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,120 
were delayed versions of the impulse
response

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,880 
decomposing the input into a linear
combination of these

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,800 
the output into the corresponding linear
combination of these

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,070 
then led to the convolution some in

52
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,160 
the discrete-time case and

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,720 
in the continuous-time case a similar

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,350 
kinda decomposition in terms of impulses
and Associated representation

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,550 
love the output in terms of the impulse
response

56
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,820 
led to the convolution in ago now

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,140 
in this lecture and for number the
succeeding lectures

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,040 
will want to turn our attention to a
very different

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,700 
said the basic building blocks and

60
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,820 
in particular the signals there

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,890 
will be using as the building blocks for
or more general signals

62
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,000 
rather than impulses as we've dealt with
before

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,440 
will be in general complex exponentials

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,530 
so in a general sense

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,989 
in the continuous-time case and will be
thinking in terms of a decomposition

66
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,389 
afar signals as a linear combination
I'll

67
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,440 
complex exponentials continuous-time

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,130 
or in the discrete-time case

69
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,840 
complex exponentials where sees the case
complex here

70
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,270 
in discrete-time and s2 K's complex here

71
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,060 
in continuous-time now

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,960 
the basic strategy of course requires

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,190 
dead we choose a settlement puts basic
building blocks

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,449 
which have two properties one is that

75
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,169 
the system response be straightforward
to compute were in some sense easy to

76
00:04:59,169 --> 00:04:59,759 
compute

77
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,880 
and the second is that it be a fairly
general said a building blocks

78
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,300 
so that we can build lots of signals I
love them

79
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,310 
what will find with complex exponentials
either continuous-time and discrete-time

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,870 
is that they very nicely have those two
properties

81
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,699 
in particular the notion that the

82
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:26,029 
output over linear time-invariant system
is easy to compute

83
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,300 
is tied to what's referred to as the eye
can function property

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,379 
a complex exponentials which will focus
on

85
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,779 
shortly in a little more detail

86
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,199 
and second of all the fact that

87
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,819 
weekend in fact represent very broad
classes have signals as linear

88
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,740 
combinations

89
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,699 
these will be a topic an issue

90
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,389 
that will develop in detail over in fact
are the next

91
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,840 
set of lectures this lecture and the
next set of lectures

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,860 
now in in doing this although

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,319 
we could in fact begin with our
attention focused

94
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,009 
on in general complex exponentials

95
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,120 
what will choose to do his first focus
on the case in which

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,759 
the exponent in the continuous-time
cases

97
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,569 
purely imaginary as i indicate here

98
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,960 
and in the discrete-time case where

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,969 
the magnitude of the complex number Z CK

100
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,710 
is equal to 1 so what that corresponds
to in the continuous-time case

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,719 
is said building blocks

102
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,900 
the form you DJ Omega sed Katie

103
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,240 
and in the discrete-time case said a
building blocks

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,860 
the for eat a DJ Omega KN

105
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,689 
well we'll see is a representation in
these Terms

106
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:56,569 
leads to what's for two as for EA

107
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,159 
analysis and that's what we'll be
dealing with over the next several

108
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,860 
lectures

109
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,349 
will then be exploiting this
representation actually

110
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,469 
through most the course and then toward

111
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:13,189 
the end of the course will returned to
generalizing

112
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,229 
the for a representation to the
discussion over plus transforms the

113
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,219 
transforms

114
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,430 
so for now we want to restrict ourselves
to

115
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,680 
complex exponentials a particular form
in

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,169 
and in fact also initially to
continuous-time

117
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,319 
signals and systems so let's begin

118
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,150 
with the continuous-time case the
complex exponentials that we want to

119
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,900 
deal with

120
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,569 
in and focus first the ball on what I
refer to as

121
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,360 
the eigenfunction property love this
particular set a building blocks

122
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,379 
we're talking about

123
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,219 
basic signals the form either the J
Omega some Katy

124
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,770 
and this statement is there

125
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,229 
for a linear time-invariant system the
response to one of these

126
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,439 
is 0 exactly the same form

127
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,020 
just simply multiplied by a complex

128
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,520 
factor that complex factor depending on

129
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,620 
what the frequency Omega k is

130
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,379 
now more or less the justification for
this is the proof follows by

131
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,699 
simply looking at the response to a
complex exponential

132
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,830 
using the convolution integral so

133
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,870 
if we put a complex exponential

134
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,310 
into a linear time-invariant system

135
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,930 
with impulse response a gypsy then

136
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,240 
we can express the response as i've
indicated here

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,190 
we can then recognize that this complex
exponential

138
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,730 
can be factored into two terms and so

139
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,160 
we can rewrite this complex exponential

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,930 
as this product second recognize

141
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,360 
that this term can be taken

142
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,170 
outside the integral over here because
of the fact that

143
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,310 
it depends only on tea and not on tap
now

144
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,560 
and so what we're left with when we
tracked this through

145
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,920 
is that with a complex exponential input
we get

146
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,250 
an output which is the same complex
exponential

147
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,310 
namely this factor times

148
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,140 
this integral and this integral is

149
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,430 
what I referred to above as

150
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,769 
H all omega-6 K

151
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:41,579 
and so in fact we put in a complex
exponential

152
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:45,390 
we get out a complex exponential love
the same frequency

153
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,380 
multiplied by a complex constant and

154
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,569 
that is what's referred to as the
eigenfunction property I can function

155
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,230 
meaning

156
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,319 
that and I can function of a system or
mathematical expression

157
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:02,600 
is a function which when you put it
through the system

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,079 
comes out looking exactly the same
except for a change in amplitude

159
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,750 
that change in amplitude being the eigen
value so

160
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,810 
in fact this function is

161
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,990 
the eigenfunction

162
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,139 
and this bad you

163
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:27,530 
is the I can bag

164
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,610 
okay now it's because if the
eigenfunction

165
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,140 
property that complex exponentials a
particularly convenient as building

166
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,700 
blocks

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,810 
namely you put it through the system
they come out with the same form

168
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,040 
and simply scale the other part to the
question related

169
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,990 
to the strategy that we've been pursuing
is

170
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,580 
to hope that the signals

171
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,270 
can be used as building blocks to
represent a

172
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,740 
very broad classes signals through
linear combination

173
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,190 
and in fact that turns out to be the
case with complex exponentials

174
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,570 
as we worked our way through that

175
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,390 
will first consider the case love
periodic signals

176
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,450 
and what that leads to is a
representation a periodic signals

177
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,430 
through what's called the forty a series
following that

178
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,550 
we will turn our attention to non
periodic or as I refer to it a periodic

179
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,360 
signals

180
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,020 
and the representation that's developed

181
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,220 
interns love linear combinations a
complex exponentials

182
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,880 
is what's referred to as the 48
transport so

183
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,560 
the first thing that we want to deal
with our periodic signals

184
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,200 
and before you series okay so

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,110 
what we're talking about then is the
continuous-time

186
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,660 
for a series and

187
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,110 
the for a series is a representation for

188
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,810 
periodic continuous-time signals we have

189
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,420 
a signal then which is periodic and

190
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,910 
were choosing t0 to denote the period

191
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,020 
so its t0

192
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,240 
then corresponds to the period

193
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,990 
our periodic signal Omega 0

194
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,250 
is to party over t0 as

195
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,410 
you recall from our discussion love

196
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,400 
periodic signals and sinusoids before
and that's two pirates 0

197
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,230 
so this is the fundamental frequency now

198
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,960 
let's examine first the ball complex
exponentials

199
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,330 
and recognize first the ball that

200
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,450 
there is a complex exponential that has

201
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,570 
exactly the same period and

202
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,350 
fundamental frequency as are more
general periodic signal

203
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,260 
namely the complex exponential you to
the jail maker 0t

204
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,270 
where Omega 0 is to Paul II over t0

205
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:13,170 
or equivalent Lee t0 is to pie over
Omega 0 now

206
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,459 
that's the complex exponential which has

207
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,209 
t0 as the fundamental period but

208
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,600 
think there are harmonically related
complex exponentials

209
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,070 
that also have t0 as a period

210
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,070 
although in fact their fundamental
period shorter

211
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,240 
so we can also look at complex
exponentials

212
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,280 
before either the JK Omega 0t

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,430 
these likewise are periodic

214
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,330 
with the period love t0

215
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,370 
although in fact their fundamental
period

216
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,910 
is t0 divided by K or equivalently

217
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,360 
to par i divided by their fundamental
frequency

218
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,280 
k Omega 0 so as K

219
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,890 
a richer varies these correspond to

220
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,600 
harmonically related complex
exponentials

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,060 
now with the forty a series

222
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,230 
says and will justify this kinda bit by
bit is the discussion goes I'm

223
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,560 
what the four-day series says that in
fact what for EA

224
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,860 
said which was essentially the

225
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,040 
is brilliant insight is that if I have

226
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,690 
a very general periodic signal I can
represented as a linear combination of

227
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,260 
these harmonically related

228
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,500 
complex exponentials so

229
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,950 
that representation is what i've
indicated here

230
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,220 
and this summation is

231
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,770 
what will be referred to as

232
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,490 
the for EA

233
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,009 
series

234
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,899 
and as we proceed with the discussion
there are two issues

235
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,100 
couldn't that will develop one is
assuming

236
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,220 
that our periodic signal can be
represented this way

237
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,490 
how do we determine the for a series
coefficients

238
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,990 
as they refer to a suitcase that's one
question

239
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,220 
and the second question will be

240
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,009 
how broad a class of signals in fact can
be represented that

241
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,689 
this way and bats another question their

242
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:30,120 
will deal with separately

243
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,010 
now just focusing on this representation

244
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,380 
for a minute this representation

245
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,690 
love the four EA series which

246
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,870 
I repeated again

247
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,550 
here

248
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,020 
is what's referred to as the complex

249
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,460 
exponential form love for EA series

250
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,530 
and it's important to note incidently

251
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,400 
day this summation involves frequencies
k Omega 0

252
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,750 
their are both positive and negative

253
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,920 
in other words this index K runs over

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,040 
limits that include both negative values
and positive ads

255
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,710 
now that complex exponential form is one

256
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,980 
representation for before you a series

257
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,430 
and in fact it's the one that we will be
principally

258
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,250 
relying on in this course there is
another representation that

259
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,440 
perhaps you come across previously

260
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,110 
and that in a variety of other contacts
is

261
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,860 
is typically used which is called the
trigonometric form

262
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,400 
the forty a series without really
tracking through the algebra

263
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,270 
essentially we can get to the
trigonometric for

264
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,000 
from the complex exponential form by

265
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,490 
recognizing that if we express the
complex coefficients

266
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,950 
in polar for or in rectangular for

267
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,949 
and expand the complex exponential

268
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,319 
term out in terms of cosine plus J sign

269
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,829 
using just simply Oilers relation then

270
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,510 
in we will end up with the
representation

271
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,550 
for the periodic signal

272
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,970 
were a re expression love the for a
series

273
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,530 
expression that we had previously either
in the form that I indicate here

274
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,540 
we're now the periodic signal is
expressed

275
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,500 
in terms of a summation love cosines

276
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,720 
with appropriate ample to in phase

277
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,280 
or another acquittal or triggered a
metric for

278
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,420 
involves rearranging this

279
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,460 
in terms or a combination

280
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,470 
of cosines and signs now

281
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,400 
in this representation the frequencies
of the sinusoids

282
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,790 
very only over positive frequencies

283
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,060 
and typically one thinks

284
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,260 
of periodic signals is having positive
frequencies associated with them

285
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,610 
however let's look back

286
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,740 
at the complex exponential form

287
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,070 
for the forty a series at the top of the
board

288
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,310 
and in that representation when we use
this representation

289
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,990 
will find it convenient to refer to both

290
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,290 
positive frequencies and negative
frequencies so

291
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,610 
the representation that we will most
typically be using is the complex

292
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,980 
exponential form

293
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,510 
and in that form what will find as we
think it decomposing a periodic signal

294
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,750 
in to its compliments

295
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,770 
at different frequencies it will involve
both positive frequencies

296
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,799 
negative frequencies

297
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,320 
okay now we have the

298
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,940 
for EA series representation as i've
indicated here

299
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,230 
again so far I sidestepped the issue as

300
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,220 
to whether this in fact represents all
the signals that we'd like to represent

301
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,299 
let's first address the issue

302
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,500 
love how we determine these coefficients

303
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,720 
Acer K assuming that in fact this
representation is Val

304
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,820 
and again all kinda move through the
algebra

305
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,490 
fairly quickly its a the outbreak steps
the ones that

306
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,780 
you can pursue more leisurely just the
kinda

307
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,059 
verify them in step through them but

308
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,490 
essentially the algebra develops I did
the recognition

309
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,679 
that if we integrate a complex
exponential

310
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,150 
over one period t0

311
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,970 
and I mean by this notation that this is
an integral

312
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,990 
over a period where I don't particularly
care

313
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,049 
where the period starts and where the
period stops in other words

314
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,070 
exactly what period I picked that this
integral

315
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,840 
is equal to t0 when M is equal to 0

316
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,730 
and it's equal to 0 if am is not equal
to 0

317
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,539 
that follow simply from the fact that if
we substitute in

318
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,630 
for using Oilers relations so that we
have the integral to cosign

319
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,650 
was J times assign if M

320
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,299 
is not equal to 0 than

321
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,940 
of these integrals over a period are

322
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,960 
0 the integral over sign it a periodic
have a sinus or a cosigner sign

323
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,220 
over an integral number periods is zero
whereas

324
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,799 
if M is equal to 0 this in a crawl

325
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,220 
will be equal to 20 the integral the
cosine

326
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,950 
and the integral on the sign is equal to
0

327
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,220 
okay well the next step

328
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,230 
in developing the expression for the
coefficients a Sat K

329
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,590 
is to refer back to

330
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,380 
before a series expression which was
that except he

331
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120 
is equal to the sum with basic K either
the JK Omega 0t

332
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,539 
if we multiply both sides that by either
minus

333
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,090 
jaan Omega 0t and

334
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,090 
integrate that over a period

335
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,640 
both sides of the equation integrated
over a period

336
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,750 
so these two equations are equal and
then

337
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,650 
in essence interchange the summation and
the integration

338
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,860 
so that this pardon the expression cons
outside the psalm

339
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,580 
and then we combine these two complex
exponentials together

340
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,660 
where we come out is

341
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,680 
the expression that i've indicated here
in

342
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,100 
and then essentially what happens at
this point algebraically

343
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,840 
is that we use the result that we just
developed

344
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,780 
to evaluate this cynical so

345
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,170 
multiplying both sides the forty a
series in and doing the integration

346
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,860 
leads us after the appropriate
manipulation

347
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,080 
to the expression that

348
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,920 
I have up here and

349
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,020 
this is equal to

350
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,330 
this integral is equal to t0

351
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,540 
if K is equal to an

352
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,850 
corresponding 20 up here and 80

353
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,270 
otherwise which is what we have
demonstrated or are you previously

354
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,290 
and the upshot of all that then is that

355
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,920 
the right hand side if this expression
disappears

356
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,630 
except for the term when K is equal to n

357
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,540 
and so finally we have what I indicate
here

358
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,880 
taking t0 and moving it over to the
other side of the equation

359
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,120 
we then that then tells us

360
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,560 
how we determine the forty a series
coefficients

361
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,180 
a7 Auris K so

362
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,450 
that in effect and is the

363
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,510 
what we refer to as the analysis
equation the equation that begins with

364
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,530 
excessive to me

365
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,160 
and tells us how to get the for a series
coefficients

366
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,400 
what are referred to as

367
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,480 
the 48 series synthesis equation

368
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480 
is the equation that tells us

369
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,780 
how to build exit see outta love

370
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,450 
these complex exponentials so we have
the synthesis equation

371
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,810 
which is the one that we started from we
have

372
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,460 
the analysis equation which is the
equation

373
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,860 
that we just developed

374
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,770 
okay so we in effect have

375
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,880 
going through the issue love assuming
there for a series representation

376
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,040 
is in fact valid how we get

377
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,100 
the coefficients we want to address

378
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,990 
somewhat the question love how broad a
classic signals that we're talking

379
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,490 
are we talking about and what's in fact
amazing

380
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,630 
and was for EA's amazing insight

381
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,780 
was that it's a very broad class say but

382
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,300 
let's first look at just some examples

383
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,320 
in which we take a signal assume that it
has the Fourier series representation

384
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,740 
and see what the for a series
coefficients look like so

385
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,290 
will begin with what I refer to as

386
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,900 
an antisymmetric periodic square wave
periodic of course because we're talking

387
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,810 
about periodic signals

388
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,920 
square wave referring to its shape and

389
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,700 
antisymmetric referring to the fact that
it is an odd

390
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,630 
time function in other words it is
antisymmetric

391
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,610 
about the origin now

392
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,610 
the expression for the for a series
coefficients

393
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,880 
tells us that we determine a sieve K

394
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,920 
by taking one over 20 times the integral
over a period

395
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,380 
affects 50 either minus JK Omega 0t

396
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,740 
DT the most convenient thing in this
case

397
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,650 
is to choose a period which

398
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,170 
let's say goes from minus 20 over to the
plus 20 over to

399
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,790 
so here except he is -1 here

400
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,820 
expertise plus one and so

401
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,760 
I've expressed the for a series called
efficiency as

402
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,450 
this integral that's from minus 20 over
220

403
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,410 
and then and it said that is the

404
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,380 
positive part of the cycle and so we
have

405
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,720 
these two integrals now I don't want to

406
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,240 
tracked through the details both the
algebra again I

407
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,920 
I guess I've decided that that's much
more fun for you do on your own

408
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,440 
but the way it comes out when you go
through it

409
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,460 
is the expression that I finally
indicate after

410
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,100 
suggesting that there are a few more
steps to follow

411
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,160 
and what develops is that

412
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,810 
those two integrals together for K

413
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,610 
not equal to 0 come out to this
expression

414
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:42,440 
and that expression is not valid for k
equal to 0

415
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,100 
per kg equal to 0 we can go back to

416
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,280 
the basic expression for the forty a
series

417
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,110 
which is one over t0 the integral over a
period

418
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,120 
exit see in the minus JK Omega 0 /td TD

419
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,310 
for cake 10 of course this term

420
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,860 
just simply becomes one and

421
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,580 
so the zeroth coefficient is one over 20
times the integral

422
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,330 
X 50 over a period now

423
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,020 
going back to the original function

424
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,550 
that we have what we're saying then is
that

425
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,100 
0th coefficient is one over 20 times the
integral over

426
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,610 
one period which is in effect the
average value

427
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,130 
and it straight forward to verify the
for this case that average value

428
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,050 
is equal to 0 okay

429
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,320 
now let's look at

430
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,940 
these for a series coefficients on a bar
graph

431
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,050 
and i've indicated that here the

432
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,450 
expression for the for a series
coefficients we just developed and

433
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,460 
a involves its

434
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,900 
0 for cake 0 it's a factor this form

435
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,850 
for canine equal to 0 plotted on a bar
graph

436
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,030 
then we see values like this 0

437
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,500 
at cake 0 and and associated values

438
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,550 
and their number things to focus on

439
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,840 
when you look at this

440
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,320 
one is the fact that the forty a series
coefficients for this example

441
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,830 
are surely imaginary

442
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,320 
a second is that the Fourier series
coefficients for this example

443
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,170 
are odd sequence in other words if you
look at this sequence which you see

444
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,210 
are these values for negative K

445
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,310 
flipped over so there their imaginary

446
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,610 
and odd and

447
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,670 
what that results in when

448
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,680 
you look at the

449
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,820 
the triggered a metric form the 4e a
series

450
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,220 
is that in fact those conditions if you
put the terms altogether

451
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,580 
lead you to a trigger a metric
representation

452
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,010 
which involves only sign terms

453
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,980 
in other words no co-signed turns let me
just draw your attention to the fact

454
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,470 
that

455
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,910 
since a suitcase the acer case or
imaginary

456
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,210 
this jay takes care that fact so that
these coefficients

457
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,910 
are in fact real so what this says

458
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,130 
is that for the antisymmetric square
wave the

459
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,130 
it in effect the forty a series is a
sign series

460
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,900 
the antisymmetric square wave is an odd
function

461
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,420 
sinusoids are not are odd functions and
so this is all kinda reasonable that

462
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,610 
we're building

463
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,760 
odd function ido odd functions

464
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,820 
as an additional aside which a I won't

465
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,860 
exploit or refer to any further here

466
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,580 
but just draw your attention to is that
another aspect

467
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,350 
love this periodic square wave the
particular one that we chose

468
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,550 
is dead it is what's referred to as a

469
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,120 
on harmonic function in other words

470
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,980 
for even values if K

471
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,990 
before a series coefficients 30 their
only 90

472
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,050 
for iPad use K

473
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,100 
okay now let's look at another example
another example

474
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,840 
is the symmetric periodic square wave

475
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,320 
and this is in fact example

476
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,570 
4.5 worked out in more detail in the tax
then

477
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,980 
I won't bother to work work this out in
detail here

478
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,280 
except to draw your attention to several

479
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,310 
points here is the symmetric periodic
square wave

480
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,670 
and what I mean by symmetric

481
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,730 
is that it's an even time function

482
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,490 
now just kinda extrapolating your
intuition

483
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,510 
what we you should expect is that if if
it's a

484
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,100 
only even time function it should be
built up

485
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,670 
or buildable if it's built up a little
%ah to only

486
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,990 
even sinusoids and in fact

487
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,360 
that's the case so if we look at

488
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,710 
the four-day series coefficients for
this

489
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,000 
the zeroth coefficient again as the
average value

490
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,610 
which in this case is a half here I've
plotted

491
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,190 
hi times the for a series coefficients
so

492
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,590 
0 thank you as pie over to

493
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,690 
the coefficients are now and even
sequence

494
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,960 
and in in other words symmetric

495
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,840 
about cake 0 and the consequences that

496
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,090 
is that when you take these coefficients

497
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,740 
and put together the equivalent
triggered a metric form

498
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,800 
the triggered a metric for involves

499
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,280 
only cosines and no

500
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,340 
sign turns now

501
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,400 
you'll see this in and other examples
not that will do in the lecture but

502
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,230 
examples in the text in the video manual
if in fact

503
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,520 
the square way was neither symmetric or
antisymmetric

504
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,680 
then the trigonometric form would
involve both

505
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,580 
sines and cosines and

506
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,640 
that is of course the more general case

507
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,179 
furthermore in the two examples are
shown here

508
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:37,290 
we we in both cases

509
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,310 
the signal is odd harmonic

510
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,870 
in other words for even bad news K

511
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,470 
the coefficients are equal to 0 although
I won't justify that here that's a

512
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,950 
consequence that the fact that

513
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,570 
this symmetry is exactly about half a
period

514
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,960 
and if you made the on time with a
square wave

515
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,250 
different in relation to the of time
then that property would also

516
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,389 
disappear

517
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:07,670 
now

518
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,640 
what's kind amazing actually in

519
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,680 
is that if we take a square wave like

520
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,030 
I have here or as I had in the
antisymmetric case

521
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,760 
the implication is that I can bill

522
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,990 
that square wave by adding up

523
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,700 
on of signs were cosines and

524
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,630 
it really seems kinda amazing because
the square wave after all

525
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,750 
is a very discontinuous functions

526
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,240 
sinusoids are very continuous and it
seems puzzling that in fact

527
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,679 
you can do that well let's look in a
little bit of detail

528
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,980 
how the sinusoidal

529
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,240 
turns and up to

530
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,940 
build a square wave and to do that

531
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,660 
let's first define what I refer to

532
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,110 
as a partial song so

533
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,330 
here we have the expression

534
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,570 
which is the synthesis

535
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,010 
equation telling us how accept T could
be represented

536
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,919 
as complex exponentials if it can be and

537
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:22,530 
let's consider just a finite number of
turns in this song

538
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,850 
and so X 7ft of course as n goes to
infinity

539
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,240 
approaches the infinite sum that we're
talking about and although we could do

540
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,889 
this more generally let's not let's
focus on the symmetric square wave case

541
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,510 
where because it the symmetry of these
coefficients namely that a suitcase

542
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,950 
equal to minus

543
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,429 
is equal to a serb minus K we can
rewrite

544
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,030 
these turns as cosine turns and so this
partial some

545
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,870 
can be express the way arm expressing it
here

546
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,170 
well let's look at

547
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,510 
a few the Stearns on the graph I have

548
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,700 
first the ball exit tea which is our

549
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,790 
original square wave

550
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,590 
the turn that I indicate here

551
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,920 
is the factor over half which

552
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,520 
is this term

553
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,330 
with any calls one that would correspond
to anyone co-signed term

554
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,900 
to that and so the sole those two would
be yes

555
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,349 
which looks a little close to the square
wave but

556
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,920 
certainly not very close to it at all
and in fact

557
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,130 
in its somewhat hard to imagine without

558
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,300 
seeing the terms build-up how in fact by
adding more and more turns we can

559
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,750 
generate something

560
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,849 
that is essentially flat except at the
discontinuities

561
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,619 
so let's look at this example and what
I'd like to show

562
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:58,130 
is this example but now as we add many

563
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,450 
more turns to it and let's see in fact

564
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,510 
how these individual turns add up

565
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,660 
to build up the square way so

566
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,180 
this is the square wave that we want to
build up

567
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,880 
through the forty a series is this some
of sinusoids

568
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,460 
and the term for cake 0 will be a
constant which represents the DC value

569
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,250 
with this

570
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,760 
and so in the partial sum as we develop
it

571
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,150 
the first thing they will show is just
the term for cable 0

572
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,170 
now for cables one we would add to that

573
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,540 
one sinusoidal term and

574
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,200 
so some love the term for cake was one
cake was 0

575
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,940 
is represented here now

576
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,140 
when we go to K calls to because of the
fact that this is an odd harmonic

577
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,980 
function

578
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,550 
in fact the term for cake was it was too

579
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:01,660 
will be will have zero amplitude and so
this won't change

580
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,180 
here we show the

581
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,770 
for a series would cake was to and
there's no change

582
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,820 
and then we will go to cable 23

583
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,580 
and

584
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,070 
and we will be adding then one
additional sinusoidal term here's cake

585
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,910 
was three

586
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,390 
when we go to cable 24 again there won't
be any change

587
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,940 
but their will be another term that's

588
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,500 
added at cake was five here and cable 6

589
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,480 
again because it's odd harmonic no
change and finally cable 7

590
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,380 
is shown here okay and we can begin to
see that

591
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,680 
this starts to look somewhat like the
square wave but

592
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,470 
now to really emphasize how this builds
up let's

593
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,110 
more rapidly and Ed many more terms and
in fact

594
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,250 
increase the number of turns up to about
a hundred recognizing

595
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,830 
that the shape will only change on the
inclusion

596
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,370 
all the odd number terms not the
even-numbered turns because it's an odd

597
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,900 
harmonic function so now we're

598
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,720 
increasing and we're building up toward

599
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,150 
k equal to 100 200 turns an

600
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,510 
notice that it is the higher

601
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,840 
order turns dead tend to build up

602
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,010 
the discontinuity corresponding to the
notion

603
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,620 
there'd the discontinuities or sharp
edges in a signal

604
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,280 
in fact are represented through the
higher

605
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,770 
frequencies in the forty a series and
here we have

606
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,050 
a not too unreasonable approximation

607
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,710 
to the original square wave there is the
artifact of the ripples at the

608
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,750 
discontinuity and in fact

609
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,490 
though that rippling behavior at the
discontinuities

610
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,180 
is referred to as the Gibbs phenomenon

611
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,710 
and it's an inherent part love the forty
a series representation at

612
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,840 
discontinuities

613
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,960 
now to emphasize this

614
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,340 
let's decrease the number of turns back
down

615
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,200 
and we will carry this down

616
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,290 
to k equal to 1 again

617
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,920 
to emphasizes how the sinusoids are
building up

618
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,080 
the square wave here we are back at Cape
cools

619
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,420 
1 and then finally we

620
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,480 
will and back in the sinusoids that we
took out

621
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,940 
and let's build this back up to 100
turns

622
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,180 
showing the approximation dead

623
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:48,180 
we generated with a hundred turns to the
square way

624
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,690 
okay so so what you saw is that

625
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,720 
in fact we got awfully close to a square
wave

626
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,180 
and the other thing think that was kind
of interesting about it is that went

627
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,830 
along

628
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:15,720 
was the fact that with the low
frequencies

629
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,150 
what we were tending to bill was the
general behavior

630
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,280 
and as the higher frequencies came in

631
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,370 
that tended to contribute the
discontinuities

632
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,090 
work contribute to the discontinuity and

633
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,400 
in fact something their will

634
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,730 
standout more and more as we go through
our discussion

635
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,510 
love for a series of 48 transforms is

636
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,430 
that general statement that its the
low-frequency

637
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,330 
terms bat represent

638
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,710 
the broad time behavior and

639
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,270 
its the high-frequency terms that are
used to build up

640
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,760 
the sharp transitions in the time domain

641
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,839 
okay now we need to get a little more
precise

642
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,040 
about the question of how in fact

643
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,260 
the 48 series

644
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,470 
or when before you a series represents

645
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,000 
the functions that we're talking about
and in what sense they represent them

646
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,369 
in and so if we look

647
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:25,360 
again at the synthesis

648
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,360 
ok wage in were really wanna ask

649
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,620 
is if we add up enough for these terms

650
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,840 
in what sense does this some represent

651
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,320 
this time function well

652
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,310 
let's again use the notion love are
partial some

653
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,320 
so we have the partial song down here

654
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,490 
in and we can think love the difference
between

655
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,120 
this partial some and the

656
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,300 
original time function as

657
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,780 
the ever and I've defined the error here

658
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,040 
and what we would like to know is does
this error

659
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,790 
decrease as we aired more and more turns

660
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,400 
and in fact in what sense if the air
does decrease in what sense

661
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,700 
there's a decrease now in detail

662
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,630 
this is a fairly complicated an
elaborate topic I don't mean to make

663
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,940 
that sound frightening

664
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,060 
its mainly a statement that I don't want
to explore it and a lot of detail

665
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,000 
but it relates to what is referred to

666
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,230 
as the issue a convergence the forty a
series

667
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,120 
and the convergence the 48 series

668
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,120 
the the bottom line on at the kinda and
statement

669
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,560 
can be made in several ways one
statement

670
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,050 
related to convergence the for a series
is the following if

671
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,680 
I have a time function which

672
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,580 
is what is referred to as square
integrable namely

673
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,040 
its integral over a period is finite
then

674
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,400 
what you can show kinda amazingly

675
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,040 
is that the energy E in

676
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,500 
that error in other words the energy in
the difference between the original

677
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,520 
function

678
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,330 
and the partial some the energy and that

679
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:25,420 
goes to zero as n goes to infinity

680
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:31,089 
a somewhat tighter condition is a
condition referred to as it the racially

681
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:34,319 
conditions which says that

682
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,640 
if the time function

683
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,599 
is absolutely integral not square
honorable but absolutely integral

684
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,940 
and I've kinda hedge the issue by just
simply referred to accept T as being

685
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,969 
well behaved

686
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:55,529 
then the statement is dead the error in
fact goes to zero

687
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,239 
as and increases except at the
discontinuities

688
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,210 
and what well-behaved means in that
statement

689
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,089 
is that as discussed in the book there
are a finite number

690
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:12,180 
maxima and minima in any period and a
finite number finite discontinuities

691
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,640 
which is essentially

692
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,170 
always the case so under square in Accra
bility

693
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,839 
what we have is the statement not that
the partial sum goes to the right value

694
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:23,769 
at every point

695
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:27,599 
but that the energy in the air goes to
zero

696
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,700 
under the jewish way conditions it says
that in fact the signal goes to the

697
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,759 
right back to you

698
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:37,749 
at every time instant except

699
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:41,210 
at the discontinuities so

700
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:46,800 
going back to the square wave

701
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,770 
the square wave satisfies either one of
those conditions and so

702
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,180 
what the consequences is that with the
square wave

703
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,800 
if we looked at the error then in fact

704
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,880 
what we would find is that the energy

705
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,150 
in the error would go to zero as we at

706
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,680 
more and more turns in the partial some
and in fact

707
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,350 
if says the square wave also satisfies
the dish les conditions

708
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,040 
the actual value with the air the
difference between

709
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,670 
the partial some and the true value will
will

710
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,450 
actually go to zero that difference will
go to zero

711
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,050 
except at the discontinuities and

712
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,470 
that in fact is kinda evident as

713
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,940 
we watch the function build-up

714
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,390 
by adding up these terms and so in fact

715
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,060 
let's go back and see again

716
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,350 
the development the partial sons

717
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,750 
in relation to the original time
function let's observe

718
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,990 
this time again basically what we saw
before which is that it builds up

719
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:00,600 
to the right answer and furthermore what
will plot this time also as a function

720
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,340 
of time

721
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,190 
is the energy in the air and what we'll
see is that the energy in the air

722
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,570 
will be tending toward zero as the
number

723
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,730 
turns increases so

724
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,910 
once again we have the square wave and

725
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,990 
we want to again show the buildup of the

726
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,230 
forty a series this time showing also

727
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,320 
how the energy in the air decreases as
we had more and more turns

728
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,570 
well once again will begin

729
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,140 
with cake was 0 corresponding to the
constant term

730
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,250 
and was shown on the bottom trace is

731
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,700 
the energy in the air between those two
and

732
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,130 
will then and the term for cables 1

733
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:49,070 
to the DC term and will see that the
energy will decrease

734
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:53,660 
when we do that here we have then the
summer

735
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,790 
cake 10 cables 1 now

736
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,550 
with cables to the energy won't decrease

737
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:07,329 
any further because it's an odd harmonic
function

738
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:12,510 
that's what we've just added in when we
add in the term for cables 3

739
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,700 
again will see the energy in the air
decrease

740
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:22,460 
as reflected in the bottom curve

741
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,460 
so there we are at cables 3 when

742
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,410 
we go to cable 24 there again is no
change in the air

743
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:38,410 
at cables 5 again the air decreases

744
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,540 
k equal to 6% know there will be no
change again

745
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,300 
an 8k course 7 the energy decreases

746
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,470 
and now let's show the how the air
decreases by building up the number

747
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:56,440 
turns much more rapidly already the air
has gotten somewhat small on the scale

748
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,990 
in which were showing it so let's expand
out

749
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,130 
the ever scale the vertical axis

750
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,810 
displaying the energy in the error so
that we could watch

751
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,980 
how the energy decreases as

752
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,550 
we had more and more terms so here we
have

753
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,700 
the vertical scale expanded and

754
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,720 
now what we'll do is increase

755
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,250 
the number of turns in the forty a
series and watch the energy in the air

756
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,450 
at decreasing

757
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,730 
always decreasing of course on the
inclusion

758
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,580 
love the odd number turns and

759
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,310 
not on the inclusion of the
even-numbered turns because the fact

760
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,450 
that it's an odd harmonic function now
the energy in the air

761
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:43,100 
asymptotically will approach 0 although

762
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,230 
point by point the forty a series will
never be equal to the square wave

763
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,520 
it will at every instant of time

764
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,560 
except at the discontinuities where
there will always be

765
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,010 
some ripple corresponding to

766
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,870 
what's referred to as the Gibbs
phenomenon

767
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:08,410 
okay well so what we've seen in is

768
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,620 
a and a quick look at the Fourier series

769
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,940 
representation love periodic signals

770
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,100 
we more broadly

771
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,670 
wanna have a more general representation

772
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:29,540 
love oath signals in terms of complex
exponentials and so our next step

773
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,370 
will be to move toward a representation

774
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,600 
I'll not periodic or a periodic signals

775
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,660 
now the details if this I leave for the
next lecture

776
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,800 
the only thought that I want introduced
at this point

777
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,890 
is the basic strategy you which

778
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,040 
is somewhat amazing and kinda
interesting to reflect on

779
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,310 
in the interim the basic strategy

780
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,840 
with in a periodic signal is

781
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,520 
to think love representing

782
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,350 
this a periodic signal as a linear
combination of complex exponentials

783
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:11,380 
by this simple trick all

784
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,690 
periodically replicating this signal

785
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,770 
generating a periodic signal

786
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,020 
using a Fourier series representation

787
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,640 
for that periodic signal and then

788
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,000 
simply letting the period go to infinity

789
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,960 
as the period goes to infinity that
periodic signal becomes the original

790
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,860 
a periodic one that we have before and a
40 a series

791
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:43,860 
representation then becomes what we
refer to as the Fourier transform so

792
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,900 
that's just a quick look at kind of the
basic idea

793
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,130 
and approach that will take in the next
lecture will develop this

794
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,500 
a little more carefully more fully
moving from the 40 a series which we've

795
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,360 
used for periodic signals

796
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,560 
to develop the for EA transform

797
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,760 
which will then be representation for a
periodic see

798
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,580 
thank you
