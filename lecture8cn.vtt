here is an example in which

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
we can think other periodic signal

the Fourier transform love this is a constant
傅立叶变换的爱，这是一个恒定的

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and this of course has a forty a series representation
这当然有一个40一个级数表示

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so the Fourier transform or
因此，傅立叶变换或

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the original in polls is just a constant the Fourier transform
原来在民意调查只是一个恒定的傅立叶变换

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
love the periodic signal is
爱的周期信号是

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
an impulse train where the heights at the impulses

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
are proportional to the forty a series coefficients
正比于40一系列系数

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and of course we could previously have computed
当然，我们可以前面已经计算

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the forty a series coefficients to that imposed strain
四十一系列系数所规定的应变

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and those for a series coefficients are as I've shown here
和那些为一系列系数是因为我已经在这里显示

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
so on both these cases these in effect
这样就这两种情况下这些效应在

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
represent just a change in notation we're here we have a bar graph in here
代表符号只是改变我们在这里，我们有一个条形图在这里

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
we have been imposed strain
我们一直在施加应变

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and both at the is simply represent
而无论是在简单地代表

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
samples of what we have above
我们有什么样以上

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
which is the for EA transform
这是对EA变换

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
love the original a periodic sick
爱情原来定期生病

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
okay now once again I suspect that kinda
还好现在我再次怀疑，还挺

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
moving back and forth and and trying to straighten out when we're talking about
来回移动，并与试图理顺，当我们在谈论

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
periodic in a periodic signals
周期性的周期信号

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
may require a little mental gymnastics initially
可能需要一点点的精神体操开始

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
basically what we try to do is
基本上我们尝试做的是什么

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
incorporate within one framework representation for both
在为一个统一的框架表示合并

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
a periodic and and periodic signals in the Fourier transform
在傅立叶周期性和与周期信号变换

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
provides us with a mechanism to do that
为我们提供了一种机制来做到这一点

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
in the next lecture I'll continue with the discussion
在接下来的演讲中，我将继续讨论

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
or the continuous-time for EA transform in particular focusing
或连续时间对EA变换特别侧重

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
on a number of its properties summer which we've already seen namely the
关于它的一些特性的夏天，我们已经看到即

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
symmetry properties
对称性质

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
we'll see lots of other properties that relate
我们会看到很多，涉及其他物业

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of course both to the 48 transform and to the for users
当然同时向48转换和向用户

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
thank you
谢谢
