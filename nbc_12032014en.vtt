00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I get to depict the wreckage would a mediately refocus this investigation what caused the crash mechanical human air or something else

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:47,000
amendments highly experienced and also a veteran pilot Greg thank you for joining us do you believe images of Nursing now late today are showing us the plains record

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
based on the resolution of these images of skeptical at this point

00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
normal if you have pieces of aircraft or possibly peace the bear crap this large you would expect to see a large debris field cause this is a very large piece of wood pieces of aircraft

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:15,000
so you would expect to see not only the the 7472 foot piece of of structure if this is airplane what all the Dupre that would go with a seat cushion seat if the water is in debt

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:29,000
what you're saying as you're not banking on it so it isn't the wreckage in a plane didn't fack make a turn as we hurt earlier today and we just heard from Tom Costello could we in fact im looking possibly at a criminal investigation here

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
think that still has to be considered given the fact that we've had burying information over the last 5 days nothing has been confirmed in the stuff that we thought was confirm some of the information has been physically retracted

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
so I think we have to wear these the best Gators what have to continue to pursue intentional act of Criminal aspect of it as well as possible

00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so you're saying that you wouldn't Doris data search continues not a long the flight path as we saw these images according to the China as a television news agency that that's where they took the photographs you're saying that you should still be looking in the Indian Ocean

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
women validate what's that object is that is on a satellite image somebody needs to actually looking identify that as aircraft parkour parts

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:30,000
what you can't give up where that radar image with coming from because there are a number of radar points a word very very Furman saying we had this airplane track so you must continue a long bath Pappas wealth and possibly even further
