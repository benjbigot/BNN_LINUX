058110~004760~in discussing filtering modulation sampling we've seen how powerful
062870~004160~and useful the four EA transform is beginning
067030~003360~with this lecture and over the next several lectures I'd
070390~004019~like to develop and exploit a generalization
074409~005201~other 48 transform which will not only lead to some important new insights
079610~002100~about signals and systems
081710~003710~but also will remove some of the restrictions
085420~006410~that we've had with the Fourier transform the generalization
091830~005130~dead we'll be talking about in the continuous-time cases referred to
096960~005320~as the apostrophe its form and in the discrete-time cases referred to as the z
102280~000890~transform
103170~004540~but I'd like to do in today's lecture is begin on the continuous-time
107710~003049~case namely a discussion at the La Paz transform
110759~003661~continued at it to the next lecture and following that
114420~004069~develop the z transform for discrete-time
118489~003621~and also as we go along exploit
122110~003459~the two notions together now
125569~003440~to introduce the notion of the law applies transform
129009~006901~let me remind you again all what led us into the Fourier transform we
135910~003170~develop the 48 transform by
139080~003690~considering the idea love representing
142770~004549~signals as linear combinations a basic signals
147319~003041~and in the Fourier transform in the
150360~003959~continuous-time case the basic signals
154319~004111~that we picked in the representation were complex exponentials
158430~003220~and in what we refer to as
161650~004250~the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded
165900~004930~to in effect a dick opposition as a linear combination
170830~005510~decomposition affects ft as a linear combination of complex exponentials
176340~003110~and of course associated with this was
179450~003310~the corresponding analysis equation dead
182760~004679~in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials
187439~004121~now why did we pick complex exponentials
191560~003069~well recall that the reason was
194629~004110~that complex exponentials are I can functions of linear time-invariant
198739~001260~systems
199999~003140~and that was very convenient specifically
203139~004451~if we have a linear time-invariant system
207590~004269~with an impulse response 850 well we had shown
211859~004821~is that that class a systems has the property
216680~004259~that if we put in a complex exponential we get out
220939~003840~a complex exponential at the same frequency
224779~004180~and with the change in amplitude and this change in amplitude
228959~004860~in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along
233819~003150~to 248 transform all
236969~004170~the system impulse response so
241139~003680~the notion love decomposing signals
244819~005150~into complex exponentials was very intimately connected in the Fourier
249969~002450~transforms very intimately connected
252419~004681~with the eigenfunction property a complex exponentials for linear
257100~001520~time-invariant systems
258620~005019~well complex exponentials have that type are not
263639~004471~the only I can functions for linear time-invariant systems
268110~003820~in fact what you've seen previously
271930~003090~is that if we took a more general exponential
275020~003410~you to the st. where s
278430~003800~is a more general complex number not just J Omega
282230~005220~but in fact Sigma plus J Omega for any bad you have s
287450~003930~a comp the complex exponential is an eigenfunction
291380~004700~and we can justify that simply by substitution into the convolution
296080~000940~integral
297020~003520~in other words the response to this complex exponential
300540~003309~is the convolution up the impulse response
303849~003331~with the exhortation an notice
307180~004480~there we can break this term into a product
311660~003300~eat to the st. you need to the minus s
314960~003160~now and BU the st. term
318120~003160~become outside the integration
321280~003859~and consequently just carrying through that algebra
325139~003400~would reduce this integral
328539~003621~to an integral with
332160~005590~in the st. fact there outside so just simply carrying through the algebra
337750~004210~what we would conclude is that a complex exponential
341960~005030~with any complex number ass which generate as an output
346990~003280~a complex exponential have the same form
350270~003200~multiplied by whatever this integral is
353470~004740~and this integral of course will depend on what the value a veces
358210~004000~but that's all that it will depend on or said another way
362210~003650~what this all can be denoted as
365860~003260~is some function Hibs that
369120~003490~depends on the value of s so finally
372610~003279~then you the st. as an exhortation
375889~003930~to linear time-invariant system generates a response
379819~003771~which is a complex constant depending on S
383590~003229~multiplying the same
386819~003521~function that excited the system
390340~003280~so what we have been is
393620~004500~the I can function property more generally in terms of
398120~003160~a more general complex exponential
401280~005379~where the complex factor is given by this integral
406659~004290~well in fact with that integral corresponds to
410949~003631~is what we will the fine
414580~004260~as the apostrophe its form of the impulse response
418840~004130~and in fact we can apply this transformation
422970~004669~to a more general time function that may or may not be
427639~004701~the impulse response this ove a linear time-invariant system
432340~004180~and so in general it is this transformation
436520~003060~on a time function which is
439580~003480~the a-plus transform that time function
443060~003160~and it's a functional bests so
446220~003800~the definition up the applause transform
450020~004639~is that the applause transform overtime function X 50
454659~003931~is the result love this transformation
458590~003460~on exit to the it's the noted as excessive ass
462050~005160~and as a shorthand notation as we had with the four EA transform
467210~004389~then we have in the time domain the time function except the
471599~003431~and in the apostrophe its form domain the
475030~003069~function XFS and these then
478099~003451~represent a transformed pair
481550~003310~now let me remind you that
484860~003149~that the the development of that mapping
488009~004041~is exactly the process that we went through initially in developing
492050~005190~a mapping that ended up giving the giving us the Fourier transform
497240~003479~essentially what we've done is just broaden your horizon
500719~003420~some white or our notation some white
504139~004620~and rather than pushing just the complex exponential through the system
508759~004030~we've pushed a more general time function either the st.
512789~006331~where ass is a complex number with both a real part in an imaginary part
519120~003669~well the discussion we going through so far course is
522789~003521~very closely related to when what we went through
526310~003280~for the Fourier transform the mapping and we've ended up with
529590~004530~is called the applause transform and as you can well imagine and perhaps
534120~004220~may have recognized already there's a very close connection
538340~005190~between the applause transform and the Fourier transform
543530~003690~well to see wanted the connections well we can observe
547220~006190~is that if we look at the Fourier transform expression
553410~004080~and if we look at the applause transform expression
557490~005930~where ass is now a general complex number Sigma plus jail maker
563420~004380~these two expressions in fact are identical
567800~003960~if in fact Sigma is equal to 0
571760~003889~if signatures equal to 0 so that ass is just jail maker
575649~003310~then all that this transformation is
578959~003870~is the same as that substitute in s equals jail maker
582829~004711~and this is what we get so
587540~005680~what this then tells us is dead if we have the apostrophe it's for
593220~003730~and if we look at the applause transform at
596950~004720~ass equals J Omega
601670~003560~then that in fact corresponds to
605230~004180~the Fourier transform affect safety
609410~003830~now there's a slight notational issue
613240~004310~that this raises and it's very straightforward to clean it up
617550~003529~but it's something that its you have to just kinda
621079~004351~focus on for second to understand what the issue is
625430~004260~notice that on the left hand side of this equation
629690~003850~X a vast representing the applause transform
633540~004370~when we look at that would signal to 0 RS equal to jail maker
637910~003150~are natural inclination is to write that
641060~003040~as exit J Omega of course
644100~003690~on the other hand the right hand side of the equation namely the Fourier
647790~001870~transform exit T
649660~003760~we've typically written as
653420~003830~X all Omega focusing on the fact that
657250~003350~it's a function love this variable Omega
660600~003700~well there's a slight awkwardness here because here we're talking about
664300~003620~an argument J Omega here we're talking about an argument Omega
667920~003300~and a very straightforward way of dealing with that is
671220~003040~to simply change our notation
674260~004720~for the Fourier transform recognizing that the Fourier transform
678980~003229~course is a function of Omega but it's also
682209~004211~in fact the function J Omega and if we write it that way
686420~005240~then the two notations come together in other words the applause transform
691660~004630~at st. cause jail maker just simply were reduces both mathematically and
696290~001000~rotationally
697290~005440~to the Fourier transform so the notation that will now be adopting
702730~003530~for the four th transform is the notation
706260~005400~whereby we express the 48 transform no longer simply as active Omega
711660~004109~but choosing as the argument jail make
715769~003851~simple notational change
719620~004760~now here we see one relationship between the Fourier transform and
724380~003160~the the plots transform namely that
727540~005220~the poss transform pressequals chair maker reduces to the Fourier transform
732760~004600~we also have number another important relationship
737360~003400~in particular the fact that the
740760~003139~applause transform can be interpreted
743899~004261~as the Fourier transform all a modified
748160~004669~version affect safety let let me show you what I mean
752829~003351~here of course we have the relationship that we just developed
756180~006370~namely s equals jail maker plus transform reduces the Fourier transform
762550~004899~but now let's look at the more general applause transform expression
767449~004301~and if we substitute in s equals Sigma plus J Omega
771750~005070~which is the general form for this complex variable ass
776820~003699~and we carry through so the algebra
780519~004291~breaking this into the product up to exponential
784810~003170~the product the two exponential see the minus Sigma T
787980~003650~time see the minus jail make it to the we now have
791630~004560~this expression where of course in both these
796190~003980~their is a DT
800170~004310~and now when we look at this
804480~003070~what we observe is that this in fact
807550~003349~is the 48 transform of something
810899~004521~what's the something it's not accept T anymore it's the Fourier transform up
815420~001310~x50
816730~003990~multiplied by e2 the minus Sigma T
820720~003030~so if we think I've these two terms together
823750~003190~this in a brawl is just the four EA transform
826940~003569~it's the for a transformer Beck city multiplied
830509~003871~by an exponential Sigma is greater than
834380~003220~its a an exponential that
837600~005549~the case with time Sigma is less than 0 it's an exponential the crows
843149~003521~time so we have
846670~005029~then this additional relationship which tells us that the apostrophe s for
851699~003371~is the 48 transform love
855070~004540~and exponentially weighted time function
859610~003839~now this exponential weighting has
863449~004500~some important significance in particular
867949~003950~recall that there were issues have convergence with the 48 transform in
871899~003680~particular the Fourier transform
875579~003240~may or may not converge and for convergence in fact
878819~003841~what's required is that but I'm fortunate we're transforming be
882660~003169~absolutely integral now
885829~005421~we can have a time function that isn't absolutely integral
891250~003759~because let's say it grows exponentially as time
895009~004250~increases but when we multiply it by this
899259~004320~exponential factor that's embodied in a posh transform
903579~004401~in fact that brings the function back down for positive time
907980~003640~and will impose absolute integrability
911620~003430~on the product %uh XFT times
915050~003570~e2 the minus Sigma T and so
918620~003350~the conclusion an important point is that
921970~004609~the applause transformed the Fourier transform this product may converge
926579~004060~even though the Fourier transform effective t doesn't in other words
930639~004390~the apostrophe s form may converge even when the Fourier transform
935029~003821~doesn't converge and will see that will see examples of it is the discussion
938850~003070~goes along now let me also
941920~003000~draw your attention to the fact although we won't be
944920~003800~working through this in detail
948720~003169~to the fact that this equation
951889~003570~in effect provides the basis
955459~004370~for us to figure out how to express accept T
959829~003281~interns love the applause transform
963110~004260~effect we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to this
967370~004260~thereby to this account for the exponential factor by bring it over to
971630~001350~the other side
972980~003149~and if you go through this and in fact
976129~004491~you'll have an opportunity to go through this both in the video course manual
980620~004130~and also it's carried through in the text
984750~003279~what you end up with is
988029~003461~a synthesis equation X expression for exit T
991490~004219~in terms of Xmas which corresponds to a synthesis equation
995709~004990~and which now builds x50 I have a linear combination if not
1000699~003880~necessarily functions the foreign to the Chi Omega TV
1004579~003500~but interns love functions
1008079~004260~or basic signals which are more general exponentials
1012339~003490~you to the st.
1015829~003351~okay well let's just look at
1019180~004159~some examples love the apostrophe s form of some time functions
1023339~003480~and these examples that I'll go through
1026819~005151~are all examples that are worked out in attacks and so I don't want to focus on
1031970~002650~the algebra what I'd like to focus on
1034620~003820~are some with the issues and the interpretation
1038440~003700~let's first the ball look at example
1042140~003679~the example in the text which is example 9.1
1045819~003551~if we take the Fourier transform
1049370~004210~love this exponential then as you well know
1053580~003470~the result that we have is one over J Omega plus a
1057050~004020~and bekannt converge for any a
1061070~003620~in particular it's only for a greater than 0
1064690~004520~what that really means is that for convergence of the 48 transform this has
1069210~001040~to be
1070250~003450~a decaying exponential it can't be
1073700~003589~in increasing exponentially if
1077289~004681~instead we apply the applause transformed to this
1081970~004490~applying to the the deal applies transform is the same as taking the 48
1086460~001060~transform or
1087520~003560~X 50 times an exponential in and
1091080~004660~the exponential that we would multiply by is he to the minus Sigma T
1095740~005049~so in effect taking the applause transform of this
1100789~005221~is like taking the Fourier transform augie to the minus eighty
1106010~003890~e2 the minus Sigma T
1109900~003259~and if we carry that through just
1113159~003091~working through the integral we end up
1116250~005870~with applause transform which is one over est plus a
1122120~005010~but just as in the Fourier transform
1127130~003419~the Fourier transform all converge for any a
1130549~003171~now what happens is that the
1133720~003300~love pasta Rance form will only converge
1137020~003399~when the forty a transformer this converges
1140419~004630~said another way it's when the combination is a plus Sigma
1145049~003880~is greater than 0 so we would require
1148929~003620~that by right over here a plus Sigma
1152549~003760~is greater than 0 warmer that Sigma
1156309~004431~is greater than minus a so in fact
1160740~003059~in the apostrophe s former this
1163799~003791~we have an expression one over est plus a but
1167590~003480~we also require in interpreting that
1171070~003680~dead the real party bass be greater
1174750~003650~then minus a so that
1178400~003720~essentially the 48 transform up X 50
1182120~003189~times you to the minus Sigma T converges
1185309~003081~so it's important to recognize that the
1188390~003510~algebraic expression that we get is
1191900~004630~only valid for certain values love the real party vez
1196530~003889~and so for this example we can summarize it as
1200419~005671~this exponential as the apostrophe s form which is one over est plus a
1206090~004620~where ass is restricted to the range the real party best greater than
1210710~004540~minus a now
1215250~004780~we haven't had this issue before love restrictions on what the value a veces
1220030~003840~with the with 48 transform either recover Jordan converge
1223870~004410~with a plot strands form there are certain values the best we now have more
1228280~004019~flexibility and so they're certain values are the real party best for which
1232299~004071~it converges in certain values for which it doesn't
1236370~003610~the values Ave S for which the apostrophe s form
1239980~003800~converges is the values
1243780~003560~are referred to as the region of convergence
1247340~003089~up the applause transform
1250429~004521~and it's important to recognize that
1254950~004380~in specifying the applause transform what's required is not only the
1259330~001930~algebraic expression
1261260~004600~but also the domain or set of values evas
1265860~003460~for which that algebraic expression is
1269320~003849~ballot just two
1273169~004041~underscore that point let me draw your attention to another
1277210~004680~example in the text which is example 9.2
1281890~003740~example 9.2 we have an exponential
1285630~004409~for negative time 0 for positive time
1290039~003341~and if you carry through the algebra there you end up with
1293380~005279~a low price transform expression which is again one over S plus a
1298659~005750~exactly the same algebraic expression as we head for the previous example
1304409~003571~the important distinction is that now
1307980~003929~the real party bass is restricted to be less than minus a
1311909~004471~it so in fact if you compare this example
1316380~003220~with the one above it and let's just look back at
1319600~003760~the answer that we had the air
1323360~003260~if you compare that those two examples here
1326620~004530~the algebraic expression is 100 breast but say with a certain
1331150~003170~regional convergence here
1334320~003849~the algebraic expression is one over est plus a
1338169~003961~and the only difference between those two is the domain a region of
1342130~000860~convergence
1342990~004830~so there's another complication or twist now
1347820~005349~not only do we need to generate the algebraic expression
1353169~003311~but we also have to be careful to specify
1356480~003100~the region of convergence
1359580~004699~over which that algebraic expression is valid
1364279~003851~now later on in this lecture and actually also
1368130~004159~arm as the discussion a little past transform goes on
1372289~003140~will begin to see and understand more about
1375429~003451~how the region of convergence relates to
1378880~004179~various properties of the time function
1383059~005091~okay well let's finally look at one additional example from the tax
1388150~004080~and this is example 9.3 and what it consists of
1392230~003840~is the a type function which is the sum
1396070~003219~love two exponentials and
1399289~004681~although we haven't formally talked about properties a little fuss transform
1403970~000670~yet
1404640~003149~what are the properties that will see it is relatively easy to develop
1407789~003221~is the fact that the apostrophe s form of Assam
1411010~004630~is the summer the applause transform so in fact we can get
1415640~004600~the applause transform love the solo these two terms
1420240~003960~as some love the apostrophe its forms
1424200~003560~and so for this one we know from the
1427760~004010~example that we at looked at previously example 9.1
1431770~003180~that this is a form one over est plus one
1434950~005849~with a region of convergence which is the real party best greater than -1
1440799~004961~for this one we have a poss transform which is one over est plus two
1445760~003950~with a region of convergence which is the real party bass
1449710~003219~greater than -2 so
1452929~005221~for the two of them together we have to take the overlap with those two regions
1458150~004529~in other words we have to take the region that encompasses both the real
1462679~001841~party best greater than -1
1464520~005379~in the real party best greater than -2 and if we put those together then
1469899~004051~we have a combined regional convergence which is the real party best
1473950~005190~greater than -1 so this is the expression
1479140~003889~and for this particular example what we have
1483029~003140~is a ratio of polynomials
1486169~004421~the ratio polynomials is a numerator polynomial and at the nominator
1490590~001100~polynomial
1491690~003080~and it's convenient to
1494770~003310~summarize these by
1498080~003459~plotting the roots love the numerator polynomial
1501539~004591~and the roots to the denominator polynomial in the complex plane
1506130~003510~and the complex plane which they are plotted is referred to
1509640~003710~as vs playing
1513350~004740~so we can for example take the denominator polynomial
1518090~004020~and summarize it in by specifying the fact
1522110~003000~or by representing the fact
1525110~004890~that it has roots at st. cause -1 and at a Sikh was minus-2
1530000~003679~and I've done that in this picture by putting an X
1533679~004191~where the roots have the denominator polynomial order
1537870~003659~the numerator polynomial has a rude ass equals
1541529~003291~-3 hands and i've represented that by a circle
1544820~003430~so these are the roots to the denominator polynomial
1548250~003640~and this is the route up the numerator polynomial for this example
1551890~003960~and also for this example we can represent
1555850~003170~the region of convergence which
1559020~004159~is the real party best greater than -1 and so that's in fact
1563179~003551~the region over here
1566730~003679~there is also if I draw these just the router the numerator and denominator
1570409~001941~plan of polynomials
1572350~003090~I would need an additional piece of information
1575440~003849~to specify the algebraic expression completely namely
1579289~004911~multiply constant out in front of the whole thing
1584200~003500~well this particular example has
1587700~003479~the applause transform as a
1591179~004750~rational function namely its one polynomial in the numerator and another
1595929~002130~polynomial in the denominator
1598059~004171~and in fact as we'll see applies transformers which are ratios are
1602230~001250~polynomials
1603480~003870~form a very important class they were in fact represent systems
1607350~003299~better describe a ball by linear constant coefficient differential
1610649~000890~equations
1611539~004671~you shouldn't necessarily in fact for sure you shouldn't see why
1616210~003310~that's true now will see that later but
1619520~004000~that means that a-plus transforms
1623520~004190~that are rational functions namely
1627710~004870~the ratio love the numerator polynomial divided by the nominator polynomial
1632580~006069~become very important in the discussion that follows
1638649~005130~and in fact in we have some terminology for this the route so the numerator
1643779~001161~polynomial
1644940~003200~are referred to as zeros
1648140~004960~up the applause transform because of course those are the values a bass
1653100~003709~at which XFS become 0
1656809~003321~and the roots to the denominator polynomial are
1660130~004289~referred to as the polls up the applause transform
1664419~003541~and those are the values vs
1667960~004110~at which the applause transform blows up
1672070~004020~namely becomes infinite if you think love setting s
1676090~003839~equal to evaluate this denominator polynomial goes to zero
1679929~003461~of course extra bass becomes infinite and
1683390~003490~what we would expect in a course will see that
1686880~003590~that this is true well we would expect
1690470~003490~is that wherever that happens there must be some problem
1693960~004170~with convergence oval poss transform and indeed the applause transformed doesn't
1698130~000880~converge
1699010~005350~at the polls namely at the roots the denominator polynomial
1704360~003770~so in fact let's focus in on that a little further
1708130~005060~let's examine and talk about the region of convergence
1713190~003099~all the applause transform and
1716289~004331~how its associated both with properties of the time function
1720620~004039~and also with the location love the polls
1724659~003281~all the applause transform and as we'll see
1727940~003180~the air are some very specific and important
1731120~003320~relationships and conclusions that we can draw
1734440~003180~about how the region of convergence
1737620~003750~is constrained an Associated with the
1741370~004480~locations the polls in the ass point
1745850~004049~well to begin with we can
1749899~003390~of course make the statement as I just made
1753289~003990~that the region of convergence contains no polls
1757279~003030~in particular if I think
1760309~003781~love this general rational function
1764090~004600~the polls love XFS by the values evas
1768690~003329~at which the denominator 0 or equivalent Lee
1772019~003431~XFS blows up and of course
1775450~005530~then that implies that the expression is no longer converged
1780980~003890~okay well that's one statement that we can make now there
1784870~004029~are some others and one for example
1788899~003351~is the statement that if I have a point
1792250~003330~in the S plane that corresponds the convergence
1795580~003680~then in fact any line in the S plane
1799260~003350~with that same real part will also
1802610~004000~be said %uh values for which the apostrophes form converges
1806610~003809~and what's the reason for that the reason for that
1810419~004521~is dead s is Sigma plus J Omega
1814940~005739~and convergence all the applause transform is associated with
1820679~003870~convergence love the four EA transform all
1824549~003630~it to the minus Sigma see times X 50
1828179~003691~and so the convergence only depends on Sigma
1831870~003159~if it only depends on Sigma than
1835029~003221~for one if it converges for one value Sigma
1838250~003700~I'm sorry for what for a value Sigma
1841950~003709~for some valuable maker Danny will converge
1845659~003841~for that same Sigma for any valuable make
1849500~004740~the conclusion n is dead the region of convergence
1854240~003870~if I have a law if I have a point that I also have a line
1858110~003900~and so what that suggests is that as we look at the regional convergence
1862010~007000~in fact corresponds to strips in the complex plane
1869350~003059~now finally we can tie together
1872409~003091~the region of convergence to the
1875500~004789~convergence of the Fourier transform in particular since we know that
1880289~003911~the applause transform reduces
1884200~003199~to the 48 transform when
1887399~005681~the complex variable yes is Sigma is equal to jail maker
1893080~004349~the implication is that if we have the law applies transform
1897429~005531~and if the a-plus transform reduces to the 48 transform
1902960~003800~when sick make 10 in other words when s is equal to jail make a
1906760~003720~then the 4e a transformative exit see
1910480~003250~converging is equivalent to the statement
1913730~003179~that the a-plus transform converges
1916909~004221~for Sigma equal to 0 in other words that the region of convergence
1921130~005049~includes what DJ Omega axis
1926179~004250~in the ass point
1930429~004951~alright so we have then some statements that kinda tied together the location of
1935380~000850~the polls
1936230~004600~and the region convergence let me make one other statement which is
1940830~004430~much harder statement to justify and I won't try to I just simply stated
1945260~004159~and that is that the regional convergence oval plus transform
1949419~003201~is a connected region in other words
1952620~003360~if the entire region
1955980~003890~consists of a single strap in the S plane
1959870~004539~it can consist of a strip over here for example in a strip over there
1964409~006031~well let me let me I'm emphasize summer those points a little further
1970440~004229~let's suppose that I A have
1974669~003120~ale a-plus transform
1977789~003250~and Google+ transform their
1981039~003911~I am talking about is a rational function which is
1984950~004660~one over S plus one times as plus two
1989610~004539~then the poll 0 pattern as its referred to
1994149~003421~in the S play in the location love the roots love the
1997570~004180~numerator and denominator polynomial course there is no numerator polynomial
2001750~005590~the denominator polynomial roots which have represented by these X's
2007340~003020~are shown here and so this is
2010360~003080~the poll 0 pattern
2013440~003469~and from what I said the region of convergence
2016909~003341~can't include any polls
2020250~003159~and it must correspond to strips
2023409~003740~in the ass plane and furthermore it must be
2027149~004481~just want some one connected region rather than multiple regions
2031630~003279~and so with this algebraic expression
2034909~004510~then the possible choices for the region of convergence
2039419~003110~consistent with those properties are the following:
2042529~003030~one of them would be region of convergence
2045559~003921~to the right love this poll
2049480~004850~a second would be a region of convergence
2054330~004470~which lies between the two poles
2058800~003580~as a show here and
2062380~003420~a third is region of convergence
2065800~005400~which is to the left love this poll
2071200~004689~and because it the fact dead I said without proof that
2075889~005290~the region of convergence must be a single strip it can't be multiple strips
2081179~004761~in fact we could not consider as a possible region convergence
2085940~003430~what I show here in so in fact
2089370~003370~this is not a valid region of convergence
2092740~003760~there are only three possibilities Associated
2096500~004440~with this poll 0 pattern namely to the writer this poll
2100940~005570~between the two poles and to the left that this poll
2106510~003080~now to carry the discussion further
2109590~003890~we can in fact associate
2113480~004180~the region of convergence above the law applies transform
2117660~003280~with some very specific characteristics
2120940~005090~of the time function and what this will do is to help us understand
2126030~004020~how various for various choices
2130050~003470~love the region of convergence the interpretation
2133520~003800~that we can impose on the related time function
2137320~003040~let me show you what I mean
2140360~003900~suppose that we start with
2144260~003930~a time function as i indicated here
2148190~003710~which is a finite
2151900~003480~duration time function in other words it's zero
2155380~003320~except in some time interval now
2158700~003790~recall that the Fourier transform converges
2162490~003250~if the time for action has the property
2165740~004620~that is absolutely integral and as long as everything stays finite and
2170360~003430~interns have ample to in a finite duration signal
2173790~004020~there's no difficulty that we're gonna run into here
2177810~004250~now here the Fourier transform will converge and now
2182060~004960~the question is what can we say about the reach of convergence
2187020~003290~of the apostrophe it's for well
2190310~004130~the applies transform is the Fourier transform
2194440~003310~all the time function multiplied by an exponential
2197750~004950~and so we can ask a pan out whether we can destroy the absolute integrability
2202700~001450~of this
2204150~003540~by multiplying by an exponential that the case
2207690~005450~that grows too fast in the case too fast to whatever let's take a look at that
2213140~003150~suppose that this time function
2216290~004100~is absolutely integral and
2220390~003260~let's multiply it by
2223650~005180~a decaying exponential so this is now except eat I'm see the minus Sigma T
2228830~003150~if I think multiplying these two together
2231980~003930~and what you can see is that for negative for positive time
2235910~003140~sort of thinking informally I'm helping
2239050~004580~the integrability of the product because I'm pushing this part down
2243630~004390~for negative time unfortunately I'm making things bro
2248020~005220~but I don't let them grow indefinitely because there's some time before which
2253240~003810~this is equal to 0 likewise
2257050~006260~if I head a growing exponential
2263310~003600~then for a growing exponential
2266910~003240~for negative time or for this part perhaps
2270150~004940~this part making things smaller for positive time eventually this expansion
2275090~000870~was growing without
2275960~005430~found but the time function stocks at some point
2281390~003690~so the idea then kinda is dead
2285080~003490~for a finite duration
2288570~005730~time function no matter what kinda exponential I multiply by whether it's
2294300~003890~going this way are going this way because of the fact that
2298190~004090~essentially the limits on the integral are fine I'd I'm
2302280~004070~guaranteed that'll always maintain absolute integrability
2306350~004550~and so in fact then for a finite duration time function
2310900~005870~the region of convergence is the entire s play
2316770~003010~okay now in we can also
2319780~003680~make statements about other kinds of time functions
2323460~003130~and let's look
2326590~003190~at a time function
2329780~003440~which I a defined as a right-sided
2333220~004190~time function and
2337410~003040~a right-sided time function is one which
2340450~003380~is 0 up until sometime and then
2343830~004220~it goes on after that presumably off to infinity
2348050~003110~now let me remind you that
2351160~003220~the whole issue here with the region of convergence
2354380~003700~has to do with exponentials
2358080~003690~that we can multiply a time function by
2361770~004740~and have the product end up being absolutely integral
2366510~004730~well supposed dead when I multiply this time function
2371240~004190~by an exponential which lets ATK's
2375430~003980~but an exponentially to the minus Sigma 0t
2379410~003330~what you can see me sort of intuitively is dead if
2382740~003220~this product is absolutely integral
2385960~005310~if I would increase Sigma 0 then I'm making things even better for positive
2391270~002370~time because I'm pushing them down
2393640~003660~and whereas they might be worse for negative time
2397300~003750~that doesn't matter because before some time
2401050~005720~the product is equal to 0 so if this product is absolutely an agreeable
2406770~003140~then if are chosen exponential
2409910~003370~it's a minus signal one teeny where signal one
2413280~003340~is greater than 60 then that product
2416620~004170~will also be absolutely integral ball and we can draw
2420790~004640~important conclusion about that about the region of convergence from that
2425430~003100~in particular we can make this statement
2428530~005030~dead if the time function is right sided
2433560~003020~and if convergence
2436580~004530~occurs for some value segment 0
2441110~004710~then in fact we will have convergence of the law applies transform
2445820~003870~for all values all the real party bass
2449690~003020~greater than Sigma 0 the reason
2452710~003870~of course being dead if Sigma 0 increases
2456580~006610~then the exponential DK's even faster for positive time
2463190~004830~now what that says then thinking another way enters the region of convergence
2468020~003320~as we might droid in the ass plane is that
2471340~003310~if we have a point that's in the region of convergence corresponding to some
2474650~001990~value Sigma 0
2476640~003260~band all values evas to the right of that
2479900~004460~in the S plane will also be in the region convergence
2484360~003950~we can also combine that with the statement that for rational functions
2488310~003150~we know dead there can't be any polls
2491460~004020~in the region of convergence if you put those two statements together
2495480~003600~then we end up with a statement dead if
2499080~005740~x50 is right sided and if it's a plus transformers rational
2504820~003770~then the region of convergence is to the right
2508590~003160~up the rightmost poll so
2511750~004360~we have here a very important insight which tells us
2516110~003190~dead weekend im in for some property
2519300~003380~about the time function from the region of convergence
2522680~004330~or conversely if we know something about the time function namely being right
2527010~000940~sided
2527950~004590~then we can infer something about the regional convergence
2532540~003500~well in addition to right-sided
2536040~003470~signals we can also have left sided signals
2539510~004390~Analects I did signal is essentially a right-sided signal turned around
2543900~003090~in other words a left-sided signal is one
2546990~003860~that is zero after some time
2550850~003720~well we can carry out exactly the same kind of argument there
2554570~004040~namely if the signal goes off to infinity in the negative time direction
2558610~000860~and stops
2559470~004870~someplace for positive time if I have an exponential
2564340~004270~I can multiply it by and have that product be absolutely integral ball
2568610~003740~but if I choose an exponential that decays even faster for negative times
2572350~001690~that I'm pushing the stuff
2574040~003160~way out there down even further then
2577200~003640~II enhance the integrability even more
2580840~004380~an you might have to think through that a little bit but it's exactly
2585220~003670~the flip side of the argument for right-sided signals
2588890~003520~and the conclusion and is dead
2592410~004040~if we have a left-sided signal
2596450~004400~and we have a point a value up the real party best which is in the region of
2600850~001210~convergence
2602060~003450~then in fact all values
2605510~003020~to the left at that point in the S plane
2608530~003960~will also be in the region of convergence
2612490~003600~now solar to the statement that we made for right-sided signals
2616090~004640~if expertise left-sided and in fact we're talking about a rational applies
2620730~001540~transform which we most
2622270~004400~typically well then in fact we can make the statement
2626670~003400~there the region of convergence is to the left
2630070~003010~of the leftmost poll because
2633080~003570~we know it has if we find a point that's in the region of convergence
2636650~003220~everything to the left then has to be in the region of convergence
2639870~003690~we can have any polls in the region of convergence you put those two statements
2643560~001120~together and it says
2644680~003020~is to the left the leftmost poll
2647700~004270~now the final situation is the situation where
2651970~003460~we have a signal which is neither right side or left side it goes off to
2655430~001990~infinity for positive time
2657420~004300~and it goes off to infinity for negative time and their the thing to kinda
2661720~001540~recognizes that
2663260~004410~if you multiply by an exponential and its decaying
2667670~004410~very fast for positive time it's gonna be growing very fast for negative time
2672080~004030~conversely if it became very fast for negative time is growing very fast for
2676110~001380~positive time
2677490~004270~and this kind of this notion of trying to balance the value Sigma
2681760~004170~and in effect with that says is that the region of convergence can't
2685930~003260~extent too far to the left or too far to the right
2689190~003640~said another way for a two-sided
2692830~005500~signal and if we have a point which is in the region of convergence
2698330~003410~than that point defines
2701740~003600~strip in the ass plane dead takes
2705340~004630~that point and extends it to the left until you bump into a pole
2709970~005270~an extensive to the right until you bump into a pole
2715240~003620~fight so he you begin today and see that
2718860~003600~we can tie together some properties in the region of convergence
2722460~004520~and the right-sided mister left-sided mister two-sided NIS
2726980~004520~love the time function and you have a chance to examine that
2731500~003520~in more detail in the video course manual
2735020~003490~let's conclude this lecture by talking about
2738510~004450~how we might get the time function
2742960~003080~given the low class transformed
2746040~003640~well if we have a plus transform we can
2749680~003310~in principle get the time function back again by
2752990~003280~recognizing this relationship between the applause transform
2756270~004390~and the 48 transform and using the formal for EA transform expression
2760660~003810~or quietly the formal inverse Laplace transform
2764470~005460~expression which is in the tax but more typically what we would do is
2769930~004390~what we've done also with the Fourier transform
2774320~003290~which is to use simple
2777610~003280~plus transform pairs together with the notion
2780890~003300~all the partial fraction expansion and
2784190~003840~let's just go through that with an example
2788030~003530~let's suppose that I have
2791560~003850~a a-plus transform as i indicated here
2795410~004260~and its polls are applied and a region of convergence which
2799670~004060~is to the right if this poll and what we can identify
2803730~003270~from the region of convergence in fact is that we're talking
2807000~003680~about a right-sided time function
2810680~005220~so the rear richer convergence is the real party best greater than -1
2815900~004280~and now looking down at the algebraic expression
2820180~004410~we have the algebraic expression for this is i indicate here
2824590~004730~acquittal on tlie expanded in a partial fraction expansion
2829320~003920~as a show below so if you just simply combine these together
2833240~003800~that's the same as this and the region of convergence
2837040~004370~is the real party bass greater than -1
2841410~003430~now the region of convergence or
2844840~004320~this is a solid to turn so the the time function is this summer to time
2849160~001170~functions
2850330~003060~and the region of convergence
2853390~004100~all love the combination must be
2857490~004470~the intersection of the region of convergence associated with each one
2861960~004790~recognizing that this is to the right of the polls
2866750~003360~that tells us immediately that each of these two
2870110~003540~then would correspond to bill plus transform
2873650~003520~love a right-sided time function
2877170~003720~well let's look at it term by term
2880890~005040~the first term is the factor 1 over s plus one
2885930~004690~with the region of convergence to the right if this poll
2890620~003830~and this hat algebraically
2894450~003270~corresponds to what i've indicated and this in fact
2897720~003880~is similar to or special case if the
2901600~004100~example that we pointed to at the beginning at the lecture namely example
2905700~001280~9.1
2906980~003650~and so we can just simply use that result if you think back
2910630~003150~to that example or refer to your notes we know
2913780~003260~dead time function of the form
2917040~004690~eat to -80 gives us all a plus transform which is one over S Plus
2921730~003820~a with the real party bass greater than
2925550~004980~minus a and so this is the applause transformer the first
2930530~004790~or sorry this is the inverse the poss transform the first term
2935320~003160~if we now consider the poll add
2938480~003790~s equals -2
2942270~004520~and here is the region of convergence that we originally began with
2946790~004870~in fact we can having removed the pole at -1
2951660~003060~extend this region of convergence
2954720~003660~to this poll and we now have
2958380~004230~an algebraic expression which is -1 over s plus
2962610~003740~to the real party best greater than -1
2966350~003630~although in fact we can extend the region of convergence
2969980~003640~up to the poll and the inverse
2973620~003180~transformer this is now again
2976800~004030~referring to the same example minus you to the -2 T
2980830~003940~times a unit step and if we simply
2984770~003880~put the two turns together then
2988650~004690~adding the one that we have here to what we had before
2993340~003770~we have a total inverse Laplace transform
2997110~003750~which is that
3000860~003280~so essentially what's happened is dead
3004140~003690~each of the ex each over the polls has contributed
3007830~004430~an exponential factor and because if the region of convergence
3012260~003100~being to the right of all those polls that
3015360~005250~is consistent with the notion that both of those terms correspond to right-sided
3020610~002250~time functions
3022860~003020~well it's just the focus for
3025880~003360~for a second or two on the same
3029240~005030~Posey role pattern but instead I love
3034270~003680~a region of convergence which is to the right at the polls
3037950~004080~as we had before well now take a region of convergence which is between the two
3042030~001250~poles
3043280~003700~and I'll let you work through this more leisurely
3046980~005920~in the video course manual but when we carry out the partial fraction expansion
3052900~003040~as I've done below
3055940~004040~we would now associate with this poll
3059980~003720~a regional convergence to the right with this poll
3063700~003520~a region of convergence to the left
3067220~003340~and so while what we would have
3070560~004970~is the sum love a right-sided time function due to this poll
3075530~003070~and in fact that serve the form you to the minus T
3078600~004090~pretty positive and a left-sided
3082690~003620~type function due to this poll
3086310~003260~and in fact that serve the form in the minus two TV
3089570~003390~pretty negative and so in fact
3092960~003810~the answer that we will get when we decompose this
3096770~003580~use the partial fraction expansion being very careful
3100350~003340~about associating the region of convergence
3103690~003550~this poll to the right and if this poll to the left
3107240~003370~will have then when we're all done a time
3110610~003660~function which will be of the form eats the minus
3114270~004440~T times a unit step pretty positive
3118710~003670~and then we'll have a term of the for me
3122380~004800~to the I'm sorry this would-be to the minus 2 T's since this is at -2 in this
3127180~000280~is
3127460~004150~-1 this would be a plus sign in this would be minus
3131610~003690~you to the minus the for TE negative
3135300~003920~and you look at that a little more carefully when
3139220~005720~I you sit down with the video course manual
3144940~003750~okay well what we've gone through rather quickly is
3148690~003780~an introduction to the applause transform
3152470~003760~and a couple points to underscore again
3156230~004710~is the fact that the applause transform is very closely associated
3160940~004590~with the Fourier transform and in fact the applause transform
3165530~004070~4s equals jail maker reduces to the 48 transform
3169600~005050~but more generally the a-plus transform is the 48 transform
3174650~003200~love x50 with
3177850~006070~an exponential weighting and there are some exponentials for which that product
3183920~003250~converges there are other exponentials for which
3187170~003620~that product has a Fourier transform that doesn't converge
3190790~004620~bad then imposes on the discussion above plus transform
3195410~003430~what we refer to as the region of convergence
3198840~005960~and it's very important to understand that in specifying a a-plus transform
3204800~003880~it's important to identify not only
3208680~004870~the algebraic expression but also the values the best namely
3213550~003040~for which it it's valid namely
3216590~005490~the region of convergence low class transformed finally what we did was to
3222080~003470~tied together some properties over time function
3225550~003910~with things that we can say about the regional convergence office supplies
3229460~002560~transform
3232020~004840~now just as with the Fourier transform the applause transformer has some very
3236860~004320~important properties and I love these properties both
3241180~005020~are some mechanisms for using a fast transforming
3246200~004740~for such such systems as linear cut those described by a linear cut the
3250940~001340~coefficient
3252280~003340~differential equations but more importantly
3255620~005070~the properties will help us as we understand the further
3260690~003940~will help us in using exploiting
3264630~004740~the appliance transform to study and understand
3269370~003000~linear time-invariant systems and
3272370~003700~thats what will go on to next time in particular
3276070~003830~talking about properties and then associating
3279900~003700~with linear time-invariant systems much of the discussion
3283600~003020~dead we've had today relating
3286620~001680~to the austrians 1 thank you
