the norm

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,680 
are

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,830 
the in the last two lectures

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,230 
and we saw how periodic not periodic
signals could be represented as linear

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,630 
combinations a complex exponentials

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,390 
and this led to the Fourier series
representation

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,290 
in the periodic case and it led to the
Fourier transform

19
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,960 
representation in the a periodic case
and and then in fact

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,250 
what we did was to incorporate the 4e a
series

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,890 
within the framework of the Fourier
transform what I'd like to do in today's

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,070 
lecture is

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,520 
look at the 4-yard transform more
closely

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,680 
in particular with regard to so this
property's

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,890 
so let me begin by reminding you

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,180 
love the analysis and synthesis
equations for the four th

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,369 
transform and as I summarize them here

28
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,470 
the synthesis equation being a

29
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,880 
an equation that tells us how to build
the

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,819 
time function outta in essence a linear
combination

31
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,350 
a complex exponentials and the analysis
equation

32
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,330 
telling us how to get the amplitudes
love those complex exponentials

33
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,360 
from the Associated time function

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,710 
so essentially in the decomposition

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,090 
affect safety as a linear combination of
complex exponentials

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,550 
the complex amplitudes if those are in
effect

37
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,590 
the 48 transform scaled by

38
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,720 
the differential and scaled by one over
two-part

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,200 
now as

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,120 
I indicated last time the 48 transform

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,830 
is a complex function of frequency in

42
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,160 
and in particular the complex function
of frequency

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,140 
has an important and very useful
cemetery property

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,370 
the symmetry love the Fourier transform

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,890 
when X if T is real is

46
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,900 
what is referred to as conjugate
symmetric in other words if we take the

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,760 
complex

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,610 
function after Omega and and its complex
conjugate

49
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,830 
that's equivalent to replacing Omega

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,970 
by minus Omega and a consequence if that

51
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,280 
if we think interns love the real party
the Fourier transform

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,460 
the real part is and even function of
frequency

53
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,780 
and the magnet to is an even function of
frequency

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,380 
whereas the imaginary part is an

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,240 
odd function of frequency and the phase
angle

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,740 
is an odd function of frequency so

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,110 
we have this symmetry relationship that
for except the real

58
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,890 
if we think I've either the real part or
the magnitude of the Fourier transform

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,930 
its even symmetric and the imaginary
part

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,340 
or the phase angle either one it is

61
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,310 
fought symmetric in other words if we
flip it we multiply by a minus sign

62
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,670 
let's didn't look at an example

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,570 
in the context love an example that we
worked last time

64
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,400 
for the Fourier transform we took

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,620 
the case both a real exponential

66
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,570 
love the form eat to the -80 times this
step

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,390 
and the 48 transform as

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,759 
we found was other algebraic form one
over a plus J Omega

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,470 
and incidently the 48 transform into
grow only converged

70
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,669 
for a greater than 0 in other words

71
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,750 
for this exponential became and I
illustrated

72
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,240 
the magnitude and angle and what we see
is that

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,259 
you the minus 8c is a real

74
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,360 
time function therefore its magnitude

75
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,110 
should be an even function of frequency
and indeed it is

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,360 
and its phase angle shown below

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,069 
is and odd function of frequency

78
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,620 
so in fact in although

79
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,910 
I stressed last time that

80
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,970 
the complex exponentials required to
build the time function

81
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,730 
require exponentials both positive and
negative frequencies

82
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,780 
for except the real what we see is that

83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,070 
because if the symmetry properties
either for the real and imaginary or

84
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,820 
magnitude and angle

85
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,639 
we can specify a before you transform
for let's say only positive frequencies

86
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,960 
and asymmetry then implies are tells us

87
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,120 
what the Fourier transform then will be
for the negative frequencies

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,410 
okay now this same example the cause

89
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,420 
the decaying exponential demonstrates

90
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,620 
another important and often useful

91
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,350 
property the Fourier transform

92
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,860 
specifically let's rewrite algebraically
this example

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,630 
as I indicate here so we have

94
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,810 
again the exponential was 48
transformers one over a plus J Omega

95
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,810 
and if I A just simply divide numerator
and denominator by a

96
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,370 
I can rewrite it in the form shown here

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,680 
and what we notice is dead in the time
function

98
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,250 
we have a term of the form eight times
TV

99
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,389 
and in the frequency function we have a
term for the form Omega

100
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:25,570 
divided by a or

101
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,730 
equivalent Lee we can't think all the

102
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,639 
time function which I show here

103
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,740 
and as the pram enter a gets smaller

104
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,310 
the exponential gets spread out in time

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,790 
whereas s04e08 transform

106
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,280 
or the magnitude of its Fourier
transform has the inverse property

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400 
that as a get smaller in fact

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,840 
this scales down in frequency

109
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,880 
well this is a general property love

110
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,919 
the Fourier transform namely the fact

111
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,360 
that a a linear scaling a time

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,600 
generates the infers linear scaling a
frequency

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,510 
and the general statement love this time
frequency scaling is what

114
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,980 
I show at the top above the transparency
namely the equation

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,460 
that if we scale the time function in
time

116
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,699 
then we apply and infers scaling a
frequency

117
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,960 
now her this in fact is probably a
result

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,210 
that you're already possibly familiar
with in

119
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,080 
somewhat of a different context
essentially you can think of this

120
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,040 
as an example poor generalization rather

121
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,699 
up the notion that if let's say I A

122
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,150 
had a signal that was recorded on a tape
player

123
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,669 
and if I play the tape back and let's
say twice the speed which means that I'm

124
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,760 
compressing the time axis

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,260 
linearly by a factor of two then in fact
what happens is that

126
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,949 
the frequencies that we observe get
pushed up by a factor of two

127
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,070 
and effect let me illustrate that

128
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,630 
I have here a glockenspiel

129
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,620 
and anyone who loves a parade certainly
knows what I each

130
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,699 
blockage feel as and

131
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,050 
this particular glockenspiel has

132
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,620 
3 eighties separated each by an active
there's a middle way

133
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,969 
a high a us and a low a

134
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,490 
and what I've done is to record

135
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,230 
the middle a on a tape

136
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,160 
at seven and a half inches per second
and

137
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,170 
what I'd like to demonstrate is that as

138
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,550 
we play that back either a cloister
half-speed

139
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,639 
the effective note gets moved down or up
by a doctor

140
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,829 
so let me first play the note at

141
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,980 
the speed at which was recorded and so
what we'll hear

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,730 
is the middle a as i've recorded it and
let me just start

143
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,730 
the tape player

144
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:29,459 
okay let me stop it and hopefully what
you heard is the

145
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,680 
same note from the tape recorder as

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,560 
the note that I played on the
glockenspiel okay well now

147
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,769 
a rewind the tape and we go back to the
beginning

148
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,759 
love that portion and

149
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,040 
now if I change the tapes the to

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,980 
half the speed so from seven and a half
inches per second

151
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,980 
a change the tape speed 233 quarter

152
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,779 
inches per second and now

153
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,889 
when I play the tape back because effect
because

154
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,860 
love the inverse relationship between
time and frequency scaling we're now

155
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,589 
scaling in time by stretching out we
would expect the frequencies to be

156
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,160 
lowered

157
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,600 
by a factor of two we should now expect
the

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,170 
taped no to be an octave lower

159
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:26,170 
matching the slower a so let's just play
that okay let me stop it

160
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,000 
and again will rewind the tape

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,430 
go back to

162
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,509 
the beginning and now will play this at

163
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,819 
twice the speed so I change from three
and three-quarters

164
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:59,569 
to 15 inches per second and now and I
play it we would expect that

165
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:06,569 
to match the upper no and let's just do
that Ste

166
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,290 
us

167
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,490 
us okay well

168
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,450 
although thats a result that intuitively
probably

169
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,110 
makes considerable sense in fact what
that is

170
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,180 
is an illustration love the inverse
relationship between

171
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,610 
time scaling frequency scaling and also
by the way it was finally my opportunity

172
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,170 
to play the glockenspiel on television
okayed now

173
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,640 
in in addition their is another

174
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,520 
very important relationship between the
time and frequency domains

175
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,760 
namely what is referred to as a

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,000 
duality relationship and

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,990 
the duality relationship between time
and frequency

178
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,260 
falls out more less directly from

179
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,220 
the equations the analysis and synthesis
equations in particular if we look at

180
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,770 
the

181
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,650 
synthesis equation which I repeat here

182
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,900 
and the analysis equation which I repeat
below it

183
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,460 
what we observe is dead in fact

184
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,200 
these equations are basically identical

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,890 
except for the fact that in the top

186
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,500 
integral we have things as a function of
Omega in the bottom integral as a

187
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750 
function of T

188
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,990 
and there's a factor of 10 ver tu Pai
and by the way a minus sign

189
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,030 
well you can look at the algebra

190
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,110 
more carefully at your leisure but
especially with this says

191
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,350 
is that if excessive Omega is

192
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,330 
the Fourier transform over type function
exit see

193
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,780 
then in fact except Amy

194
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:00,140 
is very much like the Fourier transform
affective Omega

195
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,820 
in fact it's the Fourier transform
attacks have minus Omega

196
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,550 
to account for this minus sign and by
the way there's just an additional

197
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,360 
factor

198
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,880 
one over 25 so the duality relationship
which

199
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,270 
follows from these two equations in fact

200
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,510 
says that if x50

201
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,190 
an ex vivo maker are a4e a transformed
pair

202
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,940 
if little accent capital XR Fourier
transform pair

203
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,620 
then capital lacks in fact has a $4 EA
transform

204
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,470 
which is proportional a little lax
turned around well

205
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,070 
this to outdo ality in the continuous
time Fourier transform

206
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,770 
is very important it's very useful it by
the way is not

207
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,220 
duality that surface in a forty a series
because as you recall the 48 series

208
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,870 
begins with a continuous-time function

209
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,950 
and in the frequency domain generates a
sequence

210
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,660 
which with just naturally have the
proper have

211
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,670 
problems associated with it if we
attempted to

212
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,840 
interpreted to ality and we'll see also:

213
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,480 
that in a discrete-time case one of the
important differences between

214
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,610 
continuous-time and discrete-time
Fourier transforms

215
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,810 
is the fact that in continuous-time we
have to our the

216
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,320 
in discrete-time for then the
discrete-time Fourier transform we don't

217
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,740 
well

218
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,110 
let's indicate illustrate this with an
example

219
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,870 
in here are in fact two examples

220
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,770 
a Fourier transform pairs taken from
examples in the text

221
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,230 
to the top one being example

222
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,420 
four-point 11 from the tax and it's a
time for action

223
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,460 
which is a sin 0 X over X type a
function

224
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,550 
and its Fourier transform

225
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,580 
corresponds to a

226
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,660 
rectangular shape in the frequency
domain there's also

227
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,580 
another example in the text the example
the preseason this one

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,470 
which is example four-point 10 and an
example four point 10

229
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,970 
we begin with a rectangle

230
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,250 
and its Fourier transform is love the
form

231
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,110 
all a sin x over X function

232
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,190 
so in fact if we look at these to

233
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,930 
examples together what we see is

234
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,210 
the duality very evident in other words

235
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,660 
if we take this time function and

236
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,650 
instead think i've a frequency function
that has the same form

237
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,260 
then we simply interchange the rolls a
time-frequency

238
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,330 
in the other domains so the fact that
these to correspond

239
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,360 
means that these two cars find

240
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,670 
course and in this particular example

241
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,160 
we because it the fact that we picked a
symmetric function even function

242
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,450 
in fact the additional twist love the
time axis being reversed didn't show up

243
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,820 
in her in duality with this example

244
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,940 
now one thing he says of course is that
essentially

245
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,190 
anytime you've calculated

246
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,430 
the 48 transform a one-time function

247
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,150 
then you actually calculate the Fourier
transform

248
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,300 
to type functions another one being

249
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,370 
the dual example to the one that you
just calculated

250
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,540 
now also somewhat related to do our the

251
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,220 
is what is referred to as parce balls

252
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,620 
relation for the continuous-time Fourier
transform

253
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,130 
and essentially what parts are false
relationship says

254
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,570 
is that as kind of a a summary other

255
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,060 
it says dead the energy

256
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,410 
in a time function and the energy

257
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,160 
in its Fourier transform are
proportional the proportionality factor

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,960 
being a factor of two pi

259
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,280 
it well that summarized here what's
meant by the energy

260
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,970 
is course the ago the magnitude squared
effect City

261
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,959 
and the statement apart the balls
relation and is dead

262
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,190 
that in a brawl the energy and accept T

263
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,720 
is proportional to this integral which
is the energy

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,920 
indexable Megan now

265
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,490 
although we've incorporated the 4e a
series

266
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,610 
within a framework for the Fourier
transform parcels relation

267
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,670 
needs to be modified slightly for

268
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,070 
for a series because the fact that
periodic signal

269
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,440 
has an infinite amount of energy and its
and essentially

270
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,530 
that former parcels relationship for the
periodic case would say

271
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,730 
infinity equals infinity which isn't too
useful

272
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,480 
however can be modified so that part's a
false relationship for the periodic case

273
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,910 
says essentially that the energy E

274
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,010 
in one period other periodic time
function

275
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,360 
in is proportional with this is the
proportionality factor

276
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,770 
proportional to the sum %uh the
magnitude squared

277
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,950 
up the coefficients in other words the
energy in one period

278
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,600 
is proportional to the energy in the
sequence

279
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,800 
that represents the four EA series
coefficients

280
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,950 
now okay there are lots of other
properties

281
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,310 
and there developed in the text in the
study guide

282
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,300 
a number a properties that we want to
make particular you so

283
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,620 
during this lecture and in later
lectures

284
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,160 
are ones that I summarize here and

285
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,400 
I won't demonstrate the proves but

286
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,870 
a principally focus on some with the
interpretation is the lecture goes on

287
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,520 
well in the first property that I have
listed here's what's referred to as the

288
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,760 
time shifting property

289
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,520 
and the time shifting property says if I
have a time function

290
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,270 
with a Fourier transform mexico maker

291
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,550 
if I shift that time function in time

292
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,460 
dan that corresponds to multiplying

293
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,550 
the 48 transformed by this factor

294
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,220 
now as you examine this factor what you
can see is that

295
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,460 
this factor has magnitude unity

296
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,100 
and it has a phase which is linear with
frequency

297
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,270 
and is slow %uh minus 20

298
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,610 
so a statement to remember that will
come up

299
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,130 
many times throughout the cores

300
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,480 
is that a timeshare after a displacement
in time

301
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,300 
corresponds to linear phase

302
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,250 
or change in linear phase earlier change
in phase and frequency

303
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,730 
another property in and in fact a pair
of properties

304
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,300 
that will make reference to as we turn
our attention toward the end of this

305
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,950 
lecture to

306
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,790 
solving differential equations using the
Fourier transform

307
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,240 
is hit was referred to as the
differentiation property

308
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,720 
and its companion which is the
integration property

309
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,420 
the differentiation property says again
if we have

310
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,740 
a time function whose with Fourier
transform mexico maker

311
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,350 
the Fourier transform up the time
derivative that

312
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,340 
is in corresponds to multiplying the
Fourier transform

313
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,760 
by a linear function of frequency so

314
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,370 
here it's a linear able to change dead

315
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,590 
that corresponds to differentiation

316
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,480 
now at first glance what you might think
is that

317
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,770 
the integration property is just the
reverse if that if

318
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,430 
for the differentiation property you
multiply by J Omega then

319
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,750 
for integration you must abide by jail
maker and thats almost correct

320
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,600 
except not quite and the reason for the
not quite

321
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,550 
is that recall that if you differentiate

322
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,110 
what happens of course is that you lose
a constant

323
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,310 
and if we have a time function thats
some fun and energy signal plus a

324
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,310 
constant

325
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,900 
differentiating will destroy the
constant

326
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,450 
and integration the immigration property
in essence tries to bring that back

327
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,630 
so the integration property which is the
inverse

328
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,540 
of the differentiation property says
that we divide

329
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,250 
the transformed by J Omega and then

330
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,390 
if in fact their was a constant added to
accept T

331
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,460 
we have to account for that by inserting
an impulse

332
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,240 
into the Fourier transform and

333
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,510 
the file property that I want to draw
your attention to

334
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,950 
on this you graph is the linearity
property

335
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,840 
which is very straight forward to
demonstrate from

336
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,790 
the analysis and synthesis equations
which simply said is

337
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,260 
if X 100 maker is the Fourier transform
X 1ft

338
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,310 
and x2 Omega is the Fourier transform X
2ft

339
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,040 
then the Fourier transform a linear
combination is

340
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,860 
a linear combination love the Fourier
transforms

341
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,000 
now let me emphasize also that these
properties for the most part

342
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,490 
apply both 240 a series and Fourier
transforms

343
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,470 
because in fact and what we've done is
to incorporate

344
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,860 
the forty a series within the

345
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,600 
framework of the Fourier transform

346
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,540 
okay now will be using a number of these
properties shortly when we turn our

347
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540 
attention to

348
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,050 
near-constant coefficient differential
equations however before we do that I'd

349
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,250 
like to

350
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,250 
focus on two additional

351
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,560 
major properties and

352
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,770 
these are what are referred to as the
convolution property and the modulation

353
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,930 
property

354
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,180 
and in fact the convolution property as
I'm about

355
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,660 
to introduces forms the

356
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,010 
mathematical and conceptual basis for

357
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,510 
the whole notion of filtering which in
fact will be

358
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,350 
a topic by itself in a set of lectures
and

359
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,820 
and in fact is a chapter by itself in
the textbook

360
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,400 
similarly what i'll refer to as the
modulation property

361
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,480 
again well occupy its own set

362
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,740 
have lectures as we go through this
scores and in fact has its own

363
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,460 
a chapter in the textbook

364
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,750 
let me in just indicate what the
convolution property is

365
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,280 
and and what the convolution property

366
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,660 
tells us is that

367
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,640 
the 48 transform of the convolution

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,470 
a two-time functions is the product

369
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,950 
all therefore yea transforms

370
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,950 
so it says for example dead

371
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,580 
if I have a linear time-invariant system

372
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,510 
and in I have an input exits the an
impulse response HFT

373
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,620 
and the output of course being the
convolution

374
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,120 
then in fact if I look at this in the
frequency domain

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,180 
the Fourier transform up the output

376
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,910 
is the for EA transform the input

377
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,460 
times the Fourier transform the impulse
response

378
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,910 
now you can demonstrate this property

379
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,170 
algebraically by essentially taking the
convolution integral

380
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,580 
and applying to 48 transforming doing
the appropriate

381
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,700 
in a changing the order integration et
cetera

382
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,660 
but who what I'd like to draw your
attention to is a

383
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,870 
somewhat more intuitive interpretation
of the property

384
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,290 
and the intuitive interpretations stems
from

385
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,490 
the relationship between the Fourier
transform at the impulse response

386
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,140 
and what we refer to as the frequency
response

387
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,150 
now recall dead wanna have

388
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,200 
the things that lettuce to use complex
exponentials as building blocks

389
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,440 
was the fact that there I can functions
linear time-invariant systems in other

390
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,510 
words

391
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,890 
if we have linear time-invariant system

392
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,120 
and I have an input which is a complex
exponential

393
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,350 
the output is a complex exponential the
same frequency

394
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,820 
multiplied by what we call the frequency
response

395
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,510 
and in fact the expression for the
frequency response

396
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,030 
is identical to the expression for the
four EA transform the impulse response

397
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,290 
in other words the frequency response is

398
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:16,040 
the Fourier transform of the impulse
response

399
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,800 
now in that context how can we

400
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,480 
interpret the convolution property well

401
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,030 
remember what I said at the beginning
the lecture 1 I've pointed

402
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,170 
to the synthesis equation and I said in

403
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,940 
in essence the synthesis equation tells
us

404
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,190 
how to decompose x50 as a linear
combination a complex exponentials

405
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,310 
what are the complex amplitudes are
those complex exponentials

406
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,990 
well interns love our notation year

407
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,290 
the complex amplitude of those complex
exponentials

408
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,030 
is Xserve Omega or proportional taxable
make in particular taxable make a deal

409
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,650 
maker

410
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,640 
and then a factor two-part well

411
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,940 
as this signal goes through this linear
time-invariant system

412
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,390 
what happens to each of those
exponentials is

413
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,530 
it each one gets multiplied by the
frequency response

414
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,530 
at The Associated frequency

415
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,770 
what comes out is the amplitude

416
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,480 
all the complex exponentials that are
used

417
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,910 
to bill the output

418
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,060 
so in fact the convolution property

419
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,310 
simply is telling us

420
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,050 
that interns have a decomposition the
signal

421
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,110 
enters a complex exponentials as we push
that signal through linear

422
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,370 
time-invariant system

423
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,530 
were separately modifying with the
frequency response were multiplying

424
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,120 
by the frequency response the amplitudes

425
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,179 
love the exponential comp phones used to
build the input

426
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:01,250 
and that song intern is

427
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,800 
the decomposition of the output in terms
of complex exponentials

428
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,060 
now and I I understand that kinda going
through that involves

429
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,990 
a little bit of sorting out and I
strongly encourage you

430
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:21,050 
to try to understand and interpret the
convolution property

431
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,919 
in knows conceptual terms rather than
simply by

432
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,830 
applying the mathematics to the
convolution integral and seeing that

433
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,460 
terms match up on both sides

434
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,600 
now as i indicated the convolution
property

435
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,850 
forms the basis for what's referred to
as filtering

436
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,380 
and this is a topic that will be
treating a

437
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,510 
considerable amount of detail and after

438
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,510 
we've also gone through a discussion
love the discrete-time Fourier transform

439
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,870 
in the next several lectures however
what I'd like to do is just

440
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,950 
just indicate now a little bit love

441
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,050 
the conceptual ideas involve

442
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:09,320 
essentially conceptually what filtering
as its

443
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,560 
typically referred to corresponds to

444
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,800 
is modifying separately

445
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,340 
the individual frequency components in a
signal

446
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,140 
the convolution property told us that if
we

447
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,419 
look at the individual frequency comp
points they get multiplied by the

448
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,460 
frequency response and so what that says
is that we can amplify or it anyway

449
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,880 
any of those comp own it separately
using a linear time-invariant system

450
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,060 
for example what I've illustrated here
is

451
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,909 
the frequency response what is commonly
referred to

452
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:52,600 
as and ideal Lopez filter what an ideal
0 pass filter does

453
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,919 
is to pass exactly

454
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,350 
frequencies in one frequency range

455
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,659 
and eliminate totally frequencies
outside that range

456
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,010 
another filter which is not so ideal
might for example

457
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,580 
attenuate sit com phone it's in this
band but not

458
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,179 
I rather attenuate conference in this
band but not totally eliminate them

459
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,200 
now interns a filtering we can think
back

460
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,870 
to the differentiation property and in
fact interpreter

461
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,570 
differentiation or differentiator as a
filter

462
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,030 
recall that the differentiation property
said

463
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:39,280 
that the Fourier transform all the
differentiated signal

464
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,149 
is the for a transformer the original
signal multiplied by J Omega

465
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,210 
so what that says then

466
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,460 
is dead if we have a differentiator
opened the frequency response to that

467
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,700 
is J Omega in other words the Fourier
transform of the output is Jay Omega

468
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,429 
times the Fourier transform the input

469
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:04,280 
and so the frequency response a
differentiator

470
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,350 
looks like this and turns its magnitude
and what it does

471
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,370 
of course is it amplifies high
frequencies

472
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,280 
and attenuates low frequencies

473
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,409 
well let me just to kinda cement summer
these ideas

474
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:26,500 
illustrate them in a context 0

475
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,980 
one kind of signal namely signal which
in fact

476
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,190 
is the spatial signal rather than a time
signal

477
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,550 
and this also gives me an opportunity to
introduce you

478
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,450 
to our colleague JBJ for EA's

479
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,710 
so if we could look at our colleague
mister four EA

480
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,090 
who by the way is on

481
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,020 
not only person who had tremendously
brilliant insights

482
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,210 
and his insights in fact have led to

483
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,240 
the developments really for the
foundation the developments that

484
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,909 
is the basis for this course he was also
a very interesting fascinating person

485
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,179 
and there's a certain amount of
historical discussion

486
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:17,419 
about for EA and his background which
you might enjoy reading in the text

487
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,820 
in any case what you're looking at a
course is a signal

488
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,310 
and the signal is a spatial signal and

489
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,370 
it has high frequencies and low
frequencies high frequencies

490
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,300 
corresponding to things that are varying
rapidly

491
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,470 
spatially and low frequencies barings

492
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,669 
very slowly spatially it so

493
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,120 
for example we could low-pass filter

494
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,520 
this picture simply by asking

495
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,740 
the video crew if they could slightly
defocus

496
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,440 
and what you see as the picture is the
focus if you can hold it there

497
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,550 
is dead we've lost edges which

498
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,610 
is the rapid variation and what we've
retained is the broader

499
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,820 
slow variation and now let's take out

500
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,230 
the d focusing low-pass filter and go
back

501
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:16,980 
to a focused image

502
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,190 
okay now what

503
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,540 
and we can also consider is what would
happen if we look

504
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,389 
at the differentiated image and their
are several ways that we can think about

505
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,530 
this

506
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:33,020 
one is that a differentiator of course
the output of a differentiator

507
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,730 
is larger where the discontinuity

508
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,740 
or where the variation is faster

509
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,820 
and so we would expect the edges

510
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,870 
to be enhanced if in fact we
differentiated the image

511
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,560 
or if we interpret differentiation in
the context

512
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,630 
love our filter then what we're saying

513
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,510 
if hey what we're saying is that in
effect

514
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,450 
what's happening is that the
differentiator is

515
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,540 
accentuating the high frequencies

516
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,220 
because if the frequency shape the
differentiator now recall that this all

517
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,250 
kinda fits together is a nice package

518
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,340 
be expected to actively the
differentiation will enhance ages

519
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,030 
when we talked about square waves and we
so I have a for a series built up a

520
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,080 
square wave

521
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,280 
we saw that it was the high frequencies

522
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,590 
that were required in order to build up
the sharp

523
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,570 
edges and so either viewed as a filter
or viewed intuitively

524
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,950 
we would expect that the differentiated
image would in fact

525
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,649 
get would in fact it anyway the slowly
varying background and amplify

526
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,810 
the rapidly varying ages so let's look
again at

527
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,889 
our original image just to remind you
love the fact that there are edges of

528
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,020 
course and their

529
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,770 
is more slowly varying backgrounds

530
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,040 
and now let's look at the

531
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,120 
result love passing that through

532
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,480 
a differentiator and as i think is

533
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,050 
very evident in that in the resulting
image

534
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,600 
clearly is the edges that a retained and

535
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,770 
the slow back to slower background
variations

536
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,770 
are destroyed which is consistent with
everything we've said

537
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,640 
okay now i've emphasized the her will be
returning

538
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,850 
to a much broader discussion a filtering
at

539
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,480 
a later point in the cores right now
like to comment on another

540
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,830 
property which here is also as i
indicated a topic I've

541
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,070 
in its own right and which really is the
dual

542
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,040 
property to the convolution property and
in fact could be argued directly from

543
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,670 
duality

544
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,080 
and that is what's referred to as the
modulation property

545
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,010 
now the convolution property told us
that

546
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,260 
if we convolved in the time domain we
multiply in the frequency domain

547
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,400 
and we know the time and frequency
domains are interchangeable because it

548
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,250 
to our the

549
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,260 
so what that would suggest is dead

550
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,820 
if we multiply in the time domain

551
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,400 
that would correspond to convolution in
the frequency domain

552
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,760 
and in fact head that is exactly what
the modulation property is

553
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,240 
I have a summarized here that if we
multiply

554
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,450 
a time function by another time function
then

555
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,170 
in the frequency domain week involved

556
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,900 
whereas the convolution property is just
the duel at that

557
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,010 
namely convolved being in the time
domain corresponds to

558
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,340 
multiplication in the frequency domain

559
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:54,340 
the convolution property is the basis as
i indicated for filtering

560
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,780 
the modulation property as I've
summarized it here

561
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,160 
in fact is the entire basis

562
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,210 
for amplitude modulation systems issues

563
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,910 
almost universally in communications and
wait

564
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,650 
the modulation property is we'll see
when we explored in more detail

565
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,710 
tells us is that if we have a signal
with a certain spectrum

566
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,940 
and we multiply by a sinusoidal

567
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,740 
signal whose for EA transformers said
impulses

568
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,320 
then in a frequency-domain week involved
and that corresponds

569
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,040 
to taking the original spectrum and
translating it

570
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,150 
shifting it in frequency up to

571
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,550 
the frequency love the carrier namely

572
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,690 
the sinusoidal signal and as I said will

573
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:52,300 
come to that in much more detail in a
number of lectures

574
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,580 
okay now we've seen a number of
properties

575
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,620 
and I indicated sometime earlier when we
talked about

576
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,910 
and differential equations that in fact
it's the properties are the 48 transform

577
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,450 
that providers with a very useful

578
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,230 
an important mechanism for solving
linear constant coefficient differential

579
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,710 
equations

580
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,800 
and but I'd like to do now

581
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,000 
is illustrate the procedure the basis
for that

582
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,850 
and I think what we'll do is illustrated
simply in the context of several

583
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,210 
examples

584
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,900 
okay well in what i've indicated is

585
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,120 
a system

586
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,140 
with her a an impulse response HFT

587
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,200 
or frequency response teachable nigga
and of course we know that in the time

588
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,610 
domain it's just right to convolution

589
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:54,140 
in the frequency domain its described
through multiplication

590
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,160 
and I in essence

591
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,710 
am assuming that we're talking about a
linear time-invariant system

592
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,540 
and we're also going to assume that it's
characterized by a win here comes the

593
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,070 
coefficient differential equation

594
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,550 
where we're going to oppose the
condition

595
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,880 
that its causal linear and
time-invariant

596
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,110 
or equivalent Lee that the initial
condition conditions

597
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,680 
are consistent with initial rest

598
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,190 
and it's because it the fact that we're
assuming

599
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,340 
that is a linear time-invariant system
that

600
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,390 
we can describe it in the frequency
domain through the convolution property

601
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,250 
and we can use the properties love the
forty a transfer

602
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,200 
so let's take as our example a
first-order differential equation

603
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,930 
as I indicate here so the derivative the
output plus eight times the output is

604
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,910 
equal to the input

605
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:57,380 
and now we can use the differentiation
property

606
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,340 
if we for EA transform mystic entire
expression

607
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,330 
the differentiation property tells us
that

608
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,660 
the forty a transformer the derivative
of the output

609
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:14,720 
is the for a transformer the output
multiplied by J Omega

610
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,810 
and Lenny arity well let us

611
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,130 
right the Fourier transform love this as
eight times while Omega

612
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,520 
and since these are added together and
since we have the linear

613
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,660 
linearity property these are added
together

614
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,900 
and XOM Omega is and the Fourier
transform affect safety

615
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,510 
so what we've used is the
differentiation property

616
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:47,190 
and reviews the when the arity property

617
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,340 
right now weekend solve this equation

618
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,230 
for y Omega the forty a transformer the
output

619
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,920 
in terms of Xserve Omega the Fourier
transform

620
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,800 
the input and a simple algebraic step

621
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,220 
gets s to this expression so the for a
chance for the output is one over

622
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,650 
Jamaica plus a

623
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,200 
ties the forty a transformer the input
and I just simply repeated

624
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,990 
that equation appear

625
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,440 
now so far this is algebra

626
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,840 
and and question is now how do we
interpret this

627
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,710 
well we know that the for a transformer
the output

628
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,680 
is the forty a transformer the input
times the Fourier transform

629
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,140 
are the impulse response to the system
namely the frequency response

630
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,270 
so in fact if we think love

631
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,510 
a chip tanh Omega as a Fourier transform
pair

632
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,010 
then is the convolution property that
lets us

633
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,230 
quaid this term with

634
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,950 
H Omega so here

635
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:05,490 
were using the convolution property

636
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,900 
and so we know what the 48 transform

637
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,040 
or the impulse responses they only one
over

638
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,870 
J Omega plus a now

639
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,760 
in we may have for example what is in
our problem

640
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,080 
instead of getting the frequency
response to get the impulse response

641
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,620 
and there are a variety of ways that we
can't do this we can attempt to go

642
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,980 
through the inverse Fourier transform
expression

643
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,610 
but in fact one of the most useful ways
is their formally called

644
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,910 
the inspection method informally

645
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,510 
its called if you work that out going
one way

646
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,730 
then you ought to remember the answer so
that you know how to get back

647
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,830 
method so what that says is

648
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:58,270 
remember dead we worked an example and
in fact I showed you the example

649
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,440 
earlier in the lecture that

650
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,750 
the Fourier transform a view to the
minus eighty times a step

651
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,820 
is one over J Omega plus a

652
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,250 
so what is the inverse Fourier transform
a 1-over J Omega plus a

653
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,090 
well ants need to the minus eighty

654
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,190 
times unit step

655
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:26,530 
and that's just simply remembering in
essence this particular transformed pier

656
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,900 
well I've drawn graphically

657
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,190 
the magnitude of the Fourier transform
here

658
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,400 
and below it we have the impulse
response

659
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,720 
the apostle spines is as I just
indicated either -80

660
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,430 
times you see now let's go back up and
look at

661
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,560 
the magnitude over the frequency
response

662
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,330 
and given just a little bit of
discussion that we had

663
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,970 
previously about filtering you should be
able to

664
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,350 
in for something about the filtering
characteristics

665
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,000 
love this simple first-order
differential equation

666
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,950 
in particular if you look at that
frequency response

667
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,840 
the frequency response falls off with
frequency and so it tends to do

668
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,310 
is attenuate high frequencies and

669
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,580 
retain low frequencies so in fact

670
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,110 
you could think of the defocus saying
that we did on

671
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,720 
the imager for EA you could think if
that approximately as

672
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,930 
similar to the kind of filtering action
that you would get

673
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,900 
by passing a signal through a
first-order differential equation

674
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,140 
okay now just illustrate in one

675
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,810 
additional step in both evaluating
inverse transforms and using Fourier

676
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,690 
transform properties

677
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,680 
to solve a near constant coefficient
differential equations

678
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,280 
let's take this same example and rather

679
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,020 
then finding the impulse response let's
find the response

680
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,030 
to another exponential input

681
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,900 
now we could of course do that using the
convolution integral we just got the

682
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,099 
impulse response so we can put that

683
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:22,240 
through the convolution integral to get
the response to this input

684
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,200 
but let's do it instead by going back to
the differential equation

685
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,079 
and so here i'm taking a differential
equation

686
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,589 
all choose just to have some numbers to
work with

687
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:39,980 
a equal to 2 and now

688
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,250 
I'll choose an exponential on the right
hand side either minus tee times you

689
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,329 
have t

690
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:52,010 
and again we for EA transform the
equation

691
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,020 
and we can remember

692
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,440 
this particular Fourier transform pair
it's just the one who worked out

693
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,740 
previously now with a equal to 1 clearly
we're getting a lot of mileage out of

694
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,740 
that example

695
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:11,559 
and now if we wanted determine what the
output why if he is

696
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,069 
we can't do that by solving for Y Omega

697
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:18,420 
and then generating the inverse Fourier
transform

698
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,800 
well what's all this algebraically for y
Omega

699
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,770 
and and that gets us to this expression

700
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,130 
and this is not a Fourier transform that
we've worked out before

701
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,130 
and this is have the second part to the

702
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:39,720 
inspection procedure what we have is a
forty a transform which is a product

703
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,240 
of two turns each of which we can
recognize

704
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,410 
and what we can consider doing is
expanding that out

705
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,390 
in a partial fraction expansion namely
as a summer turns

706
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:56,510 
because the lady arity property
associated with the 48 transform

707
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,950 
the inverse transform is then the song
the inverse transform movie to those

708
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,650 
terms

709
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:08,329 
okay so if we expand this out in a
partial fraction expansion

710
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:11,730 
and you can just verify that

711
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,750 
if you add these two together you get
back to where we started

712
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,000 
we now have the sum of two terms

713
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,190 
and if we now recognized by inspection

714
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:30,079 
the inverse Fourier transform love this
we see that it simply

715
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,020 
minus either -2 TV times the unit step

716
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,609 
this one is plus either the minus the
times a unit step

717
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,900 
and so in fact it's the summer these two
terms

718
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,410 
which are the inverse transforms up the

719
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,309 
individual turns in a partial fraction
expansion

720
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:56,369 
that then give us the for EA transform

721
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:59,760 
all y ft

722
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,089 
her I'm sorry for her rather the output

723
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:07,309 
so this is a gypsy that this is why if
the

724
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:10,520 
which is the summer these two
exponentials and this

725
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,990 
is the inverse Fourier transform

726
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:20,319 
love y Omega as we calculated it
previously

727
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,470 
okay well hopefully you're beginning to
get some sense now

728
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:27,520 
love how powerful and also beautiful

729
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,290 
the 48 transform is we've seen already
that

730
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,369 
a glimpse or how it plays a role in

731
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,760 
filtering modulation how its properties
helpless with linear constant

732
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,200 
coefficient differential equations et
cetera

733
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,230 
what we will do

734
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,500 
beginning with the next lecture is
develop

735
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,940 
a similar set of tools for the
discrete-time case and there are

736
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,530 
some very strong similarities to what
we've done a continuous-time also some

737
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,500 
very important differences

738
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,030 
and then after we have the
continuous-time and discrete-time

739
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,599 
Fourier transforms

740
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,579 
will then see how the concepts

741
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,760 
involved in the properties involved
leads to

742
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,440 
very important powerful notions love
filtering

743
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,819 
modulation sampling and other

744
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,800 
signal processing ideas thank you
