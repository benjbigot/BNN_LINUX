1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,790 
ha the the

2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:34,410 
the more

3
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,719 
the last time

4
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,620 
we talked about the you the
representation

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,909 
%uh linear time-invariant systems
through the convolution song

6
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,670 
in the discrete-time case and the
convolution integral in the

7
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,579 
continuous-time

8
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,559 
case now although the derivation was
relatively straightforward

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,149 
in fact the result is really kind of
amazing because

10
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,979 
what it tells us is that for linear
time-invariant systems

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,039 
if we know the response to the system to
a single in polls

12
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,360 
at equal 0 or in fact that any other
time

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,590 
then we can determine from that its
response

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,770 
to an arbitrary input through the use of
convolution furthermore

15
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,350 
what we'll see as the course develops is
that in fact

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,940 
the class a linear time-invariant
systems is a very rich class

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,539 
there are lots of systems that have that
property

18
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,849 
and in addition there are lots a very
interesting things that you can do with

19
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,619 
linear time-invariant systems

20
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,310 
in today's lecture

21
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,550 
what I'd like to begin with is focusing

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,280 
on convolution as an algebraic operation

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,429 
and will see that it has a number of
algebraic properties then in turn

24
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:01,849 
have important implications for

25
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:05,009 
linear time-invariant systems then we'll
turn

26
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,030 
to a discussion or what the

27
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,300 
characterization %uh linear
time-invariant systems

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,430 
through convolution implies

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,950 
in terms of the relationship various
other system properties

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,620 
to the impulse response let me begin by

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,250 
reminding you love the basic result that
we

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,209 
develop last time which is the
convolution some

33
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,230 
in discrete-time as

34
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,670 
I indicate here and

35
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,790 
the convolution integral in
continuous-time

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,700 
in and what the convolution some more
the convolution integral tells us

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,850 
is how to relate the output

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,500 
to the input and to the system impulse
response

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,010 
and the expression looks

40
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,660 
basically the same in continuous-time
and discrete-time

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,800 
and I remind you also that we talked
about a graphical interpretation

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,950 
where essentially to graphically

43
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,360 
interpret convolution required for

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,390 
was developed in terms

45
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,840 
or taking the system impulse response

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,020 
flipping it sliding it past the input

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,640 
and with positioned appropriately
depending on the

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,470 
value of the independent variable for
which were computing

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,760 
the convolution and then multiplying and

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,030 
summing in the discrete-time case or
integrating

51
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,840 
in the continuous-time case now

52
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,900 
convolution as an algebraic operation

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,340 
has a number or important properties

54
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,349 
one of the properties of convolution

55
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:57,200 
is that it is what is referred to as
commuted

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120 
community here means that

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,310 
we can think either a convo loving

58
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,209 
X with age or H with axe

59
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,500 
and the order in which that's done

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,049 
doesn't affect the output result so
summarized here

61
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,519 
is what the community operation is

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,330 
in discrete-time or in continuous-time

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,729 
and it says as I just indicated that

64
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,949 
x7 convolved with a chip and

65
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,300 
is equal to a chip and convolved

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,520 
with exit or the same course

67
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,180 
in continuous-time and in fact

68
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,669 
in the lecture last time

69
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:48,730 
we worked an example where we had
indiscreet I'm an impulse response which

70
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,560 
was an exponential

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,790 
and an input which is a unit step

72
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,470 
and in the text what you'll find is

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,710 
the same example work except in that
case

74
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,410 
the input is the exponential and the
system impulse response is the step

75
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,660 
and that corresponds to the example in
the text

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,750 
which is example 3.1

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,800 
and what happens in an example is that
in fact

78
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,880 
what you'll see is that the same result

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,310 
occurs an example 3.1 as we generated

80
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,560 
in the lecture and there's a similar
comparison

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,680 
in continuous-time this example was
worked in

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,830 
lecture and this example

83
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,270 
is work in the text in other words

84
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,380 
the text works the example where the
system

85
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,729 
impulse response is

86
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,130 
unit step and the input is an
exponential

87
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,260 
right now the community property as I
said tells us

88
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,590 
that the order in which we do
convolution

89
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,740 
doesn't affect the result to the
convolution

90
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,970 
the same is true for continuous-time and
discrete-time

91
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,479 
and in fact for the other algebraic
properties that I'll talk about

92
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,080 
the results are exactly the same for
continuous-time and discrete-time

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,260 
so in fact what we can do is

94
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,750 
drop the independent variable as an
argument

95
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,850 
so that we suppress any kinda difference
between continuous and discrete-time

96
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,919 
and suppressing be independent variable

97
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,970 
within state the community property as
I've

98
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,120 
rewritten it here just X convulsed with
age because

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,540 
H involved with the ex the same in
continuous-time

100
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,139 
and discrete-time now

101
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,759 
the derivation to the community property
is

102
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,160 
more less amount you bro which you can
follow through in the book it involves

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,020 
soem changes variables and

104
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,340 
in some things that sort

105
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,650 
what I'd like to focus on with that and
other properties

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,740 
is not the derivation which you can see
in the tax

107
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,790 
by rather the interpretation

108
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,850 
so we have the community property and
now there are two other

109
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,430 
important algebraic properties one being

110
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,120 
what is referred to as the associative
property

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,500 
which tells us that if we have X
convulsed with

112
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,020 
the result ok involving h1 with h2

113
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,289 
that's exactly the same as X convolved
with h1

114
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,919 
and that result involved with h2

115
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,520 
and what this permits is

116
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,539 
for us to write for example ex-convict
alt with h1

117
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,500 
involved with h2 without any ambiguity

118
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,210 
because it doesn't matter from the
associative property

119
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,500 
how we grew the terms together

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,289 
the third important property is what is
referred to as the distributive property

121
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,550 
namely the fact the convolution
distributes over addition

122
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,940 
and what I mean by that is what i've
indicated

123
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,009 
here on the slide dead if

124
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,990 
I think or X convo with the psalm

125
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,729 
of h1n h2 that's identical

126
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,389 
to first involving X with h1

127
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,589 
also can bombing X with h2 and then

128
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,199 
adding the two together and that result

129
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:42,800 
will be the same as this result

130
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,069 
so convolution is community

131
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,120 
associative and it distributes over
addition

132
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,529 
three very important algebraic
properties and

133
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,420 
by the way there are other algebraic
operations that have

134
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,100 
that same property for example
multiplication

135
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,480 
numbers is likewise commuted to
associative

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680 
and distributed now

137
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,240 
let's look at what these three
properties

138
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,200 
imply a specifically for linear
time-invariant systems

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640 
and as we'll see the the implications

140
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,290 
are both very interesting and very
important

141
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,940 
let's begin with the community property

142
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,470 
and consider in particular

143
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,649 
a system with an impulse response age

144
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,470 
and I represent that by simply writing
the H inside the box

145
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,620 
an input tax and an output then

146
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,130 
which is X convulsed with age

147
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,200 
now since this operation is commuted to

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,060 
I can right is that affects convolved
with a I can write

149
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,950 
H convolved with ex and that would
correspond

150
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,250 
to a system with impulse response

151
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,149 
X and input H and output then

152
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,910 
age involved with ex

153
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,459 
so the community property

154
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,620 
tells us therefore a linear
time-invariant system

155
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,180 
the system output is independent

156
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,370 
all which function we call the input

157
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,480 
and which function we call the impulse
response kind amazing actually

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,120 
we can interchange the role input and
impulse response

159
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,160 
and from input or permit output point of
view

160
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,670 
the output for the system doesn't care

161
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,610 
now furthermore if we combine the
community property

162
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,140 
with the associative property we get
another very interesting result

163
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,870 
namely that if we have two linear
time-invariant systems in cascade

164
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,930 
the overall system is independent of the
order in which they are cascaded

165
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,240 
and in fact in either case the Cascade
can be

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,690 
collapsed into a single system

167
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,089 
to see this let's first consider

168
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,750 
the Cascade or two systems one with
impulse response h1

169
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,519 
the other with impulse response h2 and

170
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640 
the outputted the first system is then

171
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,810 
X convulsed with h1

172
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,500 
and then that is the input to the second
system

173
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,260 
and so the output a bad is that result

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,950 
convolved with h2

175
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,529 
so this is the result of cascading the
two

176
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,050 
and now we can use the associative
property

177
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,300 
to rewrite this and as

178
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,860 
X involved with h1

179
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,190 
involved with h2 where we grew these two
terms together

180
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,640 
and so using the associative property

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,540 
we now can collapse that into a single
system

182
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,390 
with an input which is ax an impulse
response which is h1 convolved with h2

183
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,470 
and the output is then ex-convict all
with

184
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,880 
the result that those two can borrow

185
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,930 
next we can apply the community property

186
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,430 
and the commuter property says we could
write

187
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,970 
this impulse response that way or we can
write it this way

188
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,510 
and since convolutions community the
resulting output will be exactly the

189
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,130 
same

190
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,230 
and so these resulting output will be
exactly the same

191
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,420 
and now once again we can use the
associative property

192
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,700 
to group these two terms together

193
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,570 
and X convulsed with h2

194
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,399 
corresponds to putting X first through
the system h2

195
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000 
and then an output through the system h1
and so

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,730 
finally applying the associative
property again as I just outlined

197
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,160 
we can expand that system back into

198
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,360 
two systems in cascade with h2 first

199
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,620 
NH one second

200
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,519 
okay well that involves a certain amount
love algebraic manipulation

201
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,410 
and that it's not the algebraic
manipulation that's important is the

202
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,279 
result that it's important

203
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,360 
and what the result says to reiterate
this if I have to

204
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,740 
linear time-invariant systems in cascade

205
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,760 
I can cascade them in any order and the
result is the same

206
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,110 
now you might think well G maybe that
actually applies the systems in general

207
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,120 
whether you put them this way or that
way but in fact as we talked about last

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,209 
time

209
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,550 
and I illustrated with an example

210
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,089 
in general if the system is not linear

211
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,320 
the systems are not linear and
time-invariant then

212
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,459 
the order in which they are cascaded is
important to the interpretation of the

213
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,720 
overall system

214
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,850 
for example one system took the square
root

215
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,990 
any other system double the input

216
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,029 
taking the square root and then doubling

217
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,160 
gives us a different answer doubling
first and then taking the square root

218
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,209 
and of course one can construct much
more elaborate example

219
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:31,730 
net so it's a property very particular
to linear time-invariant systems and

220
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,670 
also

221
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:39,670 
one that we will exploit many many times
as we go through this material

222
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,019 
the final property related to

223
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,889 
interconnection systems that I want to
just indicate

224
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:51,300 
develops ida the distributive property

225
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,880 
and what it applies to is an
interpretation

226
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,040 
%uh the interconnection of systems in
parallel

227
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,240 
recall there the parallel combination

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,200 
systems corresponds is a indicate here

229
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,180 
to a system in which we simultaneously
feed the input into

230
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,700 
h1 nh2 these representing the impulse
responses

231
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,200 
and then the outputs our song and to
form

232
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,920 
the overall output and

233
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,720 
using the fact their convolution
distributes

234
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,769 
over addition we can rewrite yes

235
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,380 
as X involved with h1

236
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,779 
plus h2

237
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,639 
and when we do that then we can
recognize this

238
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,450 
as the output the system with input acts

239
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,329 
and impulse response which is the sum of
these two impulse responses

240
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:54,649 
so for linear time-invariant systems in
parallel

241
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,930 
we can if we choose

242
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,630 
replace that interconnection by a single
system

243
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,639 
whose impulse response is simply some

244
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,050 
those impulse response

245
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,649 
okay now we have this very

246
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,110 
powerful representation for linear
time-invariant systems

247
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,070 
terms 0 convolution and we've seen so
far in this lecture

248
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,990 
how convolution and the representation
through the impulse response

249
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,110 
leads to some but important implications
for system interconnections

250
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,110 
what I like to turn to now are other
system properties

251
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,670 
and see how for linear time-invariant
systems in particular

252
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,510 
other system properties can be
Associated

253
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,610 
with particular properties or
characteristics

254
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,660 
love the system impulse response and
what will talk about

255
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,920 
are a variety of properties will talk
about the issue memory will talk about

256
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,589 
the issue

257
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,809 
portability and will talk about the
issue

258
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:10,240 
causality and also stability

259
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,169 
well let's begin with the issue of
memory and the question

260
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:18,299 
now is what are the implications

261
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,870 
for the system impulse response for a
linear time-invariant system remember

262
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,459 
that we're always imposing that on the
system

263
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,330 
what are the implications on the impulse
response if the system

264
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,380 
does or does not have memory

265
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,470 
well we can answer that by looking at

266
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,889 
the convolution property

267
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:46,710 
and we have here as a reminder the
convolution integral

268
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,320 
which tells us how accept an hour in a
chip T-minus

269
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,049 
now are combined to give us y'at

270
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,369 
and what I've illustrated above is

271
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,749 
only general kind of example

272
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,859 
here is except al here is

273
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:09,489 
a chip T-minus now an

274
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,850 
to compute the output at any time T

275
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,440 
we would take these two multiply them
together

276
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,779 
and integrate from minus infinity the
plus infinity

277
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,879 
so the question then is what can we say
about

278
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,009 
H T the impulse response

279
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,340 
in order to guarantee let's say

280
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,109 
that the output depends only on the
input at time t

281
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,269 
well its pretty much obvious from
looking

282
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,929 
at the grabs

283
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,309 
if we only want the output to depend

284
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,769 
on XO how at Tower equals T

285
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,820 
then a chip T-minus have 0 better

286
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,389 
be non-zero only at Tower equals T

287
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,059 
and so the implication is that

288
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,749 
for the system to be memory less

289
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,619 
what we require is that HFT -10 now

290
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,019 
be 90 only at outcalls

291
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,309 
T so

292
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:22,259 
we want the impulse response to be 90
and only one point

293
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,519 
we wanted to contribute something after
we multiply and go through an integral

294
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,960 
an effect with that says is the only
thing they can be

295
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,440 
and meet all those conditions is a scale
dimples

296
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,229 
so if the system is to be memoryless

297
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:43,039 
then that requires that the impulse
response you scale them poles

298
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,049 
any other impulse response

299
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,249 
then in essence requires

300
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:54,239 
that the system has memory or implies
that the system member

301
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,590 
so for the continuous-time case then

302
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,779 
memoryless would correspond only to the
impulse response being proportional to

303
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,389 
an impulse and in the discrete-time case

304
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,460 
a similar statement in which case

305
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,809 
the output is just proportional

306
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,119 
to the input again either in the
continuous-time

307
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,440 
war in the discrete-time case

308
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,679 
right now we can turn our attention to
the issue

309
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,629 
love system inverter ability and

310
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,099 
room recall that what is meant by

311
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,729 
inverted bility of a system or the
inverse of a system

312
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:41,799 
the inverse nervous system is a system
which one week cascaded

313
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,289 
with the one that were requiring about
the overall cascade

314
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,359 
is the identity system in other words

315
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,419 
the output is equal to the in

316
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,529 
so let's consider a system with

317
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,470 
impulse response age input is ax

318
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,929 
and let's say that the impulse response
that the inverse system is a

319
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,970 
by and the output is why

320
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,320 
then the output of this system is

321
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,879 
X convolved with age convolved with a
stir by

322
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,059 
and we want this to

323
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,419 
come out equal X and what that requires
then

324
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,539 
is that this convolution

325
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,979 
just simply be equal to an impulse

326
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:35,129 
either in the discrete-time case

327
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:38,299 
or in the continuous-time

328
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,619 
and under those conditions then HD by

329
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:44,649 
is equal to the University

330
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:48,749 
rotationally by the way its of
inconvenient

331
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:52,409 
to right instead of eight supply as the
impulse response

332
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:57,220 
the embers will find it convenient of
any more typical

333
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,519 
to write as the in burners instead of
age to buy

334
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,529 
age to the -1

335
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,669 
and we mean by that the inverse

336
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,669 
impulse response and one has to be
careful not to misinterpret this

337
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,720 
as the reciprocal have a chip to your
YouTube and

338
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,720 
which meant in this notation is the
inverse system

339
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:28,109 
now if age to buy

340
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:33,950 
is the inverse of age is H the inverse
have a supply

341
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,359 
well it seems like that or be plausible
or

342
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,419 
perhaps make sense the question if

343
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,909 
you believe that the answer is yes is
howdy how in fact

344
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,229 
you verified that and

345
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:52,070 
I'll leave that to you think about it
the answer is yes that

346
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,159 
if a surprise the inverse of age than H
is the inverse a pizza by

347
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,210 
and the key to showing that is to
exploit the fact

348
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,849 
that when we take the systems and
Cascade them we can cascade

349
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,909 
them in your order

350
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:11,940 
all right now let's turn to another
system property

351
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,590 
the property love stability and again

352
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,229 
we can't I that property directly

353
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,359 
to issues related

354
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,019 
in particular to the system impulse
response

355
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,379 
now stability is defined as we've chosen
to define it as I

356
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:36,629 
I by the previously as bounded input
bounded out but stability in other words

357
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:38,179 
for every bounded input

358
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,919 
is a bounded out what you can show

359
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,509 
and I won't go through the algebra here
it's

360
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,590 
going through in the book is the

361
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,070 
a necessary and sufficient condition for

362
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,950 
a linear time-invariant system to be
stable

363
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,149 
it in the bounded input bounded output
sense

364
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,289 
is that the

365
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:06,879 
impulse response be what is referred to
as

366
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,929 
absolutely so mobile in other words if
you take the absolute values

367
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,330 
and some over infinite limits that's
fine I

368
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,469 
or in the continuous-time

369
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:23,559 
case that the impulse response is
absolutely integral

370
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,479 
in other words if you take the absolute
bad news have a chip T

371
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,429 
integrate that's fine I'd and under
those conditions

372
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,879 
the system is stable if

373
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:38,080 
those conditions are violated then

374
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,519 
for sure as you'll see in the text the
system

375
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,619 
is on stable so stability can also

376
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:50,489 
be tied to the system impulse response

377
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,629 
now the next property that I wanna talk
about

378
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:56,690 
is the property of causality

379
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,729 
and before I do what I'd like to do

380
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:03,869 
is introduce peripheral result that will
then

381
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,889 
use when we talk about causality

382
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:10,599 
namely what's referred to as the zero
input response

383
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,840 
when your system

384
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,070 
the basic result which is a very
interesting and useful one

385
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,309 
is that for a linear system and in fact

386
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,629 
it's whether it's time invariant or not
this applies

387
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:31,669 
if you put nothing into it you get
nothing out

388
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:34,690 
so if we have an input

389
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,769 
accept T which is zero for all T

390
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:43,330 
and if the output that system

391
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,009 
is y'at

392
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,190 
if the input is zero for all time

393
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,479 
then the output likewise is 0 for all
time

394
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:57,539 
that's true for continuous-time and

395
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:04,539 
it's also true for discrete-time

396
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,809 
and in fact to show that result

397
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:14,749 
is pretty much straightforward we could
do it either by using convolution which

398
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:18,820 
would of course be associated with many
a ready in time invariance

399
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,840 
but in fact we can show their property
relatively easily

400
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,039 
by simply using the fact that for a
linear system

401
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,269 
what we know is that if

402
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,330 
we have an input exit T

403
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,409 
with an output y'at

404
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:40,619 
then if we scale the input

405
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,979 
then the output scales accordingly

406
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,019 
well we can simply shoes

407
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:51,320 
as the scale factor eight equal 0

408
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,969 
and if we do that it says put nothing in

409
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:58,320 
you get nothing out and

410
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,299 
what will see is that that has some
important implications

411
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,450 
interns love causality

412
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,409 
it's important though wall or on it to
stress that

413
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:12,729 
not every system obviously has that
property did nothing

414
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:16,099 
you get nothing out a simple example

415
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,409 
is let's say a battery

416
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:24,049 
let's say not connected to anything the
output is six bolts no matter what the

417
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,279 
input is

418
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,919 
and it of course then doesn't have this

419
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,570 
0 response to zero input very particular

420
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,070 
the linear systems or I will now

421
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:41,070 
let's see what this means for causality

422
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,269 
to remind you causality says in effect

423
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:47,909 
that the system can't anticipate the
input that's what

424
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:51,639 
basically causality means when we

425
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:55,690 
talked about it previously we defined it
in a variety of ways

426
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,690 
one of which was the statement that

427
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,499 
if two inputs are identical up until
sometime

428
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:08,159 
than the outputs must be identical up
until the same time

429
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,679 
the reason kinda to Italy is that

430
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,359 
if the system is causal so it can
anticipate the future

431
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,019 
can anticipate whether these two
identical imports are

432
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,149 
sometime later going to change from each
other

433
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,710 
or not

434
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,029 
so causality in general is simply this
statement

435
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:34,059 
either continuous-time and discrete-time

436
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,239 
and now let's look at what that means

437
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:41,149 
for a linear system for a linear system

438
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:45,749 
what that corresponds to or can be
translated to

439
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:49,129 
is a statement it says that

440
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:53,909 
if x50 is 0 party less than $30,000

441
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:57,450 
then y'at is the must be zero

442
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,619 
party less than $30,000 also

443
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:04,669 
and so what that in effect

444
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:07,809 
says is that the system

445
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,320 
for a linear system to be causal

446
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,909 
in mice have the property sometimes
referred to

447
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,080 
as initial rest meaning

448
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,879 
it doesn't respond until there's some
input that happen

449
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:27,489 
that it initially at rest until the
input becomes

450
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,609 
90 now why is this true why

451
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,599 
is this a consequence of causality for

452
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,469 
Lee year systems well the reason is

453
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:43,659 
we know that if we put nothing in we get
nothing out

454
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:47,830 
if we have an input that 0 perty less
than t0

455
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,200 
and the system can't anticipate whether
that input is going to change from zero

456
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,739 
or not then yes it must also the system
must generate

457
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:02,690 
and output that 0 up until that time

458
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,809 
following the principle that if two
inputs are identical up until sometime

459
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,700 
the outputs must be identical up same
time

460
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,679 
so this basic result

461
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,759 
for when here systems is essentially

462
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,019 
a consequence all the statement there

463
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,879 
for a linear system 0n

464
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:32,879 
gives us 0 out

465
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:37,259 
now bad tells us

466
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,669 
how to interpret or hi I don't tupac was
ality

467
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:46,389 
for linear systems now let's proceed to
linear time-invariant systems

468
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:50,919 
and in fact we can carry the point one
step further

469
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,259 
in particular necessary and sufficient
condition

470
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:59,869 
for causality in the case linear
time-invariant systems

471
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:03,499 
is there the impulse response

472
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:07,950 
be 0 party less than zero

473
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,450 
in the continuous-time case or

474
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,669 
for and less than zero in the
discrete-time case

475
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:18,519 
so for linear time-invariant systems
causality

476
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,129 
is equivalent to the impulse response

477
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:27,109 
being 0 up until to your and equal to 0

478
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:31,690 
now to show this it essentially follows

479
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,369 
by first considering

480
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,399 
why causality

481
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,739 
would imply that this is true

482
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:46,679 
and that follows because if the
straightforward fact

483
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,639 
that the impulse itself is 0 perty less
than zero

484
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:57,320 
and what we saw is there before is that

485
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,399 
for any linear system causality requires
that if the input is your office or

486
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,299 
sometime

487
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,209 
the output must be zero up until the
same time

488
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:09,279 
and so thats showing

489
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,099 
the result in one direction to show the
result

490
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,119 
in the other direction namely to show
you that

491
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,179 
yeah in fact the impulse response

492
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,889 
satisfied that condition then the system
is causal

493
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,940 
while I won't work through it in detail

494
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,849 
it essentially boils down to recognizing

495
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:35,729 
that in the convolutions some

496
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:39,999 
or in the convolution integral

497
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:45,119 
if in fact that condition is satisfied
on the impulse response

498
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,919 
then the upper limit on the song the
discrete-time

499
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,209 
case changes an and in the
continuous-time

500
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:55,969 
case changes to see and that in effect

501
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:59,159 
says that bad news or

502
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,029 
the input only from minus unity up the
time n

503
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:07,839 
are used in computing y van and a
similar kind of result

504
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,309 
for the continuous-time case why

505
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,029 
T

506
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:19,589 
okay so we've seen how the impulse
response

507
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:23,200 
or rather how certain system properties
in the linear time-invariant

508
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,509 
case can be converted into

509
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:30,830 
various requirements on the imports
responsible when your time

510
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,479 
very insist on the impulse response
being complete characterization

511
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,679 
let's looked at some particular examples
just

512
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,169 
to and a cement the ideas further

513
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,929 
and let's begin with a system that
you've seen previously which is

514
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,749 
accumulator accumulator as you recall

515
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,969 
has an output why I have an

516
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:57,989 
which is the accumulated value

517
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:03,089 
up the input from minus infinity up to n

518
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:06,580 
now you've seen in the impose in in

519
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,240 
a previous lecture or rather in the
video course manual for previous

520
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,460 
lecture that an accumulator is a linear
time-invariant system

521
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,750 
and in fact it's impossible sponsor is
the accumulated

522
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,629 
bad news opinion polls namely the
impulse response

523
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:27,690 
is equal to a step

524
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,700 
so what we want to answer is

525
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,060 
what knowing what that impulse responses
what

526
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,310 
some properties are the accumulator

527
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,429 
and let's first ask about memory

528
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,599 
well we recognize that the impulse
response

529
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,869 
is not simply an impulse in fact it's a
step

530
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:52,039 
and so this implies what well

531
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,159 
it implies that the system has

532
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,089 
memory

533
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:03,250 
second the impulse response

534
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,809 
is zero more and less than zero

535
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:10,750 
that implies that the system is

536
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,220 
causal

537
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,599 
and finally if we look at

538
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,299 
the some the absolute values at the
impulse response from minus infinity

539
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:25,990 
plus infinity

540
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,490 
this is a step we accumulate those
values over infinite limits

541
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,240 
then at in fact comes out to be infinite

542
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,250 
and so what that implies then is that

543
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,460 
the accumulator is not stable in

544
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,250 
the bounded input found that out what
sets

545
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,180 
now I want to turn to some other systems
but while we're on the accumulator I

546
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,299 
just want to draw your attention to the
fact

547
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:58,619 
which will kinda come up in a variety of
ways again later

548
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:04,710 
that we can rewrite the equation for an
accumulator the difference equation

549
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,890 
by recognizing that we could in fact

550
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,930 
write the output as the accumulated
values

551
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,160 
up the time n -1 and then and on the
last value

552
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,539 
and in fact if we do that this
corresponds to why

553
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:24,660 
van -1 and so

554
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,359 
we could rewrite this difference
equation as why I have an

555
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,380 
is why event -1 a sexy

556
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,930 
so the output is the previously computed
output

557
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,160 
plus the input expressed that way

558
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,200 
what that corresponds to is what is

559
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,750 
collar workers a difference equation and
difference equations will be a topic

560
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,309 
I'll considerable emphasis in the next
lecture

561
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,390 
now does an accumulator have an inverse
well

562
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:58,339 
the answer is in fact yes and let's look
at what

563
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,220 
the inverse that the accumulator is

564
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,319 
the impulse response the accumulator is
a step

565
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:09,769 
to inquire about its inverse in we
inquire

566
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,339 
about whether there's a system which one
we cascade

567
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,269 
the accumulator with that system which
i'm calling its in burrs

568
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:22,400 
we get an impulse out

569
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,980 
well let's see the impulse response

570
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,880 
the accumulators staff we want to put
the step into something

571
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,579 
and get out in polls and in fact

572
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:36,599 
what you recall from the

573
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,950 
lecture in which we introduce steps and
impulses

574
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,670 
the impulse is in fact the first
difference of the units that

575
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,829 
so we have a difference equation

576
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,710 
that describes 4s how the impulse

577
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,490 
is related to the step and so

578
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,440 
if this system does this the output will
be

579
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,000 
that an impulse and so if we think

580
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,829 
or x2 a van

581
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:10,849 
and as the input and y2 event is the
output

582
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,279 
then difference equation for

583
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:18,369 
the inverse system is what i've
indicated here

584
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,480 
and if we want to look at the impulse
response to that

585
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,910 
we can then inquire as to what the
responses with an impulse in

586
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,710 
and white develops in a straightforward
way

587
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,500 
and is Delta van which is are important
point

588
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,609 
minus Delta again -1

589
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,700 
is equal to the impulse response

590
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,910 
in burrs system so alright that

591
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,420 
as age in person

592
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,930 
now we have been that the accumulator

593
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,470 
as it infers and this is the embers

594
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,480 
and you can examine issues a memory
stability causality et cetera

595
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,579 
what you find is that the system has
memory

596
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,619 
the University later it's stable

597
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,250 
and its causal and it's interesting to
note by the way

598
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,849 
that although the accumulator with an
unstable system

599
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:19,960 
the embers are the king later is a
stable system

600
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,769 
in general if a system is stable its
inverse

601
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,970 
does not have to be stable or vice versa

602
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,220 
and the same thing with causality

603
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,420 
okay now there are

604
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,240 
a number of other examples which course
we could discuss

605
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,059 
and let me just quickly point to

606
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,950 
in one example which is a difference
equation as i've indicated

607
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,339 
here and as will talk about it more
detail

608
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:58,059 
in our next lecture will will

609
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,380 
get involved in a fairly detailed
discussion linear cut coefficient

610
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,210 
difference

611
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,319 
and differential equations this falls
into that category

612
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,510 
and under the imposition

613
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,960 
what's referred to as initial rest

614
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,369 
which corresponds to response being 0

615
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,760 
up until the time that the input becomes
non-zero

616
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,779 
the impulse response is a to the N

617
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:27,200 
times you have an and something that

618
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,220 
you'll be asked to think about in the
video course manual

619
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,720 
is whether that system has memory
whether its causal

620
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,250 
and whether it's stable and likewise

621
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,730 
for a linear constant coefficient

622
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,140 
differential equation the specific one

623
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,430 
that I've indicated here under

624
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,619 
the assumption of initial rest the
impulse response

625
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,740 
is into the minus two tee times you the

626
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,440 
and in the video course manual again
you'll be asked

627
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,559 
to examined whether the system has
memory

628
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,410 
whether its causal and whether it's
stable

629
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,059 
okay well as i've indicated in the next
lecture will

630
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:14,509 
return to much more detailed discussion
when your constant coefficient

631
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:15,660 
differential and difference

632
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,059 
equations now what I'd like to finally

633
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:25,599 
doing this lecture is use the notion of
convolution in a much different way

634
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,069 
to help us with a problem that I alluded
to earlier

635
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:34,230 
in particular the issue love how to deal
with some other mathematical

636
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,470 
difficulties associated

637
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,630 
with impulses and steps

638
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,980 
now let me begin by illustrating

639
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,890 
kinda what the problem is and the

640
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,720 
an example of the kinda paradox that
sore right to

641
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,920 
when dealing with impose functions and
step

642
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,019 
options

643
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,420 
let's consider first the ball a system

644
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,750 
which is the identity system and so the
output is

645
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,259 
course equal to the input and

646
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:14,849 
again we can talk about that either in
continuous-time and discrete-time

647
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,210 
well we know that the function that you

648
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,299 
convolved with a signal to retain a
signal

649
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:26,059 
is an impulse and so that means that the
impulse response

650
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:32,269 
love and identity system is an impulse
makes logical sense

651
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:37,450 
furthermore if I take to identity
systems and Cascade them

652
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,470 
I put in an input get the same thing and
the first system that goes into the

653
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,299 
second system get the same thing at the
second

654
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:47,880 
in other words if I have to

655
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,569 
identity systems in cascade

656
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,849 
the cascade likewise is an identity
system

657
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,069 
in other words this overall system is

658
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:03,319 
also and identity system

659
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:07,460 
and the implication there is that the
impulse response

660
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,779 
up this is an impulse the impulse
response if this is an impulse

661
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:16,599 
and the convolution of those two is also
an impulse

662
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:21,339 
so for continuous time we require than
that

663
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:24,579 
interpose convolved with itself was an
impulse

664
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:28,859 
and the same thing for discrete-time

665
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,869 
now in discrete-time

666
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,539 
we don't have any particular problem
with that if you think about convolved

667
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:36,849 
in these together

668
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,279 
it's a straightforward mathematical
operation

669
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,779 
since the impulse in continue in
discrete-time

670
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:47,329 
is very nicely defined

671
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,089 
however in continuous-time we have to be
somewhat careful

672
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:54,309 
about the definition at the impulse
because

673
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,950 
it was the derivative a step-by-step has
a discontinuity

674
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,230 
you can't really differentiate at a
discontinuity

675
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,250 
in the way that we dealt with that was

676
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,930 
to expand out the discontinuity so that

677
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,119 
it had some finite time region in which
it happen

678
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,170 
when we did that we ended up with a
definition for the impulse

679
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,240 
which was the limiting or up this
function

680
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,480 
which is a rectangle with Delta

681
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,130 
and height one over Delta and an area
equal to 1

682
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,279 
now if we think I'll convolved being

683
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:34,880 
this signal with itself the impose being
a limiting

684
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,529 
former this then the convolution

685
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:42,049 
up this with itself is a triangle

686
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:45,390 
with to Delta height1 over Delta

687
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,430 
in area 1 in other words

688
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,579 
this triangular function is this

689
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,930 
approximation delta sig Delta T

690
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,059 
can't fault with dealt this adult T

691
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:02,250 
and since this would then

692
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,509 
the limited this would correspond to the
impulse response

693
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:10,759 
all the identity system

694
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:14,460 
convolved with itself the implication is

695
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,509 
that not only should the top

696
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,349 
function this one

697
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,700 
correspond in its limiting form to an
impulse

698
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,240 
but also this should correspond it is
limiting

699
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,339 
form to an impulse so one could wonder
well what is an impulse is it

700
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:39,589 
this one in the limit or is that this
one in the limit

701
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:42,819 
now beyond that there

702
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:46,019 
so kinda what this suggests is that in
the limiting

703
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,289 
for me kinda run into a contradiction
unless you don't

704
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:53,190 
try to distinguish between this
rectangle in the Triangle

705
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,289 
things get even worse when you think
about

706
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:59,269 
what happens when you put an impulse
into a differentiator in a

707
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:03,670 
differentiator is a very commonly
occurring system

708
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,970 
in particular suppose we had a system
for which

709
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,049 
the output was the derivative of the
input

710
00:46:11,049 --> 00:46:14,619 
so if we put in extra T we got out the
exit

711
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:21,109 
the DT if I put in an impulse or if I
talked about the impulse response what

712
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:23,160 
is that

713
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,500 
and of course the problem is that if

714
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,569 
you think that the impossible self is
very badly behaved

715
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:34,809 
then what about its derivative which is
not only

716
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:38,349 
infinitely big but there's a positive
going on in negative going one in the

717
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:40,529 
difference between a handsome area

718
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:45,970 
and you your end up in a lot of
difficult

719
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,900 
well the way around this formally is
through

720
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,210 
a set of mathematics refer to as
generalized functions

721
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:00,029 
we won't be quite that formal but I'd
like to at least

722
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:03,890 
suggest with the essence that formality
is and it really

723
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:09,650 
helps us in interpreting the impulses
and steps and functions at that time

724
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,170 
and what it is is operational definition

725
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,480 
love steps impulses and their
derivatives

726
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,589 
in the following sense: usually when we
talk about a function

727
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:24,990 
we talk about what the bag with the
function is at any instant of time

728
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,809 
course the trouble with an impulse is
it's infinitely bigan 0 within has some

729
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:31,049 
areas center

730
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,390 
well we can turn to is what is referred
to as

731
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,569 
and operational definition where

732
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:41,390 
the operational definition

733
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,920 
is related not to what the impulses

734
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,950 
but to what the impulse does under

735
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,309 
the operation convolution so

736
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:54,509 
what is an impulse and impose is

737
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:59,490 
something which under convolution
retains the function

738
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,230 
and net then conserve as a definition of
the imports

739
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:08,279 
well let's see where that gets us
suppose that we now

740
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:13,390 
want to talk about the derivative up the
in polls

741
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,470 
well what we ask about is

742
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,220 
what it is operationally and so if we
have a system

743
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,539 
which is a differentiator an

744
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,220 
we inquire about it's impossible
response which let's say we define

745
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,900 
rotationally as you serve 180

746
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,720 
what's important about this function you
serve one ft

747
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,130 
is not what it is at each value time

748
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,890 
but what it does under convolution

749
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,269 
what is it doing a convolution well the

750
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:50,539 
output the differentiator is the
convolution

751
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:55,359 
up the input with the impulse response
and so what you serve 180 does on the

752
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,289 
convolution

753
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:59,829 
is to differentiate

754
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,809 
and Nat is the operational definition

755
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:07,450 
and now of course we can think extending
net

756
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,440 
not only would we want to think about
differentiating

757
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,130 
an impulse but we would also what about

758
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,769 
want to think about differentiating the
derivative opinion polls

759
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:23,009 
will define that as a function use up to
eighty

760
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:26,039 
use up to 50 because we have

761
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,220 
this impulse response convolved with
this one is you wanna T convolved you

762
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,730 
wanna T

763
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,880 
and what is you 280

764
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,259 
operationally it is

765
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:41,660 
the operation such that when you can
ball

766
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,819 
that with except he what you get

767
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,559 
is the second derivative

768
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,829 
okay now we can carry this further and
in fact

769
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:55,049 
talk about the result I'll involving

770
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:58,619 
you wanna TE with itself

771
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,890 
more times in fact if we think that the
convolution

772
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:06,099 
or you want it T with it so k times

773
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:11,349 
then logically we define that as use a
Kft

774
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,849 
again we would interpret that
operationally

775
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:17,920 
and the operational definition is
through

776
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,089 
convolution where this corresponds to

777
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:26,180 
use a cave T in the impulse response

778
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,650 
love k differentiators in cascade

779
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,799 
so what is the operational definition
well it simply

780
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,180 
that except the convolved with you sir
kute

781
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,190 
is the K derivative

782
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,670 
accept T and

783
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,289 
this now gives us a set 0 what are
referred to as singularity functions

784
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:51,609 
very well

785
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:55,369 
badly behaved mathematically in a sense
but

786
00:50:55,369 --> 00:51:00,789 
as we've seen reasonably well defined
under an operational definition

787
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:04,220 
the cake was 0 incidently that's the
same as

788
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:09,390 
what we have referred to previously as
the impulse so

789
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:13,269 
cake 0 that's just dealt T

790
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:18,079 
now to be completely can also go the
other way and talk about

791
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,779 
the impulse response a string 'em
integrators instead of a string it

792
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,529 
differentiators

793
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:27,579 
course the impulse response a single
integrator is a unit step

794
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:30,910 
to integrators together is the integral
the units that

795
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,079 
et cetera an that

796
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,180 
likewise corresponds to

797
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,329 
a Sat Nav what are called singularity
functions

798
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:43,819 
in particular if I take string or

799
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:48,140 
am integrators in cascade

800
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,890 
then the impulse response that is

801
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:56,029 
denoted as use up minus MFT

802
00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:00,349 
and for example with a single in a
greater use up minus 150

803
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:04,109 
corresponds to are unit step

804
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:08,970 
as we've talked about previously use a
-2 ft

805
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,869 
our spines to unit ramp

806
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:18,740 
et cetera and there is in fact a reason
for choosing negative values have the

807
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,920 
argument

808
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,839 
when going in one direction here
integration as compared with positive

809
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:26,390 
values the argument we going

810
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,900 
in the other direction namely
differentiation

811
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,019 
in in particular we know bad

812
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:38,009 
with uses my sms to the

813
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:41,569 
the operational definition is the AM

814
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:45,380 
running into kroll and

815
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,420 
like why is use a Kft

816
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,420 
so with a positive subscript has an
operational definition

817
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,759 
which is the derivative so

818
00:52:56,759 --> 00:53:01,329 
if the Cape derivative exit T

819
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:04,599 
and in partly as a consequence if that

820
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,940 
if we take use it Kft

821
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,559 
and convolved it with use ability the
result

822
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,059 
is this the singularity function with
the subscript which is the sum

823
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:19,069 
K&L and that holds whether

824
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:23,279 
this is positive values that the
subscript or negative values at the

825
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:24,749 
subscript

826
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:28,009 
so just to summarize this last
discussion

827
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,039 
we've used an operational definition to

828
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,549 
talk about derivatives love impulses

829
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,789 
and integrals impulses this led

830
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:42,980 
to said a singularity functions work all
singularity functions of which

831
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,130 
the impulse in the stepper two examples
by

832
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,710 
using an operational definition through
convolution

833
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,369 
allows us to to find

834
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:57,640 
at least an operational sense these
functions that otherwise a very badly

835
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,130 
a

836
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:05,069 
okay now in in this lecture in

837
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:09,210 
previous lectures for the most part our
discussion has

838
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,170 
been about linear time-invariant systems

839
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,440 
fairly general terms and we've seen a
variety

840
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,069 
properties representation through
convolution

841
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:25,759 
and properties as they can be associated
with the impulse response

842
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:30,249 
next lecture will turn our attention to
a very important

843
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:35,890 
subclass those systems namely systems
that are described below beilin your

844
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,420 
constant coefficient

845
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,839 
difference equations in the
discrete-time case and when your car is

846
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:42,009 
the coefficient

847
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:45,410 
differential equations in the
continuous-time case

848
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,829 
those classes while not

849
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:52,650 
forming all the classic linear
time-invariant systems

850
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,480 
are very important subclass and will
focus in on those specifically next

851
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,779 
thank you
