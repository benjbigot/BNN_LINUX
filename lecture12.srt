the norm

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:52,130 
are the in discussing the

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:60,330 
continuous-time and discrete-time
Fourier transforms we

14
00:00:60,330 --> 00:01:03,400 
developed a number of important
properties

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,950 
to particularly sitting significant ones
as I mention

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,830 
at the time are the modulation property
and the convolution property

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,280 
starting with the next lecture the one
after this one

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,290 
will be developing and exploiting some
other consequences

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,729 
the modulation property in today's
lecture though I'd like to

20
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,190 
review and expand on the notion of
filtering

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,690 
which as I had mentioned flows more less
directly from

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,810 
the convolution property to begin let me
just quickly review

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,450 
what the convolution property is both
for continuous-time

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,880 
and for discrete-time the convolution
property tells us

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,929 
that the 48 transform

26
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,330 
all the convolution up to time functions

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,990 
is the product up to 48 transforms

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,119 
now what this means

29
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,289 
in terms love linear time-invariant
filters

30
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,130 
since we know that the in the time
domain the output of a linear

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,030 
time-invariant filter is the convolution

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,140 
love the input and the impulse response

33
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,120 
it says essentially then in the
frequency domain

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640 
that the forty a transformer the output
is the product

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,110 
of the 48 transform of the impulse
response

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,940 
namely the frequency response and the
Fourier transform

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,550 
love the input so the output is
described through that product

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,900 
now recall also

39
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,180 
bad in developing the four EA transform
I interpreted

40
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,720 
the Fourier transform as the complex
amplitude

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,780 
over decomposition of the signal interns
have a set of complex exponentials

42
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,120 
and the frequency response for the
convolution property

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,960 
in effect tells us what the amplitudes
how to modify the amplitudes

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,640 
avi to those complex exponentials as
they go through the system

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,820 
now this led to the notion of filtering

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,080 
where the basic concept was that since
we can modify

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,160 
the airport to %uh each of the
exponential

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,610 
complex exponential components
separately weekend for example

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,800 
retain some love them and totally
eliminate others

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,460 
and this is the basic notion of
filtering so

51
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,450 
we have as you recall first evolved the
notion

52
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,570 
in continuous-time all an ideal filter

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,810 
for example I L a straight year an ideal

54
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,680 
low-pass filter where we pass exactly

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,960 
frequency comp phone it's in one band
and reject

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,670 
totally frequency comp ponents in
another band

57
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,570 
the van being passed of course referred
to as the passband

58
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,360 
and the ban rejected as the stopping I

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,470 
illustrated here low pass filter we can
of course

60
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,130 
reject the low frequencies and retain

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,830 
the high frequencies and that then
corresponds to

62
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,570 
ideal high pass filter or we can just
retain frequencies within a band

63
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,360 
and so I show below what is referred to
commonly as

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,789 
a bandpass filter now

65
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,340 
this is what the ideal filters look like

66
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,419 
for continuous-time for discrete-time we
have exactly

67
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,680 
the same situation namely we have

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,500 
an ideal discrete-time low-pass filter
which

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,910 
passes exactly frequencies which are the
low frequencies

70
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,410 
low frequencies of course being around
zero and because the periodicity also

71
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,680 
around 2pi

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,560 
we show also an ideal

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,169 
high pass filter and a high pass filter

74
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,730 
as i indicated last time passes
frequencies around pie

75
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,690 
and finally below that I show an ideal

76
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,860 
bandpass filter a an ideal bandpass
filter passing frequencies

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,220 
someplace in the range between 0 and pie

78
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,350 
and recall also bat the basic difference
between

79
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,010 
continuous-time and discrete-time for
these filters is that

80
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,630 
the discrete-time versions are of course
periodic

81
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,180 
in frequency now let's look at

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,560 
these ideal filters and in particular
the idea low-pass filter

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,330 
in the time domain we have

84
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,290 
the frequency response 0 the idea
low-pass filter

85
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,639 
and shown below it is the impulse
response so here is the frequency

86
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,120 
response

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,660 
and below it the impulse response

88
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,040 
love the ideal low-pass filter

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,290 
and this of course is a sin x over X

90
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,750 
for with impulse response and recognize
also

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,720 
or recall that since this frequency
response

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,980 
is real value

93
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,480 
the impulse response in other words the
inverse transform

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,810 
is an even function of time and

95
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,180 
notice also since I want to refer back
to this

96
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,280 
that the impulse response to an ideal
Lopez filter

97
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,290 
in fact is non causal that follows from
Long other things from the fact that

98
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,020 
it's an even function

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,139 
but keep in mind in fact that sin x over
its function

100
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,480 
goes off to infinity in both directions
so

101
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,580 
the impulse response to the idea
low-pass filter

102
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,580 
is symmetric and continues to have tales
of the plus and minus infinity

103
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,900 
now the situation is basically the same

104
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,650 
in the discrete-time case

105
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,570 
let's look at the frequency response and
associated impulse response

106
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,190 
for an ideal discrete-time low-pass
filter

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,460 
so once again here is the

108
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,199 
frequency response love the idea
low-pass filter

109
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,970 
and below it I show the impulse response

110
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,680 
again its a sin x over x-type impulse
response

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,910 
and again we recognize

112
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,800 
that sits in the frequency domain this
frequency response

113
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,720 
is real bad that means as a consequence

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,340 
of the properties love the forty a
transforming inverse Fourier transform

115
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,949 
that the impulse response is an even
function

116
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,560 
in the time domain and also incidently

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,240 
the sin x over expulsion goes off to
infinity

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,790 
again in both directions

119
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,590 
now we talked about i do. filters

120
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,150 
in this discussion and ideal filters are

121
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,710 
in fact ideal in a certain sense what
they do ideally

122
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,780 
is they pass a certain band of
frequencies exactly

123
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:19,000 
and they reject a band of frequencies
exactly

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,330 
on the other hand there are many
filtering problems in which

125
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,470 
generally we don't have a sharp
distinction between the frequencies we

126
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,080 
want to

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,330 
passed in the frequencies you wanna 12
reject

128
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,979 
one example if this that's elaborated on
in the tax is

129
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,190 
the design of an automotive suspension
system which in fact

130
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,479 
is the design all a low-pass filter

131
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,550 
and basically what you want to do in a
case like that

132
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,899 
is filter out or attenuate

133
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,920 
very rapid Road variations and keep

134
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,620 
the lower variations in of course
elevation of the highway

135
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,259 
or or road and what you can see

136
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,940 
intuitively is dead and there isn't
really a very sharp

137
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,380 
distinction a sharp cutoff between what
you would like to recall

138
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,209 
the low frequencies and what you would
call the high frequencies

139
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,180 
now also somewhat related to this is the
fact dead

140
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,740 
the as we've seen in the time domain is
ideal filters have

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,790 
very particular kind of character for
example let's look back

142
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,950 
at the ideal low-pass filter and

143
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,190 
we saw this the impulse response

144
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,930 
the impulse response is what we've shown
here let's now look

145
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,850 
at the step response love the
discrete-time

146
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,570 
ideal low-pass filter and noticed the
fact that it has a tail that oscillates

147
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,710 
and when this step its in fact it has
oscillatory behavior

148
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,460 
now exactly the same situation occurs

149
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,080 
in continuous-time let's look at the

150
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,890 
step response love the continuous-time

151
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,180 
ideal ok pass filter and

152
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,360 
what we see is that when a step its

153
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,490 
then in fact we get and isolation

154
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,860 
and very often that isolation

155
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,860 
is something this undesirable for
example if you're designing

156
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,339 
an automotive suspension system and you
hit a curve which is

157
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,670 
step input in fact you probably would
not like

158
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,360 
to have the automobile oscillating sort

159
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,260 
sort dying down in in isolation

160
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,790 
now is another very important point
which again

161
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,000 
we can see there in continuous-time and
discrete-time

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,980 
which is that even if we wanted to have

163
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,720 
an ideal filter the ideal filter has
another problem

164
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,970 
if we want to attempt to implemented in
real time

165
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,430 
what's the problem the problem is

166
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,180 
that since the impulse responses even
and in fact

167
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,410 
has details that go of the plus and
minus infinity

168
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,440 
its non causal so if in fact

169
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,029 
we want to build a filter and the filter
is restricted operate in real time

170
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,440 
than in fact we can't build

171
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,470 
an ideal filter so

172
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,880 
what that says is that in practice
although i do. filters

173
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,010 
are nice to think about and perhaps
relate to practical problems

174
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,060 
more typically what we consider

175
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,550 
are non-ideal filters and

176
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,800 
in the discrete-time case non-ideal
filter

177
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,470 
then would have a characteristic
somewhat

178
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,779 
like i've indicated here where instead o

179
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,589 
a very rapid transition from passband to
stop and

180
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,730 
there would be more gradual transition

181
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,760 
with a passband cutoff frequency and

182
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,980 
a stop and cutoff frequency

183
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,390 
and perhaps also instead of having
exactly

184
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,930 
flat characteristic in the stop band and
in the past and

185
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,140 
we would allow a certain amount a ripple

186
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,610 
we also have exactly the same situation

187
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,820 
in continuous-time we're here will just
simply change your frequency axis

188
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,890 
to a continuous frequency axis instead
of the discrete frequency axes

189
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,339 
again we would think in terms of I'm
allowable passband ripple

190
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,980 
a transition from stop and from passband
to stop and

191
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,690 
with a passband cutoff frequency and a
stop and

192
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,709 
cutoff frequency so

193
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,200 
kind of the notion here is dead again i
do. filters are ideal in some respects

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,380 
not ideal in other respects and for many

195
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,050 
practical problems we may not want them
and even if we did want them

196
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,269 
we may not be able to get them perhaps
because at this issue of causality

197
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,029 
even if causality is not an issue what
happens

198
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,700 
in filter design and implementation in
fact

199
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,370 
is dead the sharper you attempt to make
the cut off

200
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,570 
the more expensive in some sense the
filter becomes

201
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,660 
either in terms of comp phone-ins in
continuous-time

202
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,089 
or in terms of computation in
discrete-time

203
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,360 
and so their are these whole variety of
issues

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360 
that really make it important to

205
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,940 
understand the notion love non-ideal

206
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,980 
filters now just two

207
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,750 
illustrate as an example let me remind
you

208
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:52,000 
love one kinda bad example love what in
fact is a non-ideal

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,580 
low-pass filter and we have look
previously

210
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,620 
at The Associated differential equation

211
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,970 
let me now in fact related to a circuit

212
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,040 
and in particular an RC circuit

213
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,950 
where the output could either be across
the capacitor

214
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,610 
or the output can be across the resistor
so

215
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,120 
effect we have two systems here we have
a system

216
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,480 
which is the system function from the
voltage source input to the capacitor

217
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,560 
output

218
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,860 
the system from the both source input

219
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,370 
to the resistor output and in fact

220
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,190 
just up like your cause both its law to
this we can relate those in a very

221
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,829 
straightforward way

222
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,459 
it's very straight forward to verify
that

223
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,750 
the system from input to resist their
output

224
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,019 
is simply the identity system with

225
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,480 
the capacitor output subtracted from

226
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,490 
now we can write the differential
equation

227
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,370 
for either the system's and as we talked
about last time

228
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,410 
in the last several lectures solve that
equation using

229
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,709 
the exploiting the properties at a4e a
transform

230
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:10,980 
and in fact we if we look at the
differential equation

231
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,290 
relating the capacitor output to

232
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,970 
the voltage source input we recognize
that this is an example

233
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,920 
that in effect we saw previously and so

234
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,790 
just working our way down applying the
48 transport to the differential

235
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,990 
equation

236
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,950 
and generating the system function by
taking the ratio of the capacitor

237
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,490 
voltage

238
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,390 
or its Fourier transform to the Fourier
transform the source

239
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,040 
we then have the system function
Associated

240
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,560 
with the system for which the output is
the capacitor voltage

241
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,779 
or if we solve instead for the system
function

242
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,649 
associated with the resistor output

243
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,370 
we can simply subtract h1 from unity

244
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,649 
and the system function that we get in
that case is the system function

245
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:04,750 
that I show here so we have

246
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,990 
now to system functions one for the
capacitor output

247
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,600 
the other for the resistor output and

248
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,440 
one the first corresponding to the
capacitor output

249
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,529 
in fact if we plotted on a linear ramp
up to scale

250
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,860 
looks like this and as you can see and
as we saw last time

251
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,639 
is an approximation to a low pass filter

252
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,889 
it is in fact and non-ideal ok pass
filter

253
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,399 
whereas the resistor output is

254
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,490 
an approximation to a high pass filter

255
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,190 
or in effect and non-ideal high pass
filter

256
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,529 
so in one case just comparing the two we
have

257
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,160 
a low-pass filter as the capacitor
output associate with the capacitor

258
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,110 
output

259
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,120 
and a high pass filter Associated with
the

260
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,550 
resistor out let's just quickly

261
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,410 
look at that example now looking on a
boat reply

262
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,659 
instead o on the linear scale that we
showed before

263
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,829 
and recall incidently a and

264
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,329 
be aware incident leave the fact that
week and of course cascade

265
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,909 
several filters if this type and approve
the characteristics

266
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:22,649 
so I have shown at the top

267
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:26,870 
a bodie plot or the

268
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:32,320 
capacitors system functions associated
with the capacitor output it's flat out

269
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,750 
to a frequency corresponding 21

270
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,559 
over the time constant RC

271
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,799 
and then it falls off at 10 DB

272
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,010 
per decade a decade being a factor 10

273
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,429 
or if instead we looked at the system
function associated with the resistor

274
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,520 
output that corresponds to a

275
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,309 
10 dB per decade increase in frequency

276
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,720 
up to approximately the reciprocal at
the time constant and

277
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,549 
then approaching a flat characteristic
after that

278
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:09,809 
and if we consider either one of these

279
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,820 
looking back again at the low-pass

280
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,020 
filter if we were to cascade several
filters

281
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,700 
with this frequency response then
because we have things plotted on a boat

282
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,559 
reply

283
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,760 
the body plot for the Cascade would
simply be summing these and so

284
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,890 
if we castigated for example two stages

285
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,070 
is that a role of at 10 dB per decade it
would

286
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,770 
role of at 20 DB for decades

287
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,970 
now filters that this type RC filters

288
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,120 
perhaps several of them in cascade are

289
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,150 
in fact very prevalent

290
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,559 
and in fact in a in a an environment

291
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,299 
like this where where in fact doing
recording

292
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,650 
we see there there are

293
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,179 
filters a fact I there show up very
commonly both in the audio

294
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,799 
and the video poker portion or the
signal processing this Associated

295
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,360 
with making this set of tapes in fact

296
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,370 
are let's take a look in the control
room

297
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,630 
and what I'll be able to show you in the
control room

298
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,750 
is the audio portion love

299
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,809 
the processing that's done and the kinds
of filters very much of the type we just

300
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:26,640 
talked about

301
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,470 
their associated with signal processing
this stunning

302
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,600 
in preparing the audio the tapes so

303
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,840 
let's just take a walk into the control
room and see what we see

304
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,710 
well this is the control room issues for
camera switching its

305
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,169 
use for computer editing and also audio
control

306
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,690 
you can see the monitors and these are
used for the

307
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,660 
camera switching and and this is the
computer editing

308
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,640 
console that use for online and offline
computer editing

309
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,600 
but I really want to demonstrate though
in a context to the lecture is the audio

310
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,150 
control panel

311
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,710 
which contains among other things a
variety of filters for high frequency

312
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,059 
low frequencies cetera basically
equalization

313
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:18,850 
filters and what we have in the way of
filtering is

314
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,679 
first of all a was referred to as a
graphic equalizer

315
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,440 
which consists of a set a bandpass
filters which are described

316
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,809 
little more carefully in a minute and
then also

317
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,809 
and audio Control Panel which is down
here

318
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,910 
and which contains separate equalizer
circuits for each

319
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,400 
over a whole set of channels and also
lotsa controls on them

320
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,110 
well let me begin in the demonstration
by

321
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,880 
demonstrating a little bit of what the
graphic equalizer does

322
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,820 
okay well what we have is a set a
bandpass filters

323
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,010 
and what's indicated appear the center
frequencies as the filters

324
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,440 
and then a slider switch reach 18 Lexus
attenuator amplify

325
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,880 
and this is a DP scale so essentially

326
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,309 
if you look across this banker filters

327
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,840 
with the output olaf for the equalizer
just being the summer the outputs from

328
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,770 
you to these filters interestingly the
position the slider switches as you move

329
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,070 
across here

330
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,960 
in effect shows you what the frequency
response to the equalizer is

331
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,610 
so you can change the overall shaping
I'll

332
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,429 
the filter by moving the switches up and
down all right now the equalizer is

333
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,200 
outlets

334
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,450 
put the equaliser into the circuit and
now I I put in this filtering

335
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,789 
characteristic

336
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,660 
and what I'd like to demonstrate is
filtering

337
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,740 
with this when we do things that are a
little more dramatic than what would

338
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,650 
normally be done in a typical audio
recordings setting

339
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,690 
and to do this let's add to my voice to
music too

340
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,510 
make it more interesting a not the my
voice is an interesting as it is

341
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,669 
but in any case let's bring some music
up

342
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:09,380 
and now what all do is

343
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,809 
set the low frequencies flat and let me
take out the high frequencies

344
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,020 
above eight hundred cycle and

345
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,950 
so now we have affectively is the
low-pass filter it

346
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,740 
and now the low-pass filter let me know

347
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,130 
bring the high is backup

348
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,320 
and so on bringing up those bandpass
filters

349
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,520 
and now let me cut-out the lows

350
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,230 
and you'll hear the lows disappearing
and in effect

351
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,870 
keeping the highest affectively
Crispin's

352
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,070 
the sound my voice music

353
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:56,770 
and finally let me go back 20db
equalization I need to the filters

354
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,200 
and what also to now is

355
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,860 
take the equalizer out at the circuit
totally

356
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,100 
now let's take a look at the audio
Master Control Panel

357
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,510 
and this panel has of course

358
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,190 
for each channel and for example channel
that we're working on

359
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,780 
a volume control I can turn the volume
down

360
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,020 
and I can turn the volume up and

361
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,870 
it also has a set for this particular
equalizer circuit

362
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,070 
it has a set love 3 bandpass filters

363
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,400 
and not switch lettuce either

364
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,429 
put in up to 12 the be gain

365
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:42,480 
or 12 DB attenuation in each of the
bands

366
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,470 
and also a selector switch the lights is
select the center the band

367
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,280 
so let me Jess a again demonstrate a
little bit with this and

368
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,340 
let's get a closeup of this panel so
what we have is i indicated

369
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,870 
is 3 bandpass filters and these knobs
that I'm pointing to hear

370
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,070 
are controls that allow us to reach the
filters to put in

371
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,650 
up to 12 dB gain or 12 dB attenuation

372
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,010 
there are also with the to the filters a
selector switch

373
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,190 
that lets us adjust the center frequency
the filter basically it's a

374
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,350 
to position switch they're also as you
can see is

375
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,830 
a button dead Lexus either put the
equalization in or out

376
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,820 
currently the equalization is out but
put the equalization in

377
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,850 
we won't be here any effect from that
because the game controls are all set at

378
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,270 
0db

379
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,090 
and I want to illustrate shortly the
effective these but before I do let me

380
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,700 
draw your attention

381
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,059 
to one other filter which is

382
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,700 
this white switch and this this which

383
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,240 
is a high pass filter that essentially

384
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,419 
cuts out frequencies below about a
hundred cycle so what it means is that

385
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,850 
but put this which in everything is more
or less flat above a hundred cycles

386
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,679 
and what that's used for basically is to
eliminate

387
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,799 
perhaps 60 cycle noise if that's present
or some

388
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,090 
low-frequency home or whatever well we
won't

389
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,190 
really demonstrate anything with that
let so now with the equalization and

390
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,630 
demonstrate the effect I'll

391
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,260 
boosting or attenuating the low and high
frequencies

392
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,700 
and again I think for to demonstrate
this it's

393
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,400 
it illustrates the point the best if a
if we have a little background music so

394
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,049 
maestro if you can bring that up

395
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:44,429 
and so now I'm gonna do is first

396
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,850 
whose the low frequencies and that's
what this

397
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,090 
potentiometer knob will do so now I'll

398
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,419 
increasing the low-frequency game

399
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,200 
and in fact all the way up to 12 the be
when I have the novel

400
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,200 
was liza going here and so that has a
very basic

401
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,139 
sounding back

402
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:06,230 
make it even base you're fighting

403
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,750 
my sees and

404
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,010 
attenuating knows by

405
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,930 
well

406
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,300 
okay well leads words some the
high-frequency

407
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,590 
back in

408
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,659 
in now let's turn the low-frequency

409
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,500 
game offers back down

410
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,270 
20 and now we're back to flat
equalization

411
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,870 
and now I can turn the low-frequency
game down

412
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,200 
so dead attenuate the low frequencies by
as much as 12 the

413
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,550 
that's where we are now in service

414
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:48,049 
force much first

415
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:54,970 
to enhance the highs even more hike in
addition coming out who's the highs

416
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,410 
by his

417
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,770 
okay well let's turn down the music now
and

418
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:10,850 
and go back to no equalization by
setting these knives 20 dB in fact we

419
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,380 
can take the equalizer out

420
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,170 
well thats a quick look at some
real-world filters

421
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,800 
now let's the stop having so much fun
and

422
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,800 
let's go back to the lecture okay well

423
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,570 
thats a little behind the scenes look
but I'd

424
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,080 
like to do now is turn our attention to

425
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,080 
discrete-time filters and

426
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,530 
as i've mentioned in previous lectures
their are

427
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,970 
basically two classes

428
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,990 
love discrete-time filters or discrete
time difference equations

429
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,260 
one class is referred to

430
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,180 
as a nonrecourse ive or moving average

431
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,270 
filter and the basic idea

432
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,350 
with the moving average filter is
something that perhaps your

433
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,710 
some what familiar with intuitively
think I've the notion

434
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,190 
I love taking that data sequence and

435
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,190 
let's suppose that what we wanted to do
was apply a some smoothing to the data

436
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,030 
sequence

437
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,930 
we could for example think taking
adjacent points

438
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,850 
averaging them together and then moving
that average

439
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,780 
along the data sequence what you can
kinda see intuitively

440
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,120 
is that that would have apply some
smoothing so in fact

441
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,390 
the difference equation let's say for a
three-point moving average

442
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,640 
would be the difference equation that I
indicate here

443
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,900 
just simply taking a data point

444
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,980 
and the two data points adjacent to it

445
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,170 
and forming an average over those three

446
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,680 
so if we thought if the kinda processing
involved

447
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,450 
if performing an output sequence value

448
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,230 
we would take three adjacent points an
average though

449
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,110 
that would give us the output at The
Associated time

450
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,950 
and then to compute the next output
point we were just simply slide this

451
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,140 
by a one-point average these together
and that would give us the next output

452
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,660 
point and we would continue along

453
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,720 
just simply sliding in averaging

454
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,670 
to form the output data sequence now

455
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,330 
that's an example love what's commonly
referred to as a three-point moving

456
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,060 
average

457
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,080 
in fact we can generalize that notion

458
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,150 
in a number of ways one-way generalizing

459
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,400 
the notion over moving average from the
three-point moving average which I

460
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,460 
summarize again here is to think or
extending that

461
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,950 
to a larger number of points and in fact

462
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,290 
applying waits to that as i indicate
here

463
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,870 
so that in addition to just summing up
the points and dividing by the number of

464
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,970 
points on

465
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,120 
we can in fact apply individual weights
to the points

466
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,680 
so that its what is often referred to as
awaiting

467
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,870 
with moving average and I show

468
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,150 
below one possible kind of curve

469
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,390 
that might result where these would-be

470
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,090 
essentially the weights Associated with
this waited

471
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,700 
moving average and in fact its easy to
verify

472
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,480 
that this indeed corresponds to the
impulse response

473
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,860 
the filter well just two

474
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,200 
cement this notion let me show you an
example or two

475
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,600 
here is an example all a

476
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,990 
five-point moving average a five-point
moving average

477
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,120 
would have an impulse response dead

478
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,280 
just consists of a rectangle Lovelinks 5

479
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,380 
and if this is convolved with the data
sequence that would corresponding

480
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,410 
correspond to taking five adjacent
points and in effect averaging them

481
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,130 
we've looked previously at the quarry a
transformer this rectangular sequence

482
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,850 
and the forty a transformer that in fact

483
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,740 
is all the form of a sign an axe over

484
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,050 
sin x kar and as you can see

485
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,620 
that is so approximation to

486
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,790 
a low-pass filter and so this again is

487
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,340 
a the impulse response and frequency
response

488
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,410 
all a non-ideal low-pass filter

489
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,680 
now there are a variety of both

490
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,700 
algorithms that in fact tell you how to
choose the weights

491
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,170 
associated with the waiting weighted
moving average

492
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,500 
to in some sense design better
approximations

493
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,510 
and without going into the details love
any of those algorithms

494
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,340 
let me just show the results of choosing
the weights

495
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,990 
for the design over 250 first 251 points

496
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,110 
moving average filter where the weights

497
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,680 
are chosen using an optimum algorithm to
generate a sharp a cut-off

498
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,610 
as can possibly be generated and so what
I show here

499
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,620 
is the frequency response

500
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,010 
that the resulting filter on a
logarithmic ample to scale

501
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,860 
in a linear frequency scale noticed that
on this scale the pass band is very flat

502
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,990 
although here is an expanded you all
that and in fact it

503
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,350 
has was referred to as an equal ripple
characteristic

504
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,060 
and then here's the transition band and
here we have to stop and

505
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,820 
which in fact is down somewhat more than
80 dB

506
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,750 
and again has what's referred to as an
equal ripple characterised

507
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,640 
now the notion of a moving average

508
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,530 
for filtering is something dead is very
commonly

509
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,820 
use I a head shown last time actually
the result

510
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,120 
some filtering on a particular data
sequence the Dow Jones Industrial

511
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,280 
Average

512
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,720 
and very often in

513
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,500 
looking at various kinds a stock market
publications

514
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,790 
what you will see is this the Dow Jones
average

515
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,370 
shown in its raw form as a data sequence
and then very typically

516
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,780 
you you'll see also: the result all

517
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,980 
moving average where the moving average
might

518
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,150 
be on the order love days or it might be
on the order

519
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,340 
months the whole notion being to take

520
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,680 
some other random high frequency
fluctuations

521
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,870 
out at the average and show the
low-frequency

522
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,110 
or trends over

523
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,410 
some period of time so let's

524
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,560 
in fact go back to the Dow Jones average
and

525
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,350 
let me now show you what the result of
filtering

526
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,000 
with a moving average filter would look
like

527
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,580 
on the Seder same Dow Jones Industrial
Average sequence that I showed last time

528
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:07,380 
so once again we have the Dow Jones
average from 1927 to roughly 1932

529
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,060 
at the top we see the impulse response
for the moving average

530
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,490 
again I remind you on an expanded time
scale

531
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,629 
and was shown here is the moving average
with just one point

532
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,050 
so the output on the bottom trace is

533
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,960 
just simply identical to the input now
let's increase the link to the moving

534
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,909 
average 22 points and we see that
there's a small amount of smoothing

535
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,419 
three points and just a little more
smoothing pickets inserted

536
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:41,190 
now a four-point moving average

537
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,149 
and next the five-point moving average

538
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,659 
and a six-point moving average next we
see that the smoothing increases

539
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,210 
now let's increase the link to the
moving average filter much more rapidly

540
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,760 
and watch how the output is

541
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,330 
more and more smooth in relation to the
input

542
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,740 
again i emphasize that the timescale

543
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,760 
for the impulse response is
significantly expanded in relationship

544
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,470 
to the timescale for both the input in
the output

545
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,630 
and once again through the magic of
filtering we've been able to eliminate

546
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,510 
the 1929 stock market crash

547
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,530 
alright so we've seen moving average
filters

548
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,990 
and or what are sometimes referred to as

549
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,430 
non workers is filters and

550
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,530 
they are as I stressed very important
class

551
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,560 
discreet I filters another

552
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,560 
very important class of discrete-time
filters are

553
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,500 
what are referred to as rehearses
filters

554
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,400 
workers the filters are filters that for
which the difference equation

555
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,960 
has feedback from the output back

556
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,090 
into the input in other words the output

557
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:06,910 
depends not only on the input but also
on previous values if the output

558
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,040 
so for example as i stress previously

559
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,170 
a rikers a difference equation has

560
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,560 
the general form that I indicate year

561
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,100 
a linear combination love waited outputs
on the left hand side and linear

562
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,950 
combination

563
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,500 
waited inputs on the right hand side and

564
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,960 
as we talked about we can solve this
equation

565
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,580 
for the current output why I have an
interns a

566
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,830 
of current and past inputs and passed
out

567
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,630 
what's for example just two

568
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,960 
interpret this focus on the
interpretation of this is a filter

569
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,670 
let's looking at a first-order
difference equation which

570
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,770 
we've talked about and generated the
solution to previously

571
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,870 
so the first-order a first 30 difference
equation

572
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,200 
would be as i indicated here

573
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,230 
and imposing causality on this

574
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:07,650 
so that we assume that we are running
this is a recursion forward in time

575
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,130 
we can solve this for why I have an
intern's affects it man

576
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,430 
and why I have and -1 waited

577
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,430 
by the factor a and I simply indicate

578
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,190 
the block diagram for this but what we
want to examine now

579
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,370 
for this first order recursion is the
frequency response and see its

580
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,520 
interpretation

581
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,890 
as a filter well in fact again

582
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:37,570 
the mathematics for this we've gone
through in the last lecture

583
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,420 
and so interpreting the first-order
difference equation as a system

584
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,290 
we can what what we're attempting to

585
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,320 
generate is the frequency response

586
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,770 
which is the forty a transformer the
impulse response

587
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,690 
and from the difference equation we can
of course all

588
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,109 
for either one of those by using the
properties exploiting the properties in

589
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:07,350 
for EA transform applying to 48
transport to the difference equation

590
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,550 
we will end up with the forty a
transformer the output

591
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,000 
equal to the Fourier transform the input
times this factor which

592
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,190 
we know from the convolution property in
fact

593
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,880 
is the frequency response

594
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,450 
of the system so this is the frequency
response

595
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,290 
and of course the inverse Fourier
transform a bad

596
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,290 
which I E indicate below

597
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,910 
is the system impulse response

598
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,060 
so we have the frequency response
obtained by

599
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,250 
applying to free a transformed to the
difference equation the impulse response

600
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,270 
and as we did last time we can

601
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,900 
look at that interns love

602
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,030 
a frequency response characteristic

603
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,310 
and recall that depending on whether

604
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,100 
the factor A is positive or negative we
need to get

605
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,859 
a low-pass filter or a high pass filter

606
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,890 
and if in fact we look at the frequency
response

607
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:17,870 
for the factor a being positive then we
see that this is an approximation

608
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:24,600 
to a low-pass filter who wears below it
I showed the frequency response

609
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,220 
for a negative & mare the

610
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,470 
this corresponds to a way high pass
filter because we're attenuating

611
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,730 
low frequencies and retaining

612
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,930 
the high frequencies in and

613
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,530 
recall also that we illustrated

614
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:48,720 
this this characteristic as a low-pass
high-pass filter for the recursion

615
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,570 
for the first-order recursion by by
looking at

616
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,970 
how it work as a filter in both cases

617
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,560 
when the input was the Dow Jones average
and indeed we saw that

618
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,840 
it generated both low-pass and high-pass
filtering

619
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,040 
in in the appropriate cases so for
discrete-time

620
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,400 
we have the two classes moving average
and

621
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,920 
a cursive filters and

622
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,080 
and there are a variety of issues
discussed in the text about why

623
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,070 
in certain contexts one might want to
use one or the other basically what

624
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,770 
happens

625
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,380 
is dead for the moving average filter

626
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,270 
for a given set a filter specifications
there are many more multiplications

627
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,640 
required in for a cursive filter by

628
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,880 
there are in certain contexts some very
important compensating benefits

629
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,470 
the moving average filter

630
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,750 
now this concludes pretty much

631
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,170 
what I A want to say in detail

632
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,870 
about filtering the concept filtering in
this set of lectures

633
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,700 
this is only a very quick glimpse into

634
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,640 
a very important and very rich topic and
one of course that

635
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,260 
can be studied on its own in
considerable amount of detail

636
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,440 
as the lectures go online what will find

637
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,760 
is that the basic concept to filtering
both

638
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,350 
ideal and non-ideal filtering will will

639
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,190 
be a very important part love what we do

640
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,250 
and in in particular

641
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,350 
beginning with the next lecture will
turn to

642
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,500 
a discussion of modulation exploiting

643
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,359 
the property modulation as it relates to
some practical problems

644
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,400 
and what will find when we do that is
that

645
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,730 
a very important part of that discussion
and in fact the very important part

646
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,910 
love the use of modulation also

647
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,080 
just naturally incorporates the concept

648
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,580 
and properties filtering thank you
