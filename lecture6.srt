the norm

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:52,050 
are

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,250 
over the past several lectures we've
developed the representation for linear

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:60,800 
time-invariant systems

13
00:00:60,800 --> 00:01:04,510 
in a particularly important center
systems

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,770 
which are linear and time-invariant are
those that are represented by linear

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,480 
constant coefficient differential
equations continuous-time

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,100 
or when your constant coefficient
difference equations

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,350 
in discrete-time for example electrical
circuits that are built let's say I dove

18
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,590 
resistors inductors and capacitors
perhaps with %ah pants

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,790 
correspond to systems described by
differential equations

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,540 
mechanical systems with springs and dash
pots likewise

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,160 
are described by differential equations
and in the discrete-time

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,250 
case things such as moving average
filters

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,280 
digital filters and most simple kinda
data smoothing

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,930 
are all linear constant coefficient
difference equations

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,050 
now presumably

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,750 
in a previous course you've had some
exposure to

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,000 
differential equations for
continuous-time and

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,030 
their solution using notions like
particular solution and homogeneous

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,280 
solution initial conditions center

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,920 
later on in the course

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,610 
when we've developed the concept to the
48 transforming after that the

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,030 
apostrophe its form

33
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,940 
will see some very efficient and useful
ways

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,320 
generating solutions both differential
and difference equations

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,680 
at this point however I'd like to

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,830 
just introduce when your constant
coefficient

37
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,690 
differential equations and the
discrete-time counterpart

38
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,860 
and address among other things the issue

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,220 
love when they do and don't correspond
to linear time-invariant systems

40
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,730 
well let's first consider

41
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,010 
what I refer to as an nth order

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,590 
linear constant coefficients
differential equation as i've indicated

43
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,630 
here

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,590 
and what it consists of is a linear
combination of derivatives up the system

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,380 
output

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,800 
y'at equal to a linear combination

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,930 
of derivatives above the system input
accept T

48
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,960 
and is referred to

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,500 
as a constant coefficients equation of
course because the

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,220 
coefficients are constant in other words
not assume to be time-varying

51
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,280 
and its referred to

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,550 
as linear because it corresponds to a
linear combination

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,320 
love these derivatives not because

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,430 
it corresponds to a linear system and in
fact

55
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,880 
as we'll see or as all indicate this

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,180 
equation may or may not in fact
correspond to

57
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,650 
when your system in the discrete-time
case

58
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,190 
the corresponding equation is a linear
constant coefficient difference equation

59
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,610 
and that corresponds to again

60
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,800 
a linear combination love the late
versions of the output equal to

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240 
a linear combination love the late
versions at the input

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,390 
this equation is referred to as an nth
order

63
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,060 
difference equation the N referring to
the number of the ladies

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,860 
are the output involved just as an aunt
order differential equation

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,009 
the N for the order the equation refers
to the number of derivatives

66
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,860 
the output now let's first begin

67
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,620 
with the near constant coefficient
differential equations

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,590 
and the basic

69
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,630 
point or the solution for

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,080 
the differential equations is the fact
dead

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,160 
if we've generated some solution

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,360 
which I refer to here's why superiority
some solution

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,820 
to the equation for a given input then

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,960 
in fact we can and to that solution

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,090 
any other solution which

76
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,699 
satisfies what's referred to as

77
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,320 
the homogeneous equation so in fact

78
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,180 
this differential equation by itself

79
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,199 
is not a unique specification

80
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,329 
the system

81
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,429 
if I have any solution then I can

82
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:18,729 
and to that solution any other solution
which satisfies the homogeneous equation

83
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,159 
and thus all those two

84
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,399 
likewise be a solution and that's very
straight forward to verify

85
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,319 
by simply substituting into the
differential equation

86
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,389 
some love the particular a particular
and the homogeneous solution

87
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,869 
and what you see is that the homogeneous
contribution

88
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,179 
in fact goes to zero by definition

89
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:45,189 
what we mean by the homogeneous equation
now

90
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,839 
the homogeneous solution for a when your
constant coefficient differential

91
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,659 
equation

92
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,169 
is of the form that I

93
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,739 
indicate at the bottom and

94
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,869 
it typically consists love a

95
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:06,679 
song or capital and complex exponentials

96
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,799 
and the Constance

97
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,859 
are on determined by the equation itself

98
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:17,089 
and this form for the homogeneous
solution

99
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:22,209 
in essence drops out love examining

100
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,549 
the homogeneous equation where

101
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:30,429 
if we assume that the former the
homogeneous solution

102
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:34,209 
is a complex exponential with some

103
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:38,229 
on specified amplitude and unspecified
exponent

104
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,369 
if we substitute this into are
homogeneous equation

105
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,619 
we end up with the equation that i've
indicated

106
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:49,629 
year the factor A&E the st. can in fact
be

107
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,610 
cancelled out and we find there that
equation

108
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,180 
is satisfied

109
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,300 
for capital N values

110
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,860 
love s and

111
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,410 
that's true no matter what choices made
for these

112
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,410 
coefficients and the essential
consequence

113
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,880 
have all of that is that the homogeneous
solution

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,650 
is of the form that I indicated
previously

115
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,890 
namely it consists love some

116
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,820 
love capital and complex exponentials

117
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,650 
where the coefficients the capital and
coefficients

118
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,770 
attached to you to those complex
exponentials

119
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,969 
is undetermined Iran specified

120
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,209 
so what this says is that in order to

121
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,629 
obtain the solution for a win here comes
the coefficient differential equation

122
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,719 
we need some kind of auxiliary
information

123
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,779 
tells us how to obtain these capital and

124
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:53,719 
undetermined Constance and there are a
variety of ways

125
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,669 
specifying this auxiliary information or
auxiliary conditions

126
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,059 
for example in addition to the
differential equation

127
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:05,769 
what I can tell you is the value

128
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,860 
of the output and and -1 up there

129
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,309 
and -1 if its derivatives at some

130
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,899 
specified time t0 and

131
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,860 
so the differential equations together

132
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,459 
with the auxiliary information the
initial conditions

133
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,860 
van lets you determine the total
solution

134
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,429 
which namely lets you determine these
previously unspecified

135
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:35,130 
coefficients in the homogeneous solution

136
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,380 
now depending on how the auxiliary
information is stated or what auxiliary

137
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,979 
information is available

138
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,750 
the system a or may not correspond

139
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,680 
to a linear system and may or may not
correspond to a linear time-invariant

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,200 
system one essential condition

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,649 
for it to correspond to a linear system
is that

142
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,339 
the initial conditions must be zero

143
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,020 
and one can see the reason for that

144
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,850 
if we refer back to the previous lecture
in which we saw that for a linear system

145
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,850 
if we put 0n we get zero out

146
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,330 
so if exit see the input is zero the
output must be zero

147
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,959 
and so that in essence tells us that at
least for the system to be linear

148
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,959 
these initial conditions must be zero

149
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,410 
now beyond that if

150
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,510 
we want the system to be

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,630 
causal and linear time in and
time-invariant

152
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,920 
then what's required on the

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,600 
initial conditions is that they be
consistent with

154
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,959 
what's referred to as initial rest
initial arrest says

155
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,200 
that the output must be

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,420 
0 up until the time

157
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,190 
that the input becomes 90 and we can see

158
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,540 
of course that that's consistent with
the notion of causality as

159
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,350 
we talked about in the previous lecture
and

160
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,589 
its relatively straightforward to see

161
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,390 
that if the system is causal and linear
and time-invariant

162
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,550 
that will require

163
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,370 
initial rest it's somewhat more
difficult see

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,420 
that if we specify initial rest the NAT
in fact is sufficient to

165
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,870 
determine that the system is both causal
in linear

166
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,420 
and time very but the essential point
then is that

167
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,750 
requires initial rest for both linearity

168
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,270 
and causality okay well

169
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,800 
let's look at an example and

170
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,190 
let's take the example love a
first-order

171
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,470 
differential equation as I've

172
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,510 
indicated here so we have

173
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,000 
a first-order differential equation the
wife TTT

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,130 
was a yote is the input exit

175
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,160 
T and let's first

176
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,520 
look at what the homogeneous solution
this equation is

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,170 
and so we can consider the homogeneous
equation

178
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,010 
namely the equation specify solutions

179
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,320 
which would correspond to zero input

180
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,520 
we in essence guess for impose

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,690 
a solution love the form the homogeneous
solution

182
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,100 
is an amplitude factor times the complex
exponential

183
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,320 
substituting this into the homogeneous
equation

184
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,590 
we then get the equation that i've
indicated here

185
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,930 
what you can see is that this equates in
this equation

186
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,840 
I can cancel out the amplitude factor
and this complex exponential

187
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,160 
so let's just cancel those out on both
sides of the equation

188
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,300 
and what we're left with is an equation

189
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,510 
that specifies what the complex exponent
must be

190
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,620 
in particular for the homogeneous
solution s must be equal to minus a

191
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,780 
and so finally are homogeneous solution

192
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,629 
is as I've indicated year

193
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:24,009 
okay now let's look at the solution for
specific input let's consider for

194
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,229 
example input

195
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,639 
which is a scale units step and

196
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,209 
although I won't work at the solution in
detail and perhaps

197
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,029 
using what you've worked on previously

198
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,579 
you know how to carry out the solution
for that the

199
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,669 
a solution with step input

200
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:47,669 
is what i've indicated here scaler one
minus the next financial times unit

201
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:51,949 
staff and you can verify that simply by
substituting into the differential

202
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,809 
equations now

203
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,899 
we know that there's a family of
solutions in other words

204
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,959 
any solution with

205
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,729 
a homogeneous solution added to it is
again a solution

206
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:09,499 
and so if we consider the solution I
just indicated

207
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:13,169 
we generate the entire family of
solutions by

208
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:16,459 
ending a homogeneous solution to it and
so

209
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,379 
this then corresponds to the entire
family of solutions

210
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,659 
where the constant a is unspecified

211
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:31,470 
so far and needs to be specified through
some type avoids avery conditions

212
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,549 
now a class A auxiliary conditions

213
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,779 
is the Commissioner initial rest which

214
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:43,749 
as i indicated before is equivalent to
the statement that the system

215
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:47,489 
is causal and linear and time-invariant
and

216
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:51,309 
in that case for the initial rest
condition

217
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,139 
we would then require in this equation
above

218
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,059 
that this constant be equal to 0

219
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,429 
and so finally the response

220
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:05,739 
to scales step if the system

221
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:09,289 
is the correspond to cause a linear
time-invariant system

222
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:12,589 
is then just this term namely

223
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:15,799 
constant times one minus an exponential

224
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,620 
times step

225
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,260 
okay now if the system is a linear
time-invariant system

226
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,810 
it can as we know be described through
its impulse response

227
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,120 
and as you've worked out previously

228
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,399 
in the video course manual for

229
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,140 
a linear time-invariant system the
impulse response

230
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,560 
is the derivative love the step response
adjusted quickly remind you

231
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,829 
love where that result comes from in
essence

232
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,470 
we can consider to linear time-invariant
systems and Cascade

233
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,260 
wanna differentiator the other the
system that we're talking about

234
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,620 
described by

235
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,980 
the differential equation and step in
here

236
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,370 
then generated in polls into our system

237
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,190 
and out comes the impulse response well
just using the fact that

238
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,540 
these are both linear time-invariant
systems and they can be cascaded in

239
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,420 
either order

240
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,430 
then means that if we have step response

241
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,820 
to our system and that goes through
differentiator

242
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,600 
what must come out again is the impulse
response

243
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,940 
so differentiating the step response we
get the impulse response

244
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,459 
here again is the step response as we

245
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,459 
just worked it out this time for you
next step if we differentiate

246
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,769 
we have then since the step response

247
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:44,660 
is the product of two terms the
derivative a product is the sum

248
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,490 
the derivatives and carrying that
algebra through

249
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,860 
and using the fact that the derivative
the step

250
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,170 
is an impulse finally we come down

251
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,750 
to this statement for the impulse
response

252
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,899 
and then recognizing that this is but
I'm

253
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,949 
function times and in polls and we know

254
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:08,660 
that a time function times in polls
takes on

255
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,040 
the value at the time that the impulse
occurs

256
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,360 
then this term is simply 0

257
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,610 
and the impulse response then

258
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,910 
finally is an exponential this for

259
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,000 
and this is the peking exponential for a
positive

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240 
it's a growing exponentially for a
negative and

261
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,709 
recall that as we talked about
previously

262
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,430 
a system is a linear time-invariant
system is stable

263
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,310 
if its impulse response is absolutely
integral

264
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,000 
for this particular case this impulse
response

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,070 
is absolutely integral provided that

266
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,430 
the exponential factor a

267
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,960 
is greater than 0

268
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,130 
okay so what we've seen then is the

269
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:07,220 
impulse response for system described by
a linear constant coefficient

270
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,600 
differential equation

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,810 
where in addition we will impose
causality

272
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,760 
when you're ready in time invariance
essentially through the initial

273
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,580 
conditions

274
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,539 
love initial rest

275
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,389 
now pretty much the same kinds of things
happen

276
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,839 
with difference equations as we've gone
through

277
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,730 
with differential equations in
particular

278
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,850 
again let me remind you love the form
love

279
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,320 
and aunt order when your constant
coefficient difference equation

280
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,490 
its as I indicate here and

281
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,059 
again a linear combination this time the
late versions of the output equal to a

282
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,230 
linear combination

283
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,559 
up the late versions love the input once
again

284
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,770 
the difference equation is not

285
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,190 
a complete specification the system
because we can and to the response

286
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,660 
any homogeneous solution in other words

287
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,340 
any solution that satisfies the
homogeneous equation

288
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,000 
in the summer those well also satisfy
the original

289
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,519 
difference equation so if we have

290
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,380 
a particular response that satisfies

291
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,289 
the difference equation then ending to
that

292
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:31,039 
any response there is a solution to the
homogeneous equation

293
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,630 
will also be a solution to the total
equation

294
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,340 
the homogeneous solution again is of the
form

295
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,190 
of a linear combination of exponentials
here

296
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,190 
we have the homogeneous equation as with

297
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,649 
differential equations we can

298
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,820 
guests or impose solutions for

299
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,409 
eight times an exponential when we
substitute this

300
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,710 
into the homogeneous equation we then
end up

301
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,289 
with equation that i've indicated here
we recognize again

302
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,799 
there a the amplitude

303
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,070 
and seats at the end

304
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,149 
this exponential factor cancel out

305
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,220 
and so this equation is satisfied

306
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,200 
for any values love see

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,000 
that satisfy this equation and

308
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,009 
there are and roots C-one through Z and

309
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,909 
and so finally the form for the
homogeneous solution

310
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:42,440 
is a linear combination love capital and

311
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,120 
exponentials capital and is the order
the equation

312
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,809 
with each of those exponentials the
ample to factor is undetermined

313
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,480 
and needs to be determined in some way
through

314
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,549 
the imposition love appropriate

315
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,010 
initial conditions are boundary
conditions

316
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,050 
so the general form then

317
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,190 
for the solution to the difference
equation

318
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,210 
is

319
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,899 
some with the exponentials plus any
particular solution

320
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:20,580 
its through auxiliary conditions that we
determine

321
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,610 
these coefficients we have

322
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,490 
and undetermined coefficients and so

323
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,909 
we require capital and auxiliary
conditions

324
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,500 
for example some set values

325
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,639 
of the output at and this thing instance

326
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,220 
time

327
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,080 
now this

328
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,350 
was the same as with differential
equations in the case a differential

329
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,590 
equations we talked about specifying

330
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,210 
the value of the output and its
derivatives and

331
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,370 
there we indicated dead for linearity

332
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,670 
what we required when the arity what we
require

333
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,080 
is that the auxiliary conditions 30

334
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,650 
and the same thing applies here for the
same reason

335
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,910 
namely if the system is to be linear and
the response if there's no input must be

336
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,460 
equal to 0

337
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,800 
in addition what

338
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,760 
we may want to impose on the system is

339
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,200 
that it be causal and in addition to
linear

340
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,750 
time-invariant and with that requires
again

341
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,700 
is that it the auxiliary conditions be
consistent with

342
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,810 
initial rest namely that if

343
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,150 
the input is zero prior to some time

344
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,409 
in the output is zero prior to the same
time

345
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,429 
okay so we've seen a very direct
parallel

346
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,730 
so far between differential equations

347
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,230 
and difference equations

348
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,600 
in fact one difference between them dead

349
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,770 
in some sense makes difference equations

350
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,100 
easier to deal with in some situations
is dead

351
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,030 
in contrast to a differential equation a

352
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,040 
difference equation if we assume
causality

353
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,640 
in fact is and explicit

354
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,860 
input-output relationship for the system
now let me

355
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,669 
show you what I mean

356
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,190 
let's consider the n-th order difference
equation as i've indicated here

357
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,010 
and let's assume that we're imposing
causality

358
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,679 
so there'd the output can only depend

359
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,000 
on prior values at the input and
therefore on fire values at the output

360
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,020 
well we can simply rearrange this
equation

361
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,640 
solving for Y have an the leading term
with cable 0

362
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,500 
taking all the other turns over to the
right side of the equation

363
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,659 
and we then have a workers if equation

364
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:58,030 
namely that an equation expresses the
output interns

365
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,679 
love prior values if the input which is
this term

366
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,660 
and prior values at the output

367
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,190 
and so if in fact we have this equation
running

368
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,660 
then once it started we know how to
compute

369
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,720 
the output for the next time

370
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,749 
well

371
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:21,059 
how do we get started the way we get it
started of course

372
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,119 
is through the appropriate said love

373
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,549 
initial conditions are boundary
conditions and if for example

374
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,129 
we assume initial rest corresponding to
a causal when you're time-invariant

375
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,190 
system

376
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,579 
then if the input is zero up until
sometime

377
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:40,909 
the output must be zero up until that
time and Matt in essence

378
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,989 
helps us get the equation started well
let's look at this

379
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,619 
specifically in the context love a

380
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,679 
first-order difference equation so let's
take

381
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,799 
a first-order difference equation

382
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,580 
as i've indicated here

383
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,980 
and so we have an equation that tells us
that why I have and minus eight times

384
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,500 
wider than -1

385
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,760 
is equal to exit

386
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760 
now if we want this to correspond to

387
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,530 
a causal linear time-invariant system we

388
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,420 
oppose initial impose initial rest on it
we can

389
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,160 
rewrite the first-order difference
equation by taking

390
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,280 
the term involving y ven -1

391
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,230 
over to the right hand side of the
equation

392
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,210 
right now this gives us a workers if
equation

393
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,070 
that expresses the output interns the
input and past values at the output

394
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,370 
and since we've impose causality

395
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,150 
and if we're talking about a linear
time-invariant system

396
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,960 
we can now inquire as to what the
impulse responses and we know of course

397
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,440 
that the impulse response

398
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,609 
charles is everything that we need to
know about the system

399
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:01,309 
okay so let's shoes and input which is

400
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,709 
an impulse so the impulse response

401
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:08,099 
is Beltre van corresponding

402
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:11,789 
to the exit and appear plus eighty Delta

403
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,749 
love this should be a chip N -1

404
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:20,650 
and let me just correct that this is a
chip N -1

405
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,050 
so we have the impulse response as Delta
van

406
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,470 
was eight times a Japan -1

407
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,620 
now from initial rest we know

408
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,630 
bad since the input namely an impulse is
0 for and less than zero

409
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,140 
the impulse response is likewise 0

410
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,180 
for and less 0 and now

411
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,350 
let's work out what 80 its well

412
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,860 
80 with an equal 0 is

413
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,290 
delta up zero plus eight times

414
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,740 
a chip N -1 HRN minus 10

415
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:04,740 
and so h0 is equal to 1

416
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,370 
okay now that we have a chance 0 we can
figure at H

417
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,750 
one by running this recursive equations

418
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,510 
so 8 you've won is

419
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,720 
Delta love one which is zero

420
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,310 
plus eight times h0 which we just
figured out as one

421
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,810 
so HR one is equal to a and if we carry
this through

422
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:32,030 
will have a chip to equal to a squared
and

423
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,530 
this will continue on and in fact we can
recognize

424
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,370 
by looking at this and how we would
expect these terms to build

425
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,100 
we would see that the impulse response a
Japan

426
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,160 
in fact -ism form a to the end times

427
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,659 
you have an

428
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,019 
and we also can recognize then dead

429
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:58,720 
this corresponds to stable system

430
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,800 
if and only if the impulse response

431
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,300 
which is what we just figured out if and
only if the impulse response

432
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,100 
is absolutely so noble and what that
will require

433
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:17,039 
is that the magnitude a the less

434
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,899 
okay now we impose causality linear
ready in time invariance

435
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,210 
and generated a solution recur simply

436
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,590 
and now of course if we want to generate
the more general

437
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,610 
center solutions to this difference
equation

438
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,500 
we can't do that by adding all of the

439
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,529 
homogeneous solutions namely all the
solutions to satisfy the homogeneous

440
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,340 
equation so

441
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,270 
here we have the causal linear
time-invariant

442
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,270 
impulse response in fact

443
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:56,120 
with an impulse input all of the
possible solutions

444
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,480 
are that impulse response plus

445
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,000 
the homogeneous solutions the
homogeneous solution is the solution

446
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,270 
that satisfies the homogeneous equation

447
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,289 
that will in general

448
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,890 
believe the form an amplitude factor

449
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,130 
times an exponential factor and

450
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,130 
if we substitute this into this equation

451
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,149 
then we see that the homogeneous

452
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:27,580 
equation is satisfied for any values
have a

453
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,600 
in any values see that satisfy

454
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,130 
this equation again as we did with
differential equations

455
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:43,130 
the factor Amy cancels out and also in
fact I can cancel out is either the N

456
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,080 
there and seat to the end here

457
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,799 
and so what we're left with is a
statement that tells us

458
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,990 
then dead the homogeneous

459
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,080 
solution is over for AC to the end

460
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,020 
for any ban you capital A and any value

461
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,720 
see it satisfies this equation and

462
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,840 
that values the in particular is the

463
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,159 
people today so the homogeneous solution
then

464
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,779 
is any exponential this form with any
amplitude factor

465
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,669 
and so the family of solutions with an
impulse

466
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:24,120 
input is the solution

467
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,580 
corresponding to the system being cause
a linear and time-invariant

468
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,040 
plus the homogeneous sir

469
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,000 
if

470
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000 
we impose causality Lenny a ready in
time invariance

471
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,820 
on the system then of course that
additional

472
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,510 
exponential factor will be 0 in other
words capital A

473
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,579 
is 0

474
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:53,289 
okay now in we seen the

475
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:56,250 
differential equations and difference
equations interns

476
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,970 
love

477
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,460 
the fact there there are families have
solutions

478
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,090 
and in order to get causality Lenny a
ready in time

479
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,510 
variance requires imposing a particular
set initial conditions namely

480
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,470 
imposing initial rest on the system

481
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,039 
let's now look at the difference
equation

482
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,200 
and then later the differential equation
interpreted in block diagrams

483
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,570 
now p the difference equation at

484
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,440 
I just simply repeated here is why I
have an

485
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,700 
is accident was a white van -1

486
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,830 
where I've taken that the late term

487
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,640 
over to the right hand side of the
equation so in effect

488
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,450 
what on imposing on this system is
causality

489
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,450 
I'm assuming that if I know the past
history

490
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,250 
the input and the output I can determine

491
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,960 
the next value the out

492
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,810 
well we can in fact draw a block diagram

493
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,500 
represents that equation the equation
says

494
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,930 
we take exit and for any given bad you

495
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,390 
a van say n0 whatever bad you were
computing the output were

496
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,870 
we take the input at that time

497
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,429 
and and to it the factor a

498
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,149 
times the output value that we
calculated last time so

499
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:26,700 
if we have excessive and which is our
input

500
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,680 
and if we have why I have and which is
our output

501
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,640 
we in fact can't get why I have an

502
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,480 
by taking the last value why event

503
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,190 
indicated here by putting why I have an

504
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,450 
threw it away multiplying Matt

505
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,050 
by the factor

506
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,310 
a

507
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,080 
and then Anning that result

508
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,809 
to

509
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,960 
the input

510
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,200 
and the result the doing that is

511
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,460 
why event

512
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,500 
so the way this block diagram

513
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,059 
might be interpreted for example as an
algorithm is this a

514
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:17,070 
dead we take exit Van add to it

515
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,030 
eight times the previous value the
output that some gives us

516
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,380 
the current value of the output which we
then put out of the system

517
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,440 
and also put into a delay element or

518
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,240 
basically it was stored register to use
on the next generation a recursion

519
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,130 
now how do we get this started well we
know that the difference equation

520
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,880 
requires initial conditions

521
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,929 
and in fact the initial conditions

522
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,480 
correspond to what we store

523
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,160 
in that the late register when this
block diagram

524
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,320 
equation initially starts up

525
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,700 
okay now let's look at

526
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,320 
this for the case %uh difference
equations

527
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,670 
more generally

528
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:13,280 
so what we said is dead we can calculate
the output by

529
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,770 
having previous values that the input

530
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,440 
previous values at the output and
forming

531
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,490 
the appropriate linear combination so

532
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,559 
let's just build up the more general
block diagram

533
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,890 
that would correspond to this

534
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,730 
and what it says is that we want to have
a mechanism

535
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,470 
restoring past values the input in a
mechanism for story past values at the

536
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:41,990 
output

537
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,440 
and i've indicated that on this figure

538
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,630 
so far by a chain love

539
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,250 
the layout its indicating

540
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,390 
that whatever what

541
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,580 
the output each delay is the input

542
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,450 
delayed by one time it's

543
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,100 
or or interval and so

544
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,619 
what we see down this chain of the
ladies are the late replications

545
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,200 
love the input and what we see

546
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,000 
on the other chain is delayed

547
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,940 
replications love the output

548
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,950 
now the difference equation says that we
want to take these

549
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,169 
and multiply them by the appropriate
coefficients

550
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,899 
the coefficients in the difference
equation and so we can do that

551
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,470 
as i've indicated here so

552
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,010 
now we have these delay elements each
multiplied

553
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,119 
by the appropriate coefficients on the
input and by

554
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,089 
appropriate coefficients on the output
those are then

555
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,579 
songs together and

556
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:59,150 
so we now what's on these and what's on
these

557
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,760 
after we've some these we want to add

558
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,900 
those together and there's a factor 1
over 80 that comes in

559
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,150 
and that and generates are out

560
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,440 
and so this in fact and

561
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,579 
represents a block diagram which is a
general block diagram for implementing

562
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:23,099 
war representing near constant
coefficient difference

563
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,069 
wage

564
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:29,420 
now if you think about what it means in
terms of what's a computer algorithm or

565
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,589 
a piece of hardware

566
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:34,690 
in fact this block diagram is a recipe
or algorithm for doing the

567
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,680 
implementation

568
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,500 
by it's important to

569
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,040 
recognize even at this point dad it's
only one

570
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,520 
many possible algorithms or
implementations for this difference

571
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000 
wage

572
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,369 
just for example

573
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:57,080 
I can consider that equation

574
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,350 
core that block diagram

575
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,060 
and here I've redrawn at so

576
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,170 
here once again I have the same block
diagram that we just saw

577
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,740 
and I can recognize for example

578
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,360 
that this in essence corresponds to

579
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,570 
to linear time-invariant systems

580
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,210 
in cascade

581
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,420 
now that assumes of course that my

582
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,550 
initial conditions are such dad I that
the system is in fact

583
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,210 
when you're and that in turn requires
that we're assuming initial rest namely

584
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,080 
before the input does anything

585
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,690 
other than 0 there are just zero value
stored in the registers

586
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,220 
but assuming that it corresponds to a
linear time-invariant system

587
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,220 
this is a cascade to linear
time-invariant systems

588
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,850 
we know that two linear time-invariant
systems can be cascaded

589
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,490 
in either order so in particular I can
consider

590
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,320 
breaking this cascade here and moving
this block

591
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,890 
over to the other side and so let's just

592
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,660 
do that

593
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,040 
and when I do

594
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,109 
I then have

595
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:16,200 
this combination systems

596
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,210 
and of course you can ask what advantage
there is to do in at

597
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,750 
and the advantage arises because it the
fact

598
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,540 
there'd in this form

599
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,570 
exactly what is stored in these delays

600
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,780 
is also stored in the still air
registers

601
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,290 
in other words it's this intermediate
variable

602
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,640 
whatever it is down this chain of delays
and down this chain of the ladies

603
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,580 
and so in fact I can collapse those
delays

604
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,650 
into a single chain of delays and

605
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,980 
the network that I'm left with is the
network that I indicate

606
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,260 
I missed you graph where what I've done
is to simply collapse that

607
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,380 
double chain of the ladies into a single
chain

608
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,620 
the waves

609
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,700 
now want to ask well what's the
advantage to doing that and the

610
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,490 
advantage

611
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,290 
one advantage simply stated is that when
you think in terms of an implementation

612
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,550 
of a difference equation

613
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,680 
the lady corresponds to

614
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,220 
storage register a memory location and
by this

615
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,050 
by simply using the fact that we can
interchange the order in which linear

616
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,180 
time-invariant systems are cascaded

617
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,440 
we can reduce the amount of memory by a
factor to

618
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,330 
okay now

619
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:40,440 
and essentially similar procedure can
also be used for

620
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,540 
differential equations in terms of
implementation

621
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,660 
using block diagrams for the
interpretation implementations

622
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,270 
using like diagrams and let me first do
that

623
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,420 
rather than in general let me first do
it in the in

624
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,920 
the context love a specific example

625
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,640 
so

626
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,250 
let's consider a when your constant
coefficient differential equation as

627
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,490 
i've indicated here

628
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,320 
and I have terms on the left side in
terms on the right side

629
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,410 
and with the differential equation

630
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,530 
let's consider taking overturns

631
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,789 
over to the right side of the equation
except

632
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:29,650 
for the highest the residue in the
output next we

633
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,809 
integrate both sides of the equation are
so that

634
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,359 
when we're done we end up with the on
the left side of the equation

635
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,119 
with y ft on the right side of the
equation with the appropriate number

636
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,829 
%uh integrations and so the InterPro
equation

637
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:49,970 
that will get is for this example y ft
the output is except the

638
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,510 
plus be the scale factor times the
integral

639
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:57,950 
the input and -8 at scale factor times
the integral

640
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,970 
the output so to

641
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,420 
form the output in a block diagram turns

642
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,490 
we form a linear combination of the
input

643
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,020 
scaled in to grow the input and a scale

644
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,119 
integral love the output all of that and
it together

645
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,710 
so we need in addition to

646
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,299 
the input we need the integral

647
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,619 
love the input and so this box indicates
an integrator

648
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,029 
in addition to the output we need

649
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,390 
the integral the output and now

650
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,950 
to for why ft we

651
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,029 
multiply the integrated in play

652
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:42,359 
by the scale factor B and

653
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,800 
and back to exit C

654
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,750 
and retake the integrated output
multiplied by Minas de

655
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,280 
and and to that

656
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,600 
the result are the previous addition

657
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,940 
and according to the integral equation
then that forms

658
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,220 
the output

659
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,530 
so just as we did with the difference
equation

660
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,880 
we've converted the differential
equation to

661
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,240 
an integral equation and we have a block
diagram for very similar

662
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,740 
to what we had in the case the
difference equation now the initial

663
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,050 
conditions of course

664
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,960 
are tied up and again how these
integrators

665
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,630 
are initialized assuming that we impose
initial rest on the system

666
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,110 
weekend thinkers the overall system is a
linear time-invariant system

667
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,670 
and it's a cascade one linear
time-invariant system with the second

668
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,070 
so we can in fact

669
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,650 
break this

670
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,120 
and consider interchanging the order in
which these two systems a cascade

671
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,110 
and so i've indicated that down below
here

672
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,670 
I've simply taken the top block diagram

673
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,490 
interchange the order in which the to

674
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,160 
systems are cascaded and

675
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,540 
here again we can ask what the
advantages to this

676
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,310 
as opposed to the previous one and what
you can see

677
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,620 
just as we saw with the difference
equation is that

678
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,830 
now the integrators both integrators

679
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,870 
are integrating the same thing in
particular

680
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,140 
the input to this integrator and the
input

681
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,420 
to this integrator are identical so in
fact

682
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,120 
rather than using this one we can simply
tap of

683
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,670 
from here we can in fact remove this
integrator

684
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,540 
break this connection

685
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,490 
and happy and at this point and so

686
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,710 
what we've done and by interchange in
the order in which the systems are

687
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,710 
cascaded

688
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,110 
is reduced the implementation to the
implementation

689
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,620 
with a single integrated very much
similar to

690
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,950 
what we talked about in the case the
difference wage

691
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,400 
now let's just again with the integral
equation

692
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,320 
way the differential equation looked at

693
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,850 
this somewhat more generally again

694
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:18,930 
if we take the differential equation the
general differential equation

695
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,330 
integrated a sufficient number of times
to convert it to an integral equation

696
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,570 
we would then have this cascaded systems

697
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:32,160 
and again if we assume initial rest

698
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,270 
so that these are both linear
time-invariant systems

699
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,330 
we can interchange the order in which
they are cascaded

700
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,310 
namely take the second system and

701
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,809 
move it

702
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:48,260 
to proceed the first system

703
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,980 
and then we recognize is that the input
to this change

704
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,359 
integrators and this change integrators
is exactly the same

705
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:59,880 
and so in fact we can collapse these
together

706
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,680 
using only one change integrators and
the system

707
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,410 
there we're left with then is system

708
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,710 
that looks as i've indicated here so we
have

709
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,420 
now just a single chain integrators

710
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,490 
is that a the two sets in

711
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,060 
so we've seen that the situation is very
similar here as it was in the case the

712
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,230 
difference equation

713
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,150 
again why do we want to cut the number
integrators in half

714
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:33,540 
well one reason is because integrators
in effect represent hardware

715
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,710 
and if we use half as much if we have
half as many integrators

716
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,790 
then using half as much hard

717
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,690 
okay well let me just conclude by
summarizing

718
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,250 
a number of points I indicated at the
beginning

719
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,230 
that linear constant coefficient
differential equations a difference

720
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,120 
equations

721
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,770 
will play an important role as linear
time-invariant systems

722
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,060 
throughout this coursing throughout the
center lectures

723
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,110 
I also stress

724
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,360 
the fact that differential or difference
equations

725
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,250 
by themselves are not a complete
specification

726
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,920 
the system because of the fact that we
can and

727
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,150 
to any solution a homogeneous

728
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,600 
I do we specify the appropriate initial
conditions

729
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,640 
to ensure how do we specify the
appropriate initial conditions to ensure

730
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,970 
that the system

731
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,000 
is linear and time-invariant well

732
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,670 
the auxiliary information namely the
initial conditions

733
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,690 
dissociated with the system

734
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,040 
be causal linear and time-invariant

735
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,050 
are the conditions of initial rest

736
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,280 
and in fact for most of the cores

737
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,370 
what will be interested in systems that
are in fact cause a linear and

738
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,330 
time-invariant

739
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:03,810 
and so we will in fact be assuming
initial rest conditions

740
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,050 
now

741
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,070 
as I also indicated their are

742
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,490 
a variety of efficient procedures for
solving differential

743
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,900 
and difference equations that we haven't
yet address and

744
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,359 
beginning with the next set of lectures
will be talking about

745
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:23,440 
for EA transform and much later in the
course

746
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,710 
what's referred to as the apostrophe its
form for continuous-time

747
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:31,319 
and sea transport for discrete-time and
what we'll see

748
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,380 
is that with the Fourier transform in
later with the apostasy transform

749
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,670 
will have a number love efficient and
very useful ways

750
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,970 
%uh generating the solution for

751
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:48,930 
differential and difference equations
this under the assumption that the

752
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,279 
system is causal

753
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:52,660 
when you're in time very

754
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,320 
also will see in addition to the block
diagram implementations

755
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,490 
the systems that we talked about so far

756
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,320 
we'll see another a number of other
useful

757
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,040 
implementations that exploit a variety
of properties associated with

758
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,300 
Korean past thank you
