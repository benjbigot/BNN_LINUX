005790~007000~ha the the
027410~007000~the more
035719~007000~the last time
043409~003211~we talked about the you the representation
046620~004289~%uh linear time-invariant systems through the convolution song
050909~002761~in the discrete-time case and the convolution integral in the
053670~000909~continuous-time
054579~004980~case now although the derivation was relatively straightforward
059559~003590~in fact the result is really kind of amazing because
063149~004830~what it tells us is that for linear time-invariant systems
067979~004060~if we know the response to the system to a single in polls
072039~003321~at equal 0 or in fact that any other time
075360~004230~then we can determine from that its response
079590~006180~to an arbitrary input through the use of convolution furthermore
085770~003580~what we'll see as the course develops is that in fact
089350~003590~the class a linear time-invariant systems is a very rich class
092940~003599~there are lots of systems that have that property
096539~004310~and in addition there are lots a very interesting things that you can do with
100849~001770~linear time-invariant systems
102619~003691~in today's lecture
106310~003240~what I'd like to begin with is focusing
109550~003730~on convolution as an algebraic operation
113280~005149~and will see that it has a number of algebraic properties then in turn
118429~003420~have important implications for
121849~003160~linear time-invariant systems then we'll turn
125009~003021~to a discussion or what the
128030~003270~characterization %uh linear time-invariant systems
131300~003130~through convolution implies
134430~004520~in terms of the relationship various other system properties
138950~003670~to the impulse response let me begin by
142620~003630~reminding you love the basic result that we
146250~003959~develop last time which is the convolution some
150209~003021~in discrete-time as
153230~003440~I indicate here and
156670~003120~the convolution integral in continuous-time
159790~005910~in and what the convolution some more the convolution integral tells us
165700~003150~is how to relate the output
168850~004650~to the input and to the system impulse response
173500~003510~and the expression looks
177010~003650~basically the same in continuous-time and discrete-time
180660~005140~and I remind you also that we talked about a graphical interpretation
185800~004150~where essentially to graphically
189950~003410~interpret convolution required for
193360~003030~was developed in terms
196390~003450~or taking the system impulse response
199840~003180~flipping it sliding it past the input
203020~003620~and with positioned appropriately depending on the
206640~003830~value of the independent variable for which were computing
210470~003290~the convolution and then multiplying and
213760~003270~summing in the discrete-time case or integrating
217030~004810~in the continuous-time case now
221840~004060~convolution as an algebraic operation
225900~003440~has a number or important properties
229340~004009~one of the properties of convolution
233349~003851~is that it is what is referred to as commuted
237200~003920~community here means that
241120~003190~we can think either a convo loving
244310~003899~X with age or H with axe
248209~003291~and the order in which that's done
251500~004549~doesn't affect the output result so summarized here
256049~003470~is what the community operation is
259519~003811~in discrete-time or in continuous-time
263330~003399~and it says as I just indicated that
266729~003220~x7 convolved with a chip and
269949~003351~is equal to a chip and convolved
273300~003220~with exit or the same course
276520~003660~in continuous-time and in fact
280180~003489~in the lecture last time
283669~005061~we worked an example where we had indiscreet I'm an impulse response which
288730~001830~was an exponential
290560~004230~and an input which is a unit step
294790~003680~and in the text what you'll find is
298470~003240~the same example work except in that case
301710~005700~the input is the exponential and the system impulse response is the step
307410~003250~and that corresponds to the example in the text
310660~005090~which is example 3.1
315750~004050~and what happens in an example is that in fact
319800~003080~what you'll see is that the same result
322880~003430~occurs an example 3.1 as we generated
326310~003250~in the lecture and there's a similar comparison
329560~004120~in continuous-time this example was worked in
333680~003150~lecture and this example
336830~003440~is work in the text in other words
340270~003110~the text works the example where the system
343380~003349~impulse response is
346729~005401~unit step and the input is an exponential
352130~003130~right now the community property as I said tells us
355260~003330~that the order in which we do convolution
358590~003150~doesn't affect the result to the convolution
361740~003230~the same is true for continuous-time and discrete-time
364970~004509~and in fact for the other algebraic properties that I'll talk about
369479~005601~the results are exactly the same for continuous-time and discrete-time
375080~003180~so in fact what we can do is
378260~005490~drop the independent variable as an argument
383750~006100~so that we suppress any kinda difference between continuous and discrete-time
389850~004069~and suppressing be independent variable
393919~004051~within state the community property as I've
397970~003150~rewritten it here just X convulsed with age because
401120~003420~H involved with the ex the same in continuous-time
404540~004599~and discrete-time now
409139~003620~the derivation to the community property is
412759~004401~more less amount you bro which you can follow through in the book it involves
417160~003860~soem changes variables and
421020~003320~in some things that sort
424340~003310~what I'd like to focus on with that and other properties
427650~004090~is not the derivation which you can see in the tax
431740~003050~by rather the interpretation
434790~004060~so we have the community property and now there are two other
438850~003580~important algebraic properties one being
442430~003690~what is referred to as the associative property
446120~005380~which tells us that if we have X convulsed with
451500~003520~the result ok involving h1 with h2
455020~004269~that's exactly the same as X convolved with h1
459289~003630~and that result involved with h2
462919~003601~and what this permits is
466520~005019~for us to write for example ex-convict alt with h1
471539~004961~involved with h2 without any ambiguity
476500~003710~because it doesn't matter from the associative property
480210~004290~how we grew the terms together
484500~004789~the third important property is what is referred to as the distributive property
489289~004261~namely the fact the convolution distributes over addition
493550~003390~and what I mean by that is what i've indicated
496940~003069~here on the slide dead if
500009~003981~I think or X convo with the psalm
503990~003739~of h1n h2 that's identical
507729~003660~to first involving X with h1
511389~003200~also can bombing X with h2 and then
514589~003610~adding the two together and that result
518199~004601~will be the same as this result
522800~003269~so convolution is community
526069~003051~associative and it distributes over addition
529120~003409~three very important algebraic properties and
532529~004891~by the way there are other algebraic operations that have
537420~003680~that same property for example multiplication
541100~003380~numbers is likewise commuted to associative
544480~003200~and distributed now
547680~003560~let's look at what these three properties
551240~003960~imply a specifically for linear time-invariant systems
555200~003440~and as we'll see the the implications
558640~003650~are both very interesting and very important
562290~004650~let's begin with the community property
566940~003530~and consider in particular
570470~004179~a system with an impulse response age
574649~004821~and I represent that by simply writing the H inside the box
579470~003150~an input tax and an output then
582620~003510~which is X convulsed with age
586130~003070~now since this operation is commuted to
589200~003860~I can right is that affects convolved with a I can write
593060~003890~H convolved with ex and that would correspond
596950~003300~to a system with impulse response
600250~003899~X and input H and output then
604149~003761~age involved with ex
607910~003549~so the community property
611459~005161~tells us therefore a linear time-invariant system
616620~003560~the system output is independent
620180~003190~all which function we call the input
623370~004110~and which function we call the impulse response kind amazing actually
627480~003640~we can interchange the role input and impulse response
631120~004040~and from input or permit output point of view
635160~003510~the output for the system doesn't care
638670~004940~now furthermore if we combine the community property
643610~004530~with the associative property we get another very interesting result
648140~005730~namely that if we have two linear time-invariant systems in cascade
653870~005060~the overall system is independent of the order in which they are cascaded
658930~003310~and in fact in either case the Cascade can be
662240~003450~collapsed into a single system
665690~005399~to see this let's first consider
671089~004661~the Cascade or two systems one with impulse response h1
675750~003769~the other with impulse response h2 and
679519~003121~the outputted the first system is then
682640~003170~X convulsed with h1
685810~003690~and then that is the input to the second system
689500~003760~and so the output a bad is that result
693260~003690~convolved with h2
696950~003579~so this is the result of cascading the two
700529~004521~and now we can use the associative property
705050~004250~to rewrite this and as
709300~003560~X involved with h1
712860~005330~involved with h2 where we grew these two terms together
718190~003450~and so using the associative property
721640~003900~we now can collapse that into a single system
725540~005850~with an input which is ax an impulse response which is h1 convolved with h2
731390~003080~and the output is then ex-convict all with
734470~003410~the result that those two can borrow
737880~003050~next we can apply the community property
740930~003500~and the commuter property says we could write
744430~004540~this impulse response that way or we can write it this way
748970~004540~and since convolutions community the resulting output will be exactly the
753510~000620~same
754130~005100~and so these resulting output will be exactly the same
759230~005190~and now once again we can use the associative property
764420~004280~to group these two terms together
768700~003870~and X convulsed with h2
772570~003829~corresponds to putting X first through the system h2
776399~003601~and then an output through the system h1 and so
780000~004730~finally applying the associative property again as I just outlined
784730~003430~we can expand that system back into
788160~004200~two systems in cascade with h2 first
792360~005260~NH one second
797620~004899~okay well that involves a certain amount love algebraic manipulation
802519~003891~and that it's not the algebraic manipulation that's important is the
806410~001869~result that it's important
808279~003081~and what the result says to reiterate this if I have to
811360~003380~linear time-invariant systems in cascade
814740~005020~I can cascade them in any order and the result is the same
819760~006350~now you might think well G maybe that actually applies the systems in general
826110~004010~whether you put them this way or that way but in fact as we talked about last
830120~001089~time
831209~003341~and I illustrated with an example
834550~003539~in general if the system is not linear
838089~003231~the systems are not linear and time-invariant then
841320~004139~the order in which they are cascaded is important to the interpretation of the
845459~001261~overall system
846720~004130~for example one system took the square root
850850~004140~any other system double the input
854990~003039~taking the square root and then doubling
858029~004131~gives us a different answer doubling first and then taking the square root
862160~004049~and of course one can construct much more elaborate example
866209~005521~net so it's a property very particular to linear time-invariant systems and
871730~000940~also
872670~007000~one that we will exploit many many times as we go through this material
880920~003099~the final property related to
884019~003870~interconnection systems that I want to just indicate
887889~003411~develops ida the distributive property
891300~003580~and what it applies to is an interpretation
894880~004160~%uh the interconnection of systems in parallel
899040~003200~recall there the parallel combination
902240~003960~systems corresponds is a indicate here
906200~005980~to a system in which we simultaneously feed the input into
912180~004520~h1 nh2 these representing the impulse responses
916700~003500~and then the outputs our song and to form
920200~003720~the overall output and
923920~003800~using the fact their convolution distributes
927720~003049~over addition we can rewrite yes
930769~003611~as X involved with h1
934380~003399~plus h2
937779~003860~and when we do that then we can recognize this
941639~003811~as the output the system with input acts
945450~004879~and impulse response which is the sum of these two impulse responses
950329~004320~so for linear time-invariant systems in parallel
954649~003281~we can if we choose
957930~003700~replace that interconnection by a single system
961630~003009~whose impulse response is simply some
964639~005411~those impulse response
970050~003599~okay now we have this very
973649~004461~powerful representation for linear time-invariant systems
978110~004960~terms 0 convolution and we've seen so far in this lecture
983070~004920~how convolution and the representation through the impulse response
987990~006120~leads to some but important implications for system interconnections
994110~005000~what I like to turn to now are other system properties
999110~006560~and see how for linear time-invariant systems in particular
1005670~003840~other system properties can be Associated
1009510~003100~with particular properties or characteristics
1012610~004050~love the system impulse response and what will talk about
1016660~004260~are a variety of properties will talk about the issue memory will talk about
1020920~000669~the issue
1021589~003220~portability and will talk about the issue
1024809~005431~causality and also stability
1030240~003929~well let's begin with the issue of memory and the question
1034169~004130~now is what are the implications
1038299~004571~for the system impulse response for a linear time-invariant system remember
1042870~002589~that we're always imposing that on the system
1045459~003871~what are the implications on the impulse response if the system
1049330~003050~does or does not have memory
1052380~004090~well we can answer that by looking at
1056470~003419~the convolution property
1059889~006821~and we have here as a reminder the convolution integral
1066710~003610~which tells us how accept an hour in a chip T-minus
1070320~005729~now are combined to give us y'at
1076049~003320~and what I've illustrated above is
1079369~003380~only general kind of example
1082749~003110~here is except al here is
1085859~003630~a chip T-minus now an
1089489~003361~to compute the output at any time T
1092850~003590~we would take these two multiply them together
1096440~006339~and integrate from minus infinity the plus infinity
1102779~003100~so the question then is what can we say about
1105879~003130~H T the impulse response
1109009~003331~in order to guarantee let's say
1112340~004769~that the output depends only on the input at time t
1117109~003160~well its pretty much obvious from looking
1120269~003660~at the grabs
1123929~003380~if we only want the output to depend
1127309~004460~on XO how at Tower equals T
1131769~003051~then a chip T-minus have 0 better
1134820~004569~be non-zero only at Tower equals T
1139389~003670~and so the implication is that
1143059~003690~for the system to be memory less
1146749~003870~what we require is that HFT -10 now
1150619~003400~be 90 only at outcalls
1154019~003290~T so
1157309~004950~we want the impulse response to be 90 and only one point
1162259~004260~we wanted to contribute something after we multiply and go through an integral
1166519~003441~an effect with that says is the only thing they can be
1169960~003480~and meet all those conditions is a scale dimples
1173440~004789~so if the system is to be memoryless
1178229~004810~then that requires that the impulse response you scale them poles
1183039~003010~any other impulse response
1186049~003200~then in essence requires
1189249~004990~that the system has memory or implies that the system member
1194239~004351~so for the continuous-time case then
1198590~005189~memoryless would correspond only to the impulse response being proportional to
1203779~003610~an impulse and in the discrete-time case
1207389~003071~a similar statement in which case
1210460~003349~the output is just proportional
1213809~003310~to the input again either in the continuous-time
1217119~005321~war in the discrete-time case
1222440~004239~right now we can turn our attention to the issue
1226679~003950~love system inverter ability and
1230629~003470~room recall that what is meant by
1234099~003630~inverted bility of a system or the inverse of a system
1237729~004070~the inverse nervous system is a system which one week cascaded
1241799~004490~with the one that were requiring about the overall cascade
1246289~003070~is the identity system in other words
1249359~004060~the output is equal to the in
1253419~003110~so let's consider a system with
1256529~003941~impulse response age input is ax
1260470~004459~and let's say that the impulse response that the inverse system is a
1264929~003041~by and the output is why
1267970~003350~then the output of this system is
1271320~005559~X convolved with age convolved with a stir by
1276879~003180~and we want this to
1280059~004360~come out equal X and what that requires then
1284419~004120~is that this convolution
1288539~003440~just simply be equal to an impulse
1291979~003150~either in the discrete-time case
1295129~003170~or in the continuous-time
1298299~003320~and under those conditions then HD by
1301619~003030~is equal to the University
1304649~004100~rotationally by the way its of inconvenient
1308749~003660~to right instead of eight supply as the impulse response
1312409~004811~the embers will find it convenient of any more typical
1317220~004299~to write as the in burners instead of age to buy
1321519~004010~age to the -1
1325529~003140~and we mean by that the inverse
1328669~005000~impulse response and one has to be careful not to misinterpret this
1333669~003051~as the reciprocal have a chip to your YouTube and
1336720~007000~which meant in this notation is the inverse system
1344249~003860~now if age to buy
1348109~005841~is the inverse of age is H the inverse have a supply
1353950~004409~well it seems like that or be plausible or
1358359~003060~perhaps make sense the question if
1361419~003490~you believe that the answer is yes is howdy how in fact
1364909~003320~you verified that and
1368229~003841~I'll leave that to you think about it the answer is yes that
1372070~004089~if a surprise the inverse of age than H is the inverse a pizza by
1376159~004051~and the key to showing that is to exploit the fact
1380210~003639~that when we take the systems and Cascade them we can cascade
1383849~004060~them in your order
1387909~004031~all right now let's turn to another system property
1391940~003650~the property love stability and again
1395590~003639~we can't I that property directly
1399229~003130~to issues related
1402359~004660~in particular to the system impulse response
1407019~004360~now stability is defined as we've chosen to define it as I
1411379~005250~I by the previously as bounded input bounded out but stability in other words
1416629~001550~for every bounded input
1418179~003740~is a bounded out what you can show
1421919~003590~and I won't go through the algebra here it's
1425509~004081~going through in the book is the
1429590~003480~a necessary and sufficient condition for
1433070~003880~a linear time-invariant system to be stable
1436950~003199~it in the bounded input bounded output sense
1440149~003140~is that the
1443289~003590~impulse response be what is referred to as
1446879~005050~absolutely so mobile in other words if you take the absolute values
1451929~004401~and some over infinite limits that's fine I
1456330~003139~or in the continuous-time
1459469~004090~case that the impulse response is absolutely integral
1463559~003920~in other words if you take the absolute bad news have a chip T
1467479~003950~integrate that's fine I'd and under those conditions
1471429~003450~the system is stable if
1474879~003201~those conditions are violated then
1478080~003439~for sure as you'll see in the text the system
1481519~003100~is on stable so stability can also
1484619~005870~be tied to the system impulse response
1490489~003140~now the next property that I wanna talk about
1493629~003061~is the property of causality
1496690~003039~and before I do what I'd like to do
1499729~004140~is introduce peripheral result that will then
1503869~003020~use when we talk about causality
1506889~003710~namely what's referred to as the zero input response
1510599~004241~when your system
1514840~004230~the basic result which is a very interesting and useful one
1519070~003239~is that for a linear system and in fact
1522309~004320~it's whether it's time invariant or not this applies
1526629~005040~if you put nothing into it you get nothing out
1531669~003021~so if we have an input
1534690~005079~accept T which is zero for all T
1539769~003561~and if the output that system
1543330~003679~is y'at
1547009~003181~if the input is zero for all time
1550190~004289~then the output likewise is 0 for all time
1554479~003060~that's true for continuous-time and
1557539~007000~it's also true for discrete-time
1564779~003030~and in fact to show that result
1567809~006940~is pretty much straightforward we could do it either by using convolution which
1574749~004071~would of course be associated with many a ready in time invariance
1578820~004020~but in fact we can show their property relatively easily
1582840~004199~by simply using the fact that for a linear system
1587039~003230~what we know is that if
1590269~004061~we have an input exit T
1594330~003079~with an output y'at
1597409~003210~then if we scale the input
1600619~003360~then the output scales accordingly
1603979~003040~well we can simply shoes
1607019~004301~as the scale factor eight equal 0
1611320~003649~and if we do that it says put nothing in
1614969~003351~you get nothing out and
1618320~003979~what will see is that that has some important implications
1622299~003151~interns love causality
1625450~003959~it's important though wall or on it to stress that
1629409~003320~not every system obviously has that property did nothing
1632729~003370~you get nothing out a simple example
1636099~003310~is let's say a battery
1639409~004640~let's say not connected to anything the output is six bolts no matter what the
1644049~001230~input is
1645279~003640~and it of course then doesn't have this
1648919~003651~0 response to zero input very particular
1652570~003500~the linear systems or I will now
1656070~005000~let's see what this means for causality
1661070~003199~to remind you causality says in effect
1664269~003640~that the system can't anticipate the input that's what
1667909~003730~basically causality means when we
1671639~004051~talked about it previously we defined it in a variety of ways
1675690~003000~one of which was the statement that
1678690~004809~if two inputs are identical up until sometime
1683499~004660~than the outputs must be identical up until the same time
1688159~003520~the reason kinda to Italy is that
1691679~003680~if the system is causal so it can anticipate the future
1695359~003660~can anticipate whether these two identical imports are
1699019~003130~sometime later going to change from each other
1702149~003561~or not
1705710~004319~so causality in general is simply this statement
1710029~004030~either continuous-time and discrete-time
1714059~003180~and now let's look at what that means
1717239~003910~for a linear system for a linear system
1721149~004600~what that corresponds to or can be translated to
1725749~003380~is a statement it says that
1729129~004780~if x50 is 0 party less than $30,000
1733909~003541~then y'at is the must be zero
1737450~003169~party less than $30,000 also
1740619~004050~and so what that in effect
1744669~003140~says is that the system
1747809~004511~for a linear system to be causal
1752320~003589~in mice have the property sometimes referred to
1755909~003171~as initial rest meaning
1759080~004799~it doesn't respond until there's some input that happen
1763879~003610~that it initially at rest until the input becomes
1767489~004120~90 now why is this true why
1771609~003990~is this a consequence of causality for
1775599~003870~Lee year systems well the reason is
1779469~004190~we know that if we put nothing in we get nothing out
1783659~004171~if we have an input that 0 perty less than t0
1787830~005370~and the system can't anticipate whether that input is going to change from zero
1793200~004539~or not then yes it must also the system must generate
1797739~004951~and output that 0 up until that time
1802690~004119~following the principle that if two inputs are identical up until sometime
1806809~003891~the outputs must be identical up same time
1810700~003979~so this basic result
1814679~004080~for when here systems is essentially
1818759~003260~a consequence all the statement there
1822019~003860~for a linear system 0n
1825879~007000~gives us 0 out
1833509~003750~now bad tells us
1837259~004410~how to interpret or hi I don't tupac was ality
1841669~004720~for linear systems now let's proceed to linear time-invariant systems
1846389~004530~and in fact we can carry the point one step further
1850919~004340~in particular necessary and sufficient condition
1855259~004610~for causality in the case linear time-invariant systems
1859869~003630~is there the impulse response
1863499~004451~be 0 party less than zero
1867950~003500~in the continuous-time case or
1871450~003219~for and less than zero in the discrete-time case
1874669~003850~so for linear time-invariant systems causality
1878519~003610~is equivalent to the impulse response
1882129~004980~being 0 up until to your and equal to 0
1887109~004581~now to show this it essentially follows
1891690~003679~by first considering
1895369~003030~why causality
1898399~004340~would imply that this is true
1902739~003940~and that follows because if the straightforward fact
1906679~006960~that the impulse itself is 0 perty less than zero
1913639~003681~and what we saw is there before is that
1917320~004079~for any linear system causality requires that if the input is your office or
1921399~000900~sometime
1922299~003910~the output must be zero up until the same time
1926209~003070~and so thats showing
1929279~003820~the result in one direction to show the result
1933099~004020~in the other direction namely to show you that
1937119~003060~yeah in fact the impulse response
1940179~003710~satisfied that condition then the system is causal
1943889~003051~while I won't work through it in detail
1946940~003909~it essentially boils down to recognizing
1950849~004880~that in the convolutions some
1955729~004270~or in the convolution integral
1959999~005120~if in fact that condition is satisfied on the impulse response
1965119~003800~then the upper limit on the song the discrete-time
1968919~003290~case changes an and in the continuous-time
1972209~003760~case changes to see and that in effect
1975969~003190~says that bad news or
1979159~003870~the input only from minus unity up the time n
1983029~004810~are used in computing y van and a similar kind of result
1987839~003470~for the continuous-time case why
1991309~003720~T
1995029~004560~okay so we've seen how the impulse response
1999589~003611~or rather how certain system properties in the linear time-invariant
2003200~003309~case can be converted into
2006509~004321~various requirements on the imports responsible when your time
2010830~004649~very insist on the impulse response being complete characterization
2015479~003200~let's looked at some particular examples just
2018679~003490~to and a cement the ideas further
2022169~004760~and let's begin with a system that you've seen previously which is
2026929~003820~accumulator accumulator as you recall
2030749~003220~has an output why I have an
2033969~004020~which is the accumulated value
2037989~005100~up the input from minus infinity up to n
2043089~003491~now you've seen in the impose in in
2046580~003660~a previous lecture or rather in the video course manual for previous
2050240~005220~lecture that an accumulator is a linear time-invariant system
2055460~004290~and in fact it's impossible sponsor is the accumulated
2059750~003879~bad news opinion polls namely the impulse response
2063629~004061~is equal to a step
2067690~004010~so what we want to answer is
2071700~003360~what knowing what that impulse responses what
2075060~003250~some properties are the accumulator
2078310~003119~and let's first ask about memory
2081429~004170~well we recognize that the impulse response
2085599~003270~is not simply an impulse in fact it's a step
2088869~003170~and so this implies what well
2092039~003120~it implies that the system has
2095159~004930~memory
2100089~003161~second the impulse response
2103250~003559~is zero more and less than zero
2106809~003941~that implies that the system is
2110750~004470~causal
2115220~003379~and finally if we look at
2118599~005700~the some the absolute values at the impulse response from minus infinity
2124299~001691~plus infinity
2125990~004500~this is a step we accumulate those values over infinite limits
2130490~004750~then at in fact comes out to be infinite
2135240~004010~and so what that implies then is that
2139250~003210~the accumulator is not stable in
2142460~005790~the bounded input found that out what sets
2148250~003930~now I want to turn to some other systems but while we're on the accumulator I
2152180~002119~just want to draw your attention to the fact
2154299~004320~which will kinda come up in a variety of ways again later
2158619~006091~that we can rewrite the equation for an accumulator the difference equation
2164710~003180~by recognizing that we could in fact
2167890~004040~write the output as the accumulated values
2171930~005230~up the time n -1 and then and on the last value
2177160~004379~and in fact if we do that this corresponds to why
2181539~003121~van -1 and so
2184660~003699~we could rewrite this difference equation as why I have an
2188359~003021~is why event -1 a sexy
2191380~003550~so the output is the previously computed output
2194930~003230~plus the input expressed that way
2198160~004040~what that corresponds to is what is
2202200~004550~collar workers a difference equation and difference equations will be a topic
2206750~004559~I'll considerable emphasis in the next lecture
2211309~003081~now does an accumulator have an inverse well
2214390~003949~the answer is in fact yes and let's look at what
2218339~003881~the inverse that the accumulator is
2222220~004099~the impulse response the accumulator is a step
2226319~003450~to inquire about its inverse in we inquire
2229769~004570~about whether there's a system which one we cascade
2234339~004930~the accumulator with that system which i'm calling its in burrs
2239269~003131~we get an impulse out
2242400~003580~well let's see the impulse response
2245980~003900~the accumulators staff we want to put the step into something
2249880~003699~and get out in polls and in fact
2253579~003020~what you recall from the
2256599~003351~lecture in which we introduce steps and impulses
2259950~004720~the impulse is in fact the first difference of the units that
2264670~003159~so we have a difference equation
2267829~003881~that describes 4s how the impulse
2271710~003780~is related to the step and so
2275490~003950~if this system does this the output will be
2279440~003560~that an impulse and so if we think
2283000~003829~or x2 a van
2286829~004020~and as the input and y2 event is the output
2290849~003430~then difference equation for
2294279~004090~the inverse system is what i've indicated here
2298369~003111~and if we want to look at the impulse response to that
2301480~005430~we can then inquire as to what the responses with an impulse in
2306910~003800~and white develops in a straightforward way
2310710~003790~and is Delta van which is are important point
2314500~003109~minus Delta again -1
2317609~003091~is equal to the impulse response
2320700~003210~in burrs system so alright that
2323910~003510~as age in person
2327420~003510~now we have been that the accumulator
2330930~003540~as it infers and this is the embers
2334470~005010~and you can examine issues a memory stability causality et cetera
2339480~005099~what you find is that the system has memory
2344579~003040~the University later it's stable
2347619~003631~and its causal and it's interesting to note by the way
2351250~004599~that although the accumulator with an unstable system
2355849~004111~the embers are the king later is a stable system
2359960~003809~in general if a system is stable its inverse
2363769~003201~does not have to be stable or vice versa
2366970~005250~and the same thing with causality
2372220~004200~okay now there are
2376420~003820~a number of other examples which course we could discuss
2380240~004819~and let me just quickly point to
2385059~003891~in one example which is a difference equation as i've indicated
2388950~005389~here and as will talk about it more detail
2394339~003720~in our next lecture will will
2398059~003321~get involved in a fairly detailed discussion linear cut coefficient
2401380~000830~difference
2402210~004109~and differential equations this falls into that category
2406319~003191~and under the imposition
2409510~003450~what's referred to as initial rest
2412960~004409~which corresponds to response being 0
2417369~003391~up until the time that the input becomes non-zero
2420760~003019~the impulse response is a to the N
2423779~003421~times you have an and something that
2427200~004020~you'll be asked to think about in the video course manual
2431220~003500~is whether that system has memory whether its causal
2434720~003530~and whether it's stable and likewise
2438250~003480~for a linear constant coefficient
2441730~003410~differential equation the specific one
2445140~003290~that I've indicated here under
2448430~003189~the assumption of initial rest the impulse response
2451619~003121~is into the minus two tee times you the
2454740~003700~and in the video course manual again you'll be asked
2458440~003119~to examined whether the system has memory
2461559~004851~whether its causal and whether it's stable
2466410~003649~okay well as i've indicated in the next lecture will
2470059~004450~return to much more detailed discussion when your constant coefficient
2474509~001151~differential and difference
2475660~004399~equations now what I'd like to finally
2480059~005540~doing this lecture is use the notion of convolution in a much different way
2485599~004470~to help us with a problem that I alluded to earlier
2490069~004161~in particular the issue love how to deal with some other mathematical
2494230~002240~difficulties associated
2496470~003160~with impulses and steps
2499630~003350~now let me begin by illustrating
2502980~003910~kinda what the problem is and the
2506890~003830~an example of the kinda paradox that sore right to
2510720~003200~when dealing with impose functions and step
2513920~003099~options
2517019~003401~let's consider first the ball a system
2520420~004330~which is the identity system and so the output is
2524750~003509~course equal to the input and
2528259~006590~again we can talk about that either in continuous-time and discrete-time
2534849~003361~well we know that the function that you
2538210~004089~convolved with a signal to retain a signal
2542299~003760~is an impulse and so that means that the impulse response
2546059~006210~love and identity system is an impulse makes logical sense
2552269~005181~furthermore if I take to identity systems and Cascade them
2557450~004020~I put in an input get the same thing and the first system that goes into the
2561470~002829~second system get the same thing at the second
2564299~003581~in other words if I have to
2567880~003689~identity systems in cascade
2571569~004280~the cascade likewise is an identity system
2575849~003220~in other words this overall system is
2579069~004250~also and identity system
2583319~004141~and the implication there is that the impulse response
2587460~004319~up this is an impulse the impulse response if this is an impulse
2591779~004820~and the convolution of those two is also an impulse
2596599~004740~so for continuous time we require than that
2601339~003240~interpose convolved with itself was an impulse
2604579~004280~and the same thing for discrete-time
2608859~003010~now in discrete-time
2611869~003670~we don't have any particular problem with that if you think about convolved
2615539~001310~in these together
2616849~003430~it's a straightforward mathematical operation
2620279~003500~since the impulse in continue in discrete-time
2623779~003550~is very nicely defined
2627329~003760~however in continuous-time we have to be somewhat careful
2631089~003220~about the definition at the impulse because
2634309~003641~it was the derivative a step-by-step has a discontinuity
2637950~003280~you can't really differentiate at a discontinuity
2641230~003020~in the way that we dealt with that was
2644250~003680~to expand out the discontinuity so that
2647930~003189~it had some finite time region in which it happen
2651119~004051~when we did that we ended up with a definition for the impulse
2655170~004070~which was the limiting or up this function
2659240~003240~which is a rectangle with Delta
2662480~004650~and height one over Delta and an area equal to 1
2667130~004149~now if we think I'll convolved being
2671279~003601~this signal with itself the impose being a limiting
2674880~003649~former this then the convolution
2678529~003520~up this with itself is a triangle
2682049~003341~with to Delta height1 over Delta
2685390~003040~in area 1 in other words
2688430~003149~this triangular function is this
2691579~003351~approximation delta sig Delta T
2694930~004129~can't fault with dealt this adult T
2699059~003191~and since this would then
2702250~005259~the limited this would correspond to the impulse response
2707509~003250~all the identity system
2710759~003701~convolved with itself the implication is
2714460~003049~that not only should the top
2717509~003840~function this one
2721349~003351~correspond in its limiting form to an impulse
2724700~003540~but also this should correspond it is limiting
2728240~005099~form to an impulse so one could wonder well what is an impulse is it
2733339~006250~this one in the limit or is that this one in the limit
2739589~003230~now beyond that there
2742819~003200~so kinda what this suggests is that in the limiting
2746019~003270~for me kinda run into a contradiction unless you don't
2749289~003901~try to distinguish between this rectangle in the Triangle
2753190~003099~things get even worse when you think about
2756289~002980~what happens when you put an impulse into a differentiator in a
2759269~004401~differentiator is a very commonly occurring system
2763670~003300~in particular suppose we had a system for which
2766970~004079~the output was the derivative of the input
2771049~003570~so if we put in extra T we got out the exit
2774619~006490~the DT if I put in an impulse or if I talked about the impulse response what
2781109~002051~is that
2783160~003340~and of course the problem is that if
2786500~004069~you think that the impossible self is very badly behaved
2790569~004240~then what about its derivative which is not only
2794809~003540~infinitely big but there's a positive going on in negative going one in the
2798349~002180~difference between a handsome area
2800529~005441~and you your end up in a lot of difficult
2805970~004930~well the way around this formally is through
2810900~005310~a set of mathematics refer to as generalized functions
2816210~003819~we won't be quite that formal but I'd like to at least
2820029~003861~suggest with the essence that formality is and it really
2823890~005760~helps us in interpreting the impulses and steps and functions at that time
2829650~003520~and what it is is operational definition
2833170~003310~love steps impulses and their derivatives
2836480~004109~in the following sense: usually when we talk about a function
2840589~004401~we talk about what the bag with the function is at any instant of time
2844990~003819~course the trouble with an impulse is it's infinitely bigan 0 within has some
2848809~002240~areas center
2851049~003341~well we can turn to is what is referred to as
2854390~003179~and operational definition where
2857569~003821~the operational definition
2861390~003530~is related not to what the impulses
2864920~003030~but to what the impulse does under
2867950~003359~the operation convolution so
2871309~003200~what is an impulse and impose is
2874509~004981~something which under convolution retains the function
2879490~004740~and net then conserve as a definition of the imports
2884230~004049~well let's see where that gets us suppose that we now
2888279~005111~want to talk about the derivative up the in polls
2893390~003080~well what we ask about is
2896470~004750~what it is operationally and so if we have a system
2901220~004319~which is a differentiator an
2905539~003681~we inquire about it's impossible response which let's say we define
2909220~003680~rotationally as you serve 180
2912900~003820~what's important about this function you serve one ft
2916720~003410~is not what it is at each value time
2920130~003760~but what it does under convolution
2923890~003379~what is it doing a convolution well the
2927269~003270~output the differentiator is the convolution
2930539~004820~up the input with the impulse response and so what you serve 180 does on the
2935359~000930~convolution
2936289~003540~is to differentiate
2939829~003980~and Nat is the operational definition
2943809~003641~and now of course we can think extending net
2947450~003990~not only would we want to think about differentiating
2951440~003690~an impulse but we would also what about
2955130~003639~want to think about differentiating the derivative opinion polls
2958769~004240~will define that as a function use up to eighty
2963009~003030~use up to 50 because we have
2966039~004181~this impulse response convolved with this one is you wanna T convolved you
2970220~001510~wanna T
2971730~003150~and what is you 280
2974880~003379~operationally it is
2978259~003401~the operation such that when you can ball
2981660~003159~that with except he what you get
2984819~003740~is the second derivative
2988559~003270~okay now we can carry this further and in fact
2991829~003220~talk about the result I'll involving
2995049~003570~you wanna TE with itself
2998619~003271~more times in fact if we think that the convolution
3001890~004209~or you want it T with it so k times
3006099~005250~then logically we define that as use a Kft
3011349~003500~again we would interpret that operationally
3014849~003071~and the operational definition is through
3017920~005169~convolution where this corresponds to
3023089~003091~use a cave T in the impulse response
3026180~003470~love k differentiators in cascade
3029650~004149~so what is the operational definition well it simply
3033799~004381~that except the convolved with you sir kute
3038180~004010~is the K derivative
3042190~003480~accept T and
3045670~004619~this now gives us a set 0 what are referred to as singularity functions
3050289~001320~very well
3051609~003760~badly behaved mathematically in a sense but
3055369~005420~as we've seen reasonably well defined under an operational definition
3060789~003431~the cake was 0 incidently that's the same as
3064220~005170~what we have referred to previously as the impulse so
3069390~003879~cake 0 that's just dealt T
3073269~004810~now to be completely can also go the other way and talk about
3078079~003700~the impulse response a string 'em integrators instead of a string it
3081779~001750~differentiators
3083529~004050~course the impulse response a single integrator is a unit step
3087579~003331~to integrators together is the integral the units that
3090910~003169~et cetera an that
3094079~003101~likewise corresponds to
3097180~003149~a Sat Nav what are called singularity functions
3100329~003490~in particular if I take string or
3103819~004321~am integrators in cascade
3108140~003750~then the impulse response that is
3111890~004139~denoted as use up minus MFT
3116029~004320~and for example with a single in a greater use up minus 150
3120349~003760~corresponds to are unit step
3124109~004861~as we've talked about previously use a -2 ft
3128970~003899~our spines to unit ramp
3132869~005871~et cetera and there is in fact a reason for choosing negative values have the
3138740~002180~argument
3140920~003919~when going in one direction here integration as compared with positive
3144839~001551~values the argument we going
3146390~003510~in the other direction namely differentiation
3149900~004119~in in particular we know bad
3154019~003990~with uses my sms to the
3158009~003560~the operational definition is the AM
3161569~003811~running into kroll and
3165380~003040~like why is use a Kft
3168420~005000~so with a positive subscript has an operational definition
3173420~003339~which is the derivative so
3176759~004570~if the Cape derivative exit T
3181329~003270~and in partly as a consequence if that
3184599~003341~if we take use it Kft
3187940~003619~and convolved it with use ability the result
3191559~004500~is this the singularity function with the subscript which is the sum
3196059~003010~K&L and that holds whether
3199069~004210~this is positive values that the subscript or negative values at the
3203279~001470~subscript
3204749~003260~so just to summarize this last discussion
3208009~003030~we've used an operational definition to
3211039~004510~talk about derivatives love impulses
3215549~003240~and integrals impulses this led
3218789~004191~to said a singularity functions work all singularity functions of which
3222980~003150~the impulse in the stepper two examples by
3226130~003580~using an operational definition through convolution
3229710~003659~allows us to to find
3233369~004271~at least an operational sense these functions that otherwise a very badly
3237640~003490~a
3241130~003939~okay now in in this lecture in
3245069~004141~previous lectures for the most part our discussion has
3249210~003960~been about linear time-invariant systems
3253170~003270~fairly general terms and we've seen a variety
3256440~003629~properties representation through convolution
3260069~005690~and properties as they can be associated with the impulse response
3265759~004490~next lecture will turn our attention to a very important
3270249~005641~subclass those systems namely systems that are described below beilin your
3275890~001530~constant coefficient
3277420~003419~difference equations in the discrete-time case and when your car is
3280839~001170~the coefficient
3282009~003401~differential equations in the continuous-time case
3285410~003419~those classes while not
3288829~003821~forming all the classic linear time-invariant systems
3292650~004830~are very important subclass and will focus in on those specifically next
3297480~000299~thank you
