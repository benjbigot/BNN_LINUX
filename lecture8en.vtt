00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the No

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for last time

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we began to address the issue a building continuous-time signals out a linear

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
combination of complex exponentials

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and for the class a periodic signals

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
specifically what this led to was the Fourier series representation

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for periodic signals let me just summarize

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the result that we develop last time for

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
periodic signals we had the continuous-time for you

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
for a series where we built

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the periodic signal I dove a linear combination

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
love harmonically related complex exponentials

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and what that led to was what we refer to as

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the synthesis equation and we

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
briefly address the issue love when this in fact bills

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
when this in fact is a complete representation at the periodic signal

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and in essence what we presented was

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
conditions either Forex city being square integrable

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or X-eighty being absolutely inevitable

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
then the other cited the for a series

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is what I refer to as the analysis equation

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and the analysis equation was the equation the told us how

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we yet the forty a series coefficients

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from x50 and so this equation

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
together with the synthesis equation represent

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the forty a series description for periodic signals

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
now we'd like to do is

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
extend this idea to provide a mechanism

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
for building not periodic signals also I have a linear combination

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
complex exponentials and the

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
basic idea behind doing this is very simple

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and also very clever as i indicated last time essentially

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the thought is the following if we have a non periodic signal or a periodic

00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
signal

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
we can think love constructing a periodic signal

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
by simply periodically replicating

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that a periodic signal so

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for example if I have in a periodic signal

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
as i've indicated here I can consider

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
building a periodic signal where

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I simply take this original signal

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and repeated at multiples love some period t0

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
now two things to recognize about this one

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
is that the periodic signal

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
is equal to the a periodic signal

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
over one period and the second is that as the period

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
goes to infinity then in fact

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the periodic signal goes to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the a periodic signal so

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the basic idea then is

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to use the free a series to represent

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the periodic signal and then examine the 4e a serious expression

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
as we let the period go to infinity well

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
let's quickly see how this develops

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
interns up the Associated equations here

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
again we have the periodic

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
signal and what we want to inquire

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
into is what happens to the forty a serious expression for this

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
as we let the period go to infinity as that happens

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
whatever for a series representation we end up with

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
will correspond also to a representation for this a periodic signal

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
well let's see the forty a series

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
synthesis expressions for the periodic signal expresses

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
extol dirty the periodic signal as a linear combination

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
of harmonically related complex exponentials

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
with the fundamental frequency Omega 0

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
equal to 25 divided by the period and

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the analysis equation tells us

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
what the relationship is for the coefficients

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
interns are the periodic signal now I indicated

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that the periodic signal and the a periodic signal

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
are equal over one period we recognize

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that this integration in fact only occurs over one period

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and so we can really express this interns

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
all our original a periodic signal so this tells us the for a series

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
coefficients

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
interns affect safety

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
okay now

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
if in we look at this expression which is the expression for the 4e

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
coefficients the a periodic signal one other things to recognize

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is dead in effect what

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
this represents are samples

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
all an integral where

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
we can think all the variable Omega

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
taking on values better integer multiples

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Omega 0 said another way let's define a function as i've indicated here

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
which is this in a brawl where

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and we may think it will make a as being a continuous variable

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then the forty a series coefficients correspond

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to substituting Omega

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is for Omega K

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Omega 0 now one reason for doing that as we'll see is that in fact

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
this will turn out to provide us with the mechanism

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
for forty-a representation affect safety

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and this in fact and is an on below

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
all the four EA series coefficients

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
in other words t0 the period times the coefficients

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
is equal so this integral at integer multiples

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Omega 0

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
okay so this effect tells us how to get the for a series coefficients the

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
periodic signal

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
interns love samples of an envelope and that will become a very important notion

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
shortly and in

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
that in effect will correspond to an analysis equation

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to represent the a periodic signal now let's look at the synthesis equation

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
group call that in the synthesis our strategy is

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to build a periodic signal and let the period go to infinite

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
well here is the expression

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
for the synthesis the periodic signal

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
now expressed interns

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll samples of this envelope function

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and where I've simply use the fact that the substitution

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that t0 is to pile for Omega 0 and so I have an Omega 0 here

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and a 1-over to pie and the reason for doing that

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
as we'll see in a minute is that this then turns into an integral

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
specifically then the synthesis equation

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that we have is

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
what i've indicated here we would now want to examine this

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
as the period goes to infinity which means that

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Omega 0 becomes infinitesimally small

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and without dwelling on the details

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and with my suggesting that you give this a fair amount of reflection

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
in fact what happens as the period goes to infinity

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is that this some Asian approach is an integral

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
over Omega where Omega 0 becomes the differential

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and Omega and the periodic signal of course

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
approaches the a periodic sick so

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the resulting equation that we get outta

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the original for a series synthesis equation

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is the equation

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that I indicate down here X if T

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
synthesized interns all this

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
integral which is what the forty a series approaches

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
as Omega 0 goes to zero and

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
we had previously that XO maker

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
was in fact an envelope function

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and we have then the corresponding for EA transform analysis equation

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
which tells us how we arrive at that envelope

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
interns love accept T okay so

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we now have and analysis equation and

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
synthesis equation which in effect expresses 4s

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
how to build XFT interns or

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if into tears and we finally space complex exponentials

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the strategy to review it

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and which I'd like to illustrate with

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
a succession of overlays was

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to begin up

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
with are a periodic signal as

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I indicate here

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and then reconstructed from that a periodic signal

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and in this periodic signal has a forty a series

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and we express the for a series coefficients if this

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
as samples all an envelope function

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the envelope function is what I indicate on the curve below

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so this is the envelope above the 40 a series coefficients

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
for example if the period t0

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
was four times t1 in the 4a series coefficients

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that we would end up with is this set

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
samples of the and below if

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
instead we double that period

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
then the Fourier series coefficients that we end up with

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
are more finally space

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and as t0

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
continues to increase we get more and more

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
finally space samples love this envelope function

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and as t0 goes to infinity in fact what we get

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is every single point on the envelope and that provides is

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
with the representation for

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the a periodic sick let me just to

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
really emphasize the point

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
show this example once again but now

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
let's look at it dynamically on the computer display

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
so here we have the square wave in below it

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the for a series coefficients we now want to look at the for a series

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
coefficients

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
as the period at the square wave starts to increase

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and what we see is that these look

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
like samples love an envelope

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and in fact the envelope for the Fourier series coefficients

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
is shown in the bottom trace and emphasize in fact that it is the

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
envelope

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
let's superimpose it on top of the Fourier series coefficients that we've

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
generated so far

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
okay now let's increase the period

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
even further and we'll see the for a series

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
coefficients billion under that

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
envelope function even more and in fact

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
as the period gets large enough what we

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
begin to get a sense love is

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that we're sampling more and more finally

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
this and below and in fact in the limit as the period goes off to infinity

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the samples basically will represent every

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
single point on the envelope well this is about as far as you want to go

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
let's once again plot the envelope function

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and again to emphasize that we've generated samples a bad

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
let superimpose that on the forty a series coefficients

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
okay so what we have then is

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
now are forty-a transform

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
representation the continuous time Fourier transform

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
with the synthesis equation

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
expressed as an integral as they've indicated here

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and this integral is what

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the four th series some went to

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
as we let the period go to infinity

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
where the frequency go to zero the corresponding

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
analysis equation which we have here the analysis equation

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
being the expression for the on below

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
up to 40 a series coefficients for the periodically

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
replicated signal and in shorthand notation

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
we would think affects if T

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and its Fourier transform as a pair

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
as i've indicated here and the Fourier transform

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
as will emphasize in several examples and certainly

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
as is consistent with the forty a series is

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
a complex value function even when accepting israel's so would accept the

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
real

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
we end up with the 48 transform which is a complex function

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
just as the for you series coefficients were complex

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
for real value time function

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
so we could alternatively as with the 4e a series

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
express the Fourier transform it turns

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
love its real part an imaginary part

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
or alternatively interns

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
love its magnet to and its angle

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
all right now let's look at an example

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
love a time function and its Fourier transform

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and so let's consider

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
an example which in fact is an example worked out in the tax that's

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
example 4.7 tax and missus are all familiar friend

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the exponential

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
its Fourier transform is the integral from minus infinity plus infinity X

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
thirty

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
either the minus J Omega TDT and

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
so if we substitute in exit to the and

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
combine these two exponentials together these two exponentials

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
combined are he to the minus the

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
times a-plus jail mega and

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
if we carry out the integration

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
love this we end up with the expression

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
indicated here and provided

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
now in this is important provided

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that a is greater than 0

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and at the upper limit this exponential become 0

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
at the lower limit of course it's one and so

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
what we have finally is the for the

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Fourier transform expression one over a plus

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
jail make

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
okay now this Fourier transform as i indicated

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
is a complex valued function let's just

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
take a look at what it looks like graphically

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we have

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the expression the Fourier transform pair

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
either the minus eighty times a step and its forty-eight transformers one over

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
a place J Omega and I indicated

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
dead that's true for a greater than 0

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
now in the expression that we just worked out

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
if a is less than 0 in fact the

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
the expression doesn't converge the

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to the -84 a negative

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
as he goes to infinity blows up

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and so in fact the 48 transform doesn't converge

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in the case except for the case were a is greater than 0

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and in fact there's a more detailed discussion of convergence issues in the

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,000
tax

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the convergence issues are very much the same

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the Fourier transform as they are for the four th series in fact that's not

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
surprising because

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
we develop the Fourier transform out of consideration

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
for you series so the convergence conditions as you'll see as you refer a

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
detailed

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
tax relate to whether the time function is

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
absolutely integral under one set of conditions

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and square integrable under another set of conditions

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
okay now if we plot the Fourier transform

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
let's first consider the shape at the time function

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and as i indicated way restricting the time function

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
so that the exponential factor is positive in other words you the -80

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
detainees as he goes to infinity the magnitude

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
or the for EA transform

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is as i indicate here and

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the phase below it and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
think there are a number of things that we can see about

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
the magnitude and phase

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the 48 transform for this example which in fact we'll see

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in the next lecture are properties that apply more generally

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for example the fact that the 48 transform magnitude is an even function

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
frequency and the phase is an odd function of frequency

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
now let me also draw your attention

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
so the fact there'd on this curve we have

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
both positive frequencies and negative frequencies

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
in other words in our expression for the 48 transform

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we've it requires both or make a positive

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and Omega negative this of course was exactly the same in the case

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the for a series and the reason you should

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
recalling keep in mind is related to the fact that we're building our signals

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
out of complex exponentials which require both

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
positive values have Omega and negative values Omega alternatively if we chose

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
another representation which turns and occasionally to be much more difficult

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
namely sines and cosines that we would in fact

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
only consider positive frequencies so it's important to keep in mind

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that in our case both with the for a series in the 48 transform

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we deal and require both positive and negative frequencies

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in order to build their signals

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
now in the graphical representation that I shown here

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I've chosen a linear amplitude scale

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and a linear frequency scale and thats one

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
graphical representation the Fourier transform

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that will typically use is another one

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
that very commonly arises and

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
which all just briefly indicate for this example

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and that is was referred to

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
as a boat imply in which the

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
magnet to is displayed on a large amplitude in like frequency scale

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in the phase is displayed on a lock frequency scale

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
let me show you what I me here is

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
the general expression for the boat reply body plot

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
expresses 4s the amp with two interns

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the longer them to the base 10 the magnitude

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and it also expresses the angle in both cases

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
express as as a function

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
love a logarithmic speak with yes so

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
here is the amplitude

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
as i've displayed at and

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
this is a log magnitude scale a logarithmic

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
frequency scale as indicated by the fact that as we move

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
include equal increments along this axis we change

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
frequency by a factor 10 and

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
similarly what we

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
have is a display for the phase again

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
on a light frequency scale and I indicated

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
dead there is a symmetry to the Fourier transform

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and so in fact we can infer from this particular picture

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
what it looks like to the negative frequencies as well as for the positive

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
returns

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
okay now

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
what we've

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
done so far is to develop

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
the for EA transform on the basis

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the Fourier transform it a periodic signal on the basis

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
periodically repeating it and recognizing

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that the for a series coefficients are samples of an envelope

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
on an envelope and that these become more finally space

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
as frequency increases and in fact

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
we can go back to are

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
original equation

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in which we developed an envelope function

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and what we had indicated

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is dead the 4e a series

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
coefficients where samples of this envelope

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
we then

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to find this envelope as

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
the Fourier transform all this a periodic signal so

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that provided us with the way and it was a mechanism

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
for getting a representation for a periodic sick

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
now suppose that we have instead

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
a periodic signal are there in fact

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
some statements that we can make about how the Fourier series coefficients

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that are related to the Fourier transform of something well

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
in fact this statement tells us

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
exactly how to do that what this statement says

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is that in fact the forty a series coefficients

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
our samples all the four EA transform

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
up one period so if

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
we now consider

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a periodic signal weekend in fact

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
get before a series coefficients that periodic signal

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
by considering the Fourier transform

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
above one period said another way the 4e a series coefficients

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
are proportional samples on the Fourier transform

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
one period so if we consider this

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
a periodic signal computer its Fourier transform

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and selected these

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
samples that I indicate here

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
namely samples equally spaced in omega

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
in by multiples are integer multiples

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
love Omega 0 then in fact

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
those would be the story a series coefficients

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
so we can go back to

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
are example previously

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
with that involved the

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
square wave and now

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
in this case we could argue that if in fact

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it was the periodic signal that we started with

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
we could get the 40 series coefficients

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that by thinking about

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the four EA transform above one period

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
which I indicate here and then

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the 48 series coefficients other periodic signal

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
in fact are the appropriate set

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
samples of this envelope

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
alright now we have away

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
love getting the for a series coefficients

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
from the Fourier transform one period we originally derived

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the Fourier transform one period from the 48 series

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
what would in fact be nice

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
is if we could incorporate before a series

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
in the Fourier transform within a common framework

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and in fact it turns out dead there

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is a very convenient way of doing that almost by definition

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
essentially

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
if we consider what the equation

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
for the synthesis looks like in both cases we

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
can in effect define of four EA transform

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
for the periodic signal which we know is represented by its for a series

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
coefficients we can define

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
48 transform and the definition of the Fourier transform

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is as an impulse train where the coefficients in the impulse train

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
are proportional with the proportionality factor

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
25 for more less a bookkeeping reason proportional to the forty a series

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
coefficients

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and the validity of this is

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
more or less can be seen

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
essentially by substitution specifically

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
here is then the

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
synthesis equation for the four EA transform

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
if we substitute this definition for the four th chance for the periodic signal

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and interchange the order some Asian and integration

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
the in polls integrates out to

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the exponential factor that we want so

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
we have the exponential factor we have the for a series coefficients

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the two pies take care of each other and what we're left with

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is the synthesis equation for

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
a periodic signal in terms of the Fourier transform foreign it interns

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
love it's for a series coefficients right now

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
we can just see this interns

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
love a simple example if we

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
consider the example love a symmetric square wave

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
then in effect what we're saying is that

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
for this symmetric square wave this has

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
set up for a series coefficients which we work that previously

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and which I indicate on this figure

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
with a bar graph and really all that were saying

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
is there whereas these free a series coefficients our index

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
on an integer variable K and their bars not impulses

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
if we simply redefine or define

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the Fourier transform love the periodic signal

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
as an impulse train where the weights at the impulses

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
are to Paul II times the

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
correspondent for a series coefficients and

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
this in fact is what we would use as the four EA

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
transform love the periodic sick

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
okay now we've kind of gone back and forth

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
on and maybe even it might seem

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
likely going around in circles so let me just

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
try to summarize the various relationships

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and steps that we've gone through keeping in mind that

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
one of our objectives was first to develop

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
representation for a periodic signals and then attempt to

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
incorporate within one framework both periodic

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
in a periodic signals

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
we began with

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and a periodic signal

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and the strategy was to develop

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
for your representation by constructing

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
periodic signal for which that was one period

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in and then we let the period go to infinity as

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I indicate here so we have and a periodic signal

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
we construct a periodic signal

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
extol dirty for which one period

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
is the a periodic signal X still dirty the periodic signal has a forty a series

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and as its period increases

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that approaches the a periodic signal and

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the forty a series of that approaches the 48 transform

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
all the original a periodic sick so

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that was the first step that we took

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
now the second thing that we recognize is dead

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
once we have the concept to the 48 transform

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
we can in fact relate the Fourier series coefficients

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
to the 48 transform one period

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
so the second statement that we made was dead

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
if in fact we're trying to represent a periodic signal

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
we can get the 40 series coefficients have that

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
by computing the for EA transform

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
one period and then

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
samples that for EA transform are

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
in fact the 4e series coefficients for the periodic sick

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
okay then the third step that we took was

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
to inquire as to whether they're is a Fourier transform

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that can appropriately be defined for

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the periodic signal in the mechanism for doing that

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
was to recognize that if we simply to find the Fourier transform

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
the periodic signal as an impulse train where the in polls

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
fights or areas for proportional to the for a series coefficients

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
then in fact the Fourier transform

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
synthesis equation reduced to

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
before you see recent this equation so the third step

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
then was with a periodic signal

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
the 48 transform that periodic signal

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
defined as an impulse train with the heights or areas the impulses are

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
proportional to the forty a series coefficients

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
provides us with the mechanism for

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
combining together the concepts war

00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
notation love before you a series and Fourier transform so

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
if we just took I E very simple example

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
here is an example in which

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
we have and a periodic signal

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
which is just an impulse and its

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
for EA transform is just a constant

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
we can think other periodic signal

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
associated with this which is this signal

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
periodically replicated in with the spacing t0

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the Fourier transform love this is a constant

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and this of course has a forty a series representation

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so the Fourier transform or

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the original in polls is just a constant the Fourier transform

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
love the periodic signal is

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
an impulse train where the heights at the impulses

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
are proportional to the forty a series coefficients

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and of course we could previously have computed

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the forty a series coefficients to that imposed strain

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and those for a series coefficients are as I've shown here

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
so on both these cases these in effect

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
represent just a change in notation we're here we have a bar graph in here

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
we have been imposed strain

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and both at the is simply represent

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
samples of what we have above

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
which is the for EA transform

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
love the original a periodic sick

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
okay now once again I suspect that kinda

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
moving back and forth and and trying to straighten out when we're talking about

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
periodic in a periodic signals

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
may require a little mental gymnastics initially

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
basically what we try to do is

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
incorporate within one framework representation for both

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
a periodic and and periodic signals in the Fourier transform

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
provides us with a mechanism to do that

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
in the next lecture I'll continue with the discussion

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
or the continuous-time for EA transform in particular focusing

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
on a number of its properties summer which we've already seen namely the

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
symmetry properties

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
we'll see lots of other properties that relate

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of course both to the 48 transform and to the for users

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
thank you
