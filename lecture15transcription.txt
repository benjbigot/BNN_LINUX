052989~004861~in the last lecture we begin
057850~004880~the discussion love modulation and in particular what we focused on
062730~005620~was the continuous-time case and in talking about continuous-time modulation
068350~002730~we covered a number of topics we talked about
071080~003039~the properties and analysis love
074119~004541~modulation when we had a complex exponential
078660~005280~carrier signal we talked about the properties and analysis in the case of a
083940~001550~sinusoidal carrier
085490~004030~and in that context and related to
089520~003580~the application associated with communications
093100~003049~we talked about synchronous modulation
096149~003261~a synchronous modulation and
099410~003500~also the notion love single sideband
102910~003010~modulation in
105920~005600~the lecture today there are to issues that I'd like to address broad topics
111520~003640~one is Acer parallel discussion
115160~005400~particularly is associated with complex exponential sinusoidal modulation
120560~003350~for discrete-time signals and
123910~003150~the second is the introduction and analysis
127060~005460~love a another kind of carriers specifically a post kind of carrier
132520~005020~in continuous time leading to the notions of pulse amplitude modulation
137540~004770~and eventually a very powerful theramin result called the sampling there
142310~004300~well let me begin the lecture though focusing on
146610~004150~the discrete-time modulation to essentially
150760~004729~draw your attention to the fact dead the analysis and discrete-time
155489~003741~very much parallels the analysis in continuous-time
159230~004220~well let's consider in the discrete-time
163450~003619~case just as we had in continuous-time a
167069~003471~signal modulating a carrier signal
170540~003510~and the resulting modulated signal
174050~003400~is why event and it was
177450~004080~in continuous-time the modulation property
181530~003860~Associated with the four EA transform dead
185390~005190~provided the basis for the analysis and exactly the same thing is true in a
190580~000750~discrete-time
191330~003550~case in particular what we have in discrete-time
194880~005180~is the modulation property as it relates to the Fourier transform
200060~005290~which tells us that the four EA transform of the modulated signal
205350~003770~is the convolution all the
209120~005610~for a transformer the carrier and the 48 transform or
214730~004730~the modulating signal and the only real difference in issue here
219460~003020~is that in the discrete-time case
222480~003000~what we're talking about is a periodic
225480~003790~convolution because the specter of course a periodic
229270~006490~whereas in a continuous-time case it was an a periodic convolution so let's
235760~004680~parallel the discussion and in particular what will focus on
240440~003400~is first a complex exponential
243840~003479~carrier and second a
247319~004111~sinusoidal carrier and we'll see how this parallels our discussion in
251430~001330~continuous-time
252760~004439~and will make fairly brief reference as we introduce
257199~004820~the post carrier for continuous-time will bring make very brief reference to
262019~001990~the post carrier for discrete-time
264009~004690~indicating that again the analysis and discrete-time and continuous-time
268699~003720~is very parallel soul let's first consider
272419~003081~complex exponential and sinus all carriers
275500~003380~for the discrete-time case emphasizing
278880~003849~the very strong parallel and similarity between
282729~004051~discrete-time and continuous-time well
286780~003970~we have once again the modulation property
290750~003569~and the modulation property tells us that the spectrum
294319~003951~all the modulated signal is the periodic
298270~003810~convolution love the two spectra
302080~003309~and let's consider for example
305389~004091~an input for modulating spectrum as i've indicated here
309480~003420~and since we what to consider first the fall
312900~003420~a complex exponential carrier
316320~003349~will consider the case of CNN
319669~003000~equal to each to the J Omega subsea
322669~003681~n and let me stress by the way as
326350~003800~I did in the continuous-time case
330150~005230~dead out 10 to suppress the phase angle which of course can be associated with
335380~002220~the carrier also
337600~003560~alright so we have then the spectrum
341160~004039~%uh the modulating signal the spektr the carrier signal
345199~004641~if this is the carrier then its spectrum is an impulse train
349840~003049~and then imposed strain I've indicated
352889~004721~here and let me stress also that in
357610~003790~the discrete-time case of course the spectra
361400~005110~and all of the spektr involved are periodic with period of two pi
366510~003510~so this then is the spectrum of the carrier signal
370020~004660~this is the spectrum the input signal the periodic convolution if these two
374680~003890~is the spektr on the modulated signal and the result
378570~003590~is then this spectrum shifted
382160~003770~to center frequency which is the carrier frequency
385930~003170~Omega subsea so
389100~004170~the result love modulation with a complex exponential
393270~003619~is a straightforward shifted the spectrum
396889~003691~to a carrot to so that what occurred around
400580~006339~zero frequency now occurs around the frequency Omega subsea
406919~003511~now in the continuous-time k sweetie modulated
410430~004549~with the case when we had a complex exponential carrier weedy modulated
414979~003000~by essentially just shifting the spectrum back
417979~006181~and he in fact in the discrete-time case were able to do exactly the same thing
424160~003830~so if we work to replace
427990~004610~see a van which is huge and make a subsidy and
432600~003450~by see a very cozy the minus J Omega
436050~003369~CN the resulting spectrum
439419~003241~would be an impulse train
442660~003370~as i indicate here and
446030~004949~the result all multiply why I have an
450979~003071~by that new carrier
454050~003050~in the frequency domain is a convolution if these two
457100~003190~and its relatively straightforward to verify that
460290~003290~if you can follow these for the periodic convolution
463580~005910~then that will get us back to the original spectrum that we started with
469490~004200~so what's happened in the discrete-time case for the complex exponential
473690~003710~is exactly the same as in continuous-time
477400~004060~namely we might too late that corresponds to shifting the spectrum
481460~004410~weedy modulate by multiplying by the complex conjugate
485870~003460~the original modulating care the original carrier
489330~004929~and that shifts the spectrum back to where it was originally
494259~005660~okay now let's consider the case of a sinusoidal carrier in discrete-time
499919~003171~and again things very much parallel
503090~003060~what we saw in continuous-time
506150~003210~and again as we look at the specter
509360~004149~I will choose a phase angle 0
513509~003960~mainly for notational an analytical convenience
517469~003401~so in this case now rather than
520870~003880~a carrier signal which is a single complex exponential
524750~004970~it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the sinus or carrier is the summer too
529720~002609~complex exponentials
532329~005531~and so if we consider a modulating spectrum that is the specter affects a
537860~001409~van
539269~004851~as something are the type that I indicate here
544120~004570~and the spectrum of the carrier
548690~003680~now since the carrier is sign a soil rather than
552370~003719~a complex exponential consists of two impulses
556089~004110~wanted pasta makers see and one at minus Omega subsea
560199~004170~convolved ing this spectrum with this spectrum
564369~003541~gives us a replication affective Omega
567910~004560~around plus and minus Omega subsea
572470~004299~and incidently with an ample to change a hair
576769~003410~so again things have
580179~003410~worked as they did in continuous-time
583589~003040~in continuous time or in discrete-time
586629~003210~modulating with a sinusoidal carrier
589839~004021~with then correspond to a replication of the spectrum
593860~004430~around plus the carrier frequency and replication the spectrum
598290~004479~around minus the carrier frequency in both cases
602769~004850~as long as the carrier frequency is large enough compared with the band with
607619~001241~the signal
608860~003819~so that those two replications don't overlap
612679~003061~then its reasonable to suppose
615740~003569~that we should be able to recover the original signal
619309~003770~well in fact to d modulate
623079~003760~in the discrete-time case we would again
626839~005220~follow very much the strategy that we did in continuous-time
632059~003491~in particular let's consider the modulating
635550~003229~by taking the modulated signal
638779~003191~and again putting it through modulator again
641970~003719~with a carrier which is co-signed Omega CN
645689~003770~if we do that we have a the modulator
649459~005011~or what will turn out to be part of the modulator as i indicate here
654470~003619~the spectrum or the import signal
658089~003970~is as I had just developed a replication
662059~004810~up the original spectrum around plus and minus Omega subsea
666869~003520~with an amplitude of the hair when this
670389~003081~is again convolved with the spectrum
673470~003219~love the carrier then
676689~004340~we get a replication of the original spectrum
681029~004620~first around zero frequency as i indicate here
685649~003961~and then around twice the carrier frequency
689610~003409~and minus twice the carrier frequency
693019~003091~and as long as the carrier frequency
696110~003000~is large enough compared with the
699110~004379~with of the original signal day and as you can see
703489~004611~by extracting this part of the spectrum
708100~003139~with the low-pass filter we can in principle
711239~003570~recover the spectrum associated with the original signal
714809~004991~and again justice in continuous-time because this amplitude is a half
719800~003909~we would want to choose for scaling purposes
723709~003860~a low-pass filter ample to which is
727569~005070~to to compensate for this factor in the hair
732639~004211~so once again things work at basically
736850~003529~the same way as they had in continuous-time
740379~003421~we have sinusoidal modulation
743800~004219~which consists love using a sinusoidal carrier
748019~003490~and we have the the modulator
751509~003690~which consists of taking the modulated signal
755199~003070~multiplying by the carrier and then
758269~004771~processing Matt with a low-pass filter
763040~003130~to extract the portion of the spectrum
766170~007000~which is around zero frequency as i indicate in the spectra below
773170~005269~and the result then with this low pass filter having a gain of two
778439~004440~is that we've recovered the original spectrum
782879~004120~exit Omega which is the spectrum
786999~003150~that we started now
790149~003980~several other things to stress this is a fairly quick
794129~004360~to we're through sinusoidal modulation for discrete-time
798489~003700~in there are very similar issues that arise in
802189~004520~the discrete-time case in terms of love having faced synchronization
806709~004401~and frequency synchronization between the modulator and demodulator
811110~003889~and we had discussed that in a fair amount of detail for the continuous-time
814999~004430~case in some sense in practical terms
819429~004301~that becomes much more than issue in continuous-time
823730~004289~than it does in discrete-time in part because
828019~004600~synchronization between a modulator and demodulator
832619~004270~is often much harder in a continuous-time
836889~003700~system which is essentially an analog system
840589~003440~as compared with a digital system another
844029~004050~very important reason and it's important to stress this at the outset
848079~003510~is that whereas the theory involving
851589~004131~the use of complex exponentials sinusoidal modulation
855720~003549~parallels very strongly in the continuous-time
859269~003920~and the discrete-time case in practical terms
863189~003560~it has much more significance in continuous-time
866749~003260~than it does in discrete-time that is the notion
870009~005320~love sinusoidal modulation in the context of communication systems
875329~004310~is extremely important for continuous-time systems
879639~003070~and less so in discrete-time systems
882709~004630~now kinda as a preview of a point to be raise later on
887339~003300~I should modify that slightly with the statement
890639~003670~that one very important plays in which
894309~005020~sinusoidal modulation in a discrete-time context the rises
899329~007000~is in a class of systems called trance multiplexers or trans modulation systems
906429~003520~and this surface is basically because
909949~003640~so many communication systems are now
913589~003900~becoming digital and specifically discrete-time although the actual
917489~002560~transmission is continuous time
920049~003520~the signal processing manipulation switching
923569~003750~is discrete-time it so in fact it turns out
927319~003490~to be very important and useful to take
930809~003680~a discrete-time representation I love
934489~003400~the analog signals a continuous-time signals
937889~003950~and in a discrete-time or digital representation
941839~003310~convert them from one modulation scheme
945149~003771~41 multiplexing scheme to another and
948920~003430~although I said a lot there that
952350~004209~really requires much more detail to
956559~003710~to develop in any in any sense at all
960269~004141~you should come to get the notion that that discrete-time
964410~003339~modulation systems become very important
967749~005340~in part because or implementation Elis use
973089~003261~okay now there is another application
976350~004599~dead we have discussed for both continuous time actually previously for
980949~001630~discrete-time
982579~005050~amplitude modulation with sinusoidal or complex exponential carriers
987629~005540~and let me just remind you that because in fact it becomes a very important one
993169~003830~in the case love discrete-time systems
996999~003120~and that is the notion love using
1000119~003950~modulation together with fixed filtering
1004069~003221~to implement a filter which is
1007290~003239~which either has a variable cut off or
1010529~004071~converts let's say a low-pass filter to a high pass filter
1014600~004609~we originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property
1019209~004120~in the context of converting a low-pass filter
1023329~003911~to a high pass filter and the notion was
1027240~003849~that if we modulate the signal
1031089~004870~with a carrier which is -1 to the end and that's just simply complex
1035959~001051~exponential
1037010~005539~or sinusoidal carrier with a carrier frequency of pie
1042549~005471~than that in effect interchanges the low frequencies in the high frequencies
1048020~003820~and if and after modulation
1051840~004280~that is processed with a low pass filter
1056120~004660~and then the result is d modulated
1060780~003960~using exactly the same carrier namely a carrier which is
1064740~003120~-1 to the end
1067860~003890~then the effective that is equivalent
1071750~004390~to high-pass filtering on the original signal
1076140~003570~and a generalization a bad would involve instead a
1079710~003290~this specific choice if -1 to the end
1083000~005070~would involve a choice in general or the e to the J Omega sed CNN
1088070~003670~that is a more general carrier frequency and
1091740~003250~d modulator which is either the minus J
1094990~003990~Omega subsea and and as i've represented here
1098980~004770~and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for
1103750~001650~discrete-time signals
1105400~003550~we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass
1108950~001150~filter
1110100~004010~well let me continue the review of that
1114110~004740~just by reminding you of the details of what happens with the spectra
1118850~003030~and specifically the notion
1121880~004130~if we take this particular case omega-6 equal
1126010~005950~to pie or covertly a carrier signal which is -1 to the end
1131960~005340~then if we have the original spectra
1137300~003200~and the specter all
1140500~004980~specter of the carrier signal the spectrum of the carrier signal
1145480~003060~convolved with this spectrum
1148540~004090~will then in effect shift this by
1152630~003120~pie and so after
1155750~003190~modulating the result that we have is
1158940~005000~shifted that spectrum so that what happened at low frequencies now happens
1163940~002790~at high frequencies namely around pie
1166730~004940~and what happens at what happened at high frequencies now happens
1171670~004730~at low frequencies well if thats process now
1176400~005170~with a low pass filter and this dashed line indicates the low-pass filter
1181570~004220~then the result that we get is shown here
1185790~004840~where we've extracted the low-frequency portion of the modulated signal
1190630~005310~and now when we modulate or D modulate back
1195940~004690~then this spectrum is shifted back to where it belongs
1200630~004370~namely its shifted back to be centered around
1205000~003730~minus pie and around plus Park
1208730~004260~so if we just compare this spectrum
1212990~003400~with the original spectrum at the top
1216390~003030~what we can see is that in effect what we've done
1219420~004210~is to extract a portion of the spectrum
1223630~004760~acquittal and the processing with a high pass filter
1228390~005310~and again this is very similar to what we did in continuous-time
1233700~003920~and all of the kinda analytical processes and
1237620~003410~and convolutions involved are very much the same
1241030~003710~really the biggest difference between continuous-time and discrete-time
1244740~004220~has to do not so much with the details of the analysis but
1248960~003150~perhaps has more to do with issues
1252110~007000~love are practical applications
1259120~003350~okay well so what we've done
1262470~003670~so far for continuous-time and discrete-time
1266140~005130~is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation
1271270~004270~with complex exponential and sinus or carriers
1275540~003430~we saw that the analysis is very similar although
1278970~004320~applications are slightly different and now what I'd like to turn to
1283290~003100~is a different choice love
1286390~004000~carrier signal and the carrier signal in this particular case
1290390~003330~is a post rain rather than
1293720~003860~a sinusoidal signal now
1297580~005290~the idea is the following
1302870~003120~in general of course the modulator
1305990~003430~it consists all multiplying x50
1309420~003820~by whatever the carrier signal is and
1313240~004220~previously we've talked about a carrier signal which is sinusoidal
1317460~003050~the carrier signal that we want to consider now
1320510~003320~is a carrier signal which in fact is
1323830~003330~a pulse train and so in fact
1327160~004080~what we want to do is multiply the input signal
1331240~004780~by a Paul strain and in effect then
1336020~003210~the modulated signal consists
1339230~005140~of the original signal simply with time slices pulled out a bit as i've
1344370~001730~indicated in the bottom Kurt
1346100~003050~so what we have now
1349150~003430~is a modulated signal
1352580~003870~that is a chopped or sliced version
1356450~003940~love the original waveform and
1360390~005940~think that is what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation
1366330~004610~now it seems like it's kinda crazy idea any ideas
1370940~003140~search opt-out slices away form and
1374080~003610~the hope that you can kinda put things back together again
1377690~004530~and the amazing thing about it is we'll see is that in fact
1382220~003970~under fairly broad general and applicability
1386190~005460~conditions you really can put the way for back together again
1391650~003060~if you just have these times places
1394710~003340~not only that but that basic notion
1398050~003900~as we'll see is independent in fact
1401950~003990~up with the with the those time slices or effect the with can go to zero
1405940~004540~and in fact we're going to make the with go to zero and really only dependent
1410480~005220~on what the frequency love the polls trainers
1415700~003260~so let's explore that in some detail
1418960~005660~and what we want to look at is the analysis but let me
1424620~003640~let me first just comment very briefly there
1428260~004160~all the analysis we go through as has been true in the case a sinusoidal
1432420~003730~modulation all the analysis that we go through
1436150~003450~holes just as well with
1439600~003790~especially minor analytical modifications to
1443390~004270~discrete-time pulse amplitude modulation as it does to
1447660~003060~continuous-time pulse amplitude modulation
1450720~003140~and so will really only go through this
1453860~003970~in terms of tracking the way for inspector for the continuous-time
1457830~004130~case but bear in mind that the results are basically similar
1461960~005080~for discrete-time okay well
1467040~003050~let's see how we get the basic result
1470090~003030~that we want to get
1473120~003040~what we have is a
1476160~004720~modulating signal which is a pulse train basically a square wave
1480880~004830~and as we've seen in previous lectures the spectra
1485710~004720~or Fourier transform associated with that is an impulse train
1490430~003330~and the envelope that impulse train
1493760~003680~is over for over sin x over X function
1497440~005510~the four th transform is impulses and the spacing of the impulses
1502950~004830~is Associated with the fundamental frequency
1507780~004570~all the Paul strain and thats Omega Sappi so make it appears to pride
1512350~001310~divided by the period
1513660~003670~the pulse train and at the
1517330~004630~amplitude and shape but this envelope is dictated
1521960~003020~by that parameter Delta
1524980~003660~which has to do with how wide the pulses are
1528640~003470~okay so we have a time function
1532110~004410~it's multiplied by this post rain now we're talking continuous-time
1536520~003100~so in the frequency domain
1539620~004520~we have the Fourier transform the time function convolved with
1544140~004050~this Fourier transform for the pulse train and let's see what that looks like
1548190~003360~if we were to consider let's say
1551550~005040~a Fourier transform which I A kinda chosen is more or less a general one
1556590~003850~then in fact when we can follow this
1560440~004240~with this simple strain what we end up with
1564680~003950~is a replication all
1568630~003240~this spectrum at
1571870~003530~the places in the frequency domain
1575400~003870~where the individual impulses occurred
1579270~004500~so we can see that this spectrum is replicated at each's
1583770~003750~these locations and as long as
1587520~003020~the frequency
1590540~004060~above the post-training is large enough compared
1594600~003670~with a maximum frequency in the
1598270~006630~original single X if T so that there is no overlap between these triangles
1604900~004010~then what you can see in fact somewhat amazingly
1608910~004510~is dead simply by low-pass filtering the result
1613420~003660~we can get back except for an amplitude factor
1617080~003130~we can give get back to the original signal
1620210~004310~now it's amazing it really is amazing
1624520~003340~dead all that this depends on
1627860~003420~is the original signal being banned limited
1631280~003910~and the frequency the post-training be high enough
1635190~004070~so that when you replicate the spectrum in the frequency domain
1639260~003790~is no overlap between these individual replications and will
1643050~003320~have a dress that a little more in a few minutes
1646370~003210~but let me first the ball point out that
1649580~003780~this has a whole variety a very important implications
1653360~003270~one is in the context of communications
1656630~003250~it leads to another very important
1659880~004720~multiplexing scheme for communications we talked last time about
1664600~004340~frequency division multiplexing where individual signals were put into
1668940~002060~individual frequency slots
1671000~004240~by choosing different carrier frequencies for sinusoidal modulated
1675240~001200~signal
1676440~003600~what this suggests is that what we can do
1680040~003480~is put the
1683520~003980~sons put different signals into
1687500~003300~non-overlapping time slots
1690800~004150~and in fact be able to recover the original signals back again
1694950~003080~so in particular suppose that
1698030~003970~I had a signal which I modulated with a pulse train
1702000~005230~and I i chose another signal modulated with another poll strain
1707230~005250~where the time slot was different and I continue this process
1712480~004590~and after the after i'd done this with some number of channels
1717070~004000~simply and it all those together
1721070~006120~as i indicate here then as long as I knew what time slots to associate with
1727190~001050~what signal
1728240~003540~I could get the original a
1731780~003140~modulated signals back again
1734920~003020~and then as long as the frequency 0
1737940~003790~the impulse train was such that
1741730~003140~I was able to do this reconstruction
1744870~003120~by simply low-pass filtering then
1747990~004390~I would be able to be my Julie so it's a very different very important modulation
1752380~001650~scheme call time division
1754030~005100~multiplexing in contrast to frequency division multiplexing as we talked about
1759130~001600~last time
1760730~004990~I made reference earlier the concept of Trance multiplexing and in fact
1765720~003740~what happens in many communication systems
1769460~003960~is dead the signals are represented in fact
1773420~003930~in discrete-time the analog continues time signals are represented in
1777350~001120~discrete-time
1778470~003030~and very often the conversion from
1781500~004030~frequency division multiplexing to time division multiplexing and back
1785530~004600~is done in fact in the discrete-time to me
1790130~004530~okay so what we have then
1794660~003110~is the notion
1797770~004039~dead we can
1801809~004231~multiply a time function
1806040~004910~by a poll strain as i indicated here
1810950~004580~and from the output I can
1815530~004029~if the frequency this post rain is high enough in relation to this band with
1819559~003301~from the output which consists of both
1822860~003980~time slices from those times places
1826840~004450~I can recover the original signal
1831290~003440~stressing again the reason it relates
1834730~003050~to the spectra and
1837780~003430~the reason is dead the original spectra
1841210~003070~is simply replicated at
1844280~003420~multiples all the fundamental frequency
1847700~004220~upholstery
1851920~003090~now is a very important thing to observe here
1855010~005880~which is dead the ability to do the reconstruction
1860890~003230~is associated with the notion of whether we can extract that
1864120~003360~kinda central triangle light happened choose a triangular shape but
1867480~003660~obviously I could be talking about any shape as long as it's been limited
1871140~003100~the ability to extract at and notice
1874240~004870~that in this modulated output spectrum
1879110~004180~the ability to recover this is totally independent
1883290~004500~all what the value of Delta is in other words
1887790~004170~if we look back at
1891960~003400~the modulator then
1895360~003630~in fact we can make Delta
1898990~003380~the with these pulses arbitrarily small
1902370~003140~and in theory that doesn't affect
1905510~004680~our ability to do the reconstruction now in practical terms it might
1910190~004390~looking back once more at the specter of the output
1914580~004000~noticed that this sample to is proportional to Delta
1918580~003420~and what that suggests is that as we make
1922000~003070~Delta smaller and smaller which we
1925070~003440~might in fact want to do if you want to time division multiplexed last two
1928510~001720~channels
1930230~002900~in principle in theory you could make it an infinite number channels just by
1933130~002030~making an infinitesimally small
1935160~005980~the smaller it is in some sense the less energy there is and again
1941140~003620~in practical terms this one of those things if you push down here pops up
1944760~000860~there
1945620~004870~namely you eventually run into issues such as noise problems
1950490~003310~so more more typically what's done is
1953800~004600~to in fact eliminate the scale factor a delta
1958400~004180~and the way that that's done is very simply
1962580~003670~it's done by choosing
1966250~004490~the with I love the pulses
1970740~003819~and the height %uh the pulses in such a way
1974559~003931~dead the area is constant even as
1978490~004110~we make Delta get arbitrarily small so
1982600~004090~and we can just modify our argument
1986690~005200~so that what we're referring to is a modulating post rain
1991890~003210~which is a pulse train with positive with Delta
1995100~004940~and height one over Delta in that case
2000040~003389~as Delta gets arbitrarily small
2003429~003951~then in fact what these rectangles become
2007380~004330~are impulses in which case what we're talking about
2011710~003450~is a carrier signal
2015160~004130~which in fact is an impulse train
2019290~003490~and the resulting modulated signal
2022780~003950~is and imposed strain for which the amplitudes
2026730~003910~of the impulses are proportional to
2030640~003480~the original input waveform at
2034120~004920~the times at which these impulses occur
2039040~004480~okay well let's look at the analysis a bat
2043520~003409~and so now what we're talking about
2046929~003291~is a spectrum
2050220~004810~dead up
2055030~003510~consists all the result
2058540~005450~love the spectrum we talked about before the sin x over X envelope except
2063990~003280~that now is Delta goes to zero that becomes
2067270~004720~flat in other words the modulating signal is an impulse train
2071990~003439~and so as we look at the spectrum
2075429~003111~the modulating signal that is then
2078540~003379~and impose train in the frequency domain the high
2081919~003710~is proportional to the frequency
2085629~003680~up the impulse train and Omega the best now denotes
2089309~003830~the frequency the impulse train and
2093139~004271~the resulting output the modulator
2097410~003129~has a spectrum which is
2100539~004520~this original spectrum again replicated around
2105059~004571~each love these impulses in other words replicated in multiples
2109630~003850~or the sampling frequency now
2113480~005259~this is very much identical to the more general case we have
2118739~003080~this replication the spectra
2121819~003680~and as long as
2125499~004260~this sample the the frequency of the impulse train is
2129759~003881~large enough compared with the band with the signal
2133640~003310~so that these triangles don't overlap
2136950~003700~I can extract this
2140650~003080~portion of the spectrum by low-pass filtering
2143730~003500~which in fact with then give us back
2147230~003200~the original signal now
2150430~003760~if instead this frequency Omega sed am
2154190~004149~is greater than Omega best minus Omega sed am
2158339~003791~we would have a spectrum that looked
2162130~003080~something more like this and what's happened
2165210~003029~in this case is that because
2168239~004171~we have an overlap here we've destroyed the ability
2172410~004020~to recover the original signal from the impulse train
2176430~003609~and that would be true also in general in a more general case
2180039~003240~love pulse amplitude modulation with
2183279~003510~pulses that up 90 with
2186789~004431~this effect by the way is one that will be
2191220~004589~exploring in considerably more detail in the next lecture and
2195809~003680~it's a phenomenon or distortion referred to as a leasing which
2199489~003090~in fact is important and interesting topic but
2202579~004301~going back to the case in which we've chosen the frequency of the upholstery
2206880~002270~in high enough
2209150~004750~then we would recover the original signal
2213900~003000~by processing it through
2216900~003139~a low-pass filter
2220039~003800~and in in that case
2223839~004420~what this says is dead if we have a signal
2228259~004090~and we modulated with an impulse train
2232349~005420~if we then process that impulse train through an ideal ok pass filter
2237769~004520~given the right conditions on Sat on the frequency the impulse train and the band
2242289~001181~with the signal
2243470~003559~we can recover the original signal back again
2247029~004300~now let me stress just going back to
2251329~004151~the picture in which we have done this modulation
2255480~003519~that this process where the modulation
2258999~003820~where the carrier signal involves an impulse train is
2262819~003480~often referred to as sampling and
2266299~003700~what that mean specifically is dead
2269999~005171~if we notice this resulting in polls train
2275170~003280~is in fact a sequence
2278450~003450~all samples all
2281900~003339~the original continuous-time signal in other words
2285239~005711~what we've done in effect is taken instantaneous samples at this way form
2290950~003030~and the implication is that if we do that
2293980~003250~at a rapid and afraid in relation
2297230~003950~to the band with the signal then
2301180~004079~we can in fact recover the original signal back again
2305259~003320~and finally to remind you
2308579~003220~I'll the argument once more
2311799~003190~we have an original signal
2314989~005820~and we have its spectrum when we've sampled it and this is now the sampled
2320809~004131~signal it's an impulse train whose instantaneous values
2324940~004889~are samples at the original waveform the spectrum a bad
2329829~004000~is the original one replicated
2333829~003341~and when that is processed through a
2337170~004760~low-pass filter to extract this part of the spectrum
2341930~003629~then after the low-pass filter we can
2345559~005790~recover the original signal back again
2351349~003381~okay well in fact me although
2354730~003069~a if you kinda follow through
2357799~003641~the specter and the waveforms this all seems fairly
2361440~003260~straightforward and perhaps
2364700~003589~or perhaps not obvious
2368289~003790~it's really worth reflecting on how amazing
2372079~004760~the result really is what it says we begin this discussion
2376839~005141~by talking about modulation and in fact modulation and sinusoidal modulation is
2381980~002440~important in its own right
2384420~003460~we ended the discussion by talking
2387880~004010~about first pulse amplitude modulation
2391890~005419~and then showing how under the right set of conditions
2397309~004010~you can in fact take away form and
2401319~004210~sample it with a set of instantaneous samples
2405529~003101~and that said instantaneous samples in fact
2408630~005760~are sufficient totally represent and reconstruct the signal
2414390~003649~what in fact the formal statement that is
2418039~004010~is referred to as the sampling theorem
2422049~003131~very powerful their own that says
2425180~005099~if were given equally spaced samples over time function
2430279~005381~and if that time function is band limited
2435660~003800~and if the band with
2439460~004789~or is or if this if this sampling frequency is
2444249~003870~chosen in the right way in relation
2448119~003130~to the
2451249~004070~band with then in fact
2455319~003040~the original time function is
2458359~006791~uniquely recoverable with a low-pass filter
2465150~003179~now the sampling theorem is kinda
2468329~004391~I would say a watershed a cornerstone
2472720~003279~love a lot of the discussion we've been having
2475999~004540~for a whole variety of reasons if first of all crops out almost as kind as
2480539~004131~straightforward obvious statement but more importantly
2484670~003520~what it says is dead
2488190~005220~if I have a continuous-time signal which satisfies the right-center conditions
2493410~003550~I can represent it by what it does
2496960~004359~at sampling instance or acquittal only at discrete
2501319~003601~is this a time
2504920~003069~now what that leads to
2507989~003171~is a whole host of things wanna which
2511160~004339~is the statement that says if we have a continuous-time signal
2515499~003141~I could in fact represented
2518640~003609~as a discrete-time signal and I could even think
2522249~003891~love processing a continuous-time signal
2526140~003349~using discrete time concepts
2529489~003330~and when I'm all done converting back through
2532819~002970~the power the sampling theorem converting back to a continuous-time
2535789~001091~sick
2536880~003340~so the sampling theorem provides this
2540220~003339~with a very major important bridge between
2543559~005361~continuous-time and discrete-time implementations and ideas
2548920~005199~in the next several lectures we will be exploring so this in considerable detail
2554119~003301~first the focus in more next time
2557420~005300~on some with the specific issues and distortions associated with sampling and
2562720~001289~following that
2564009~004461~a discussion are what is referred to as
2568470~003930~discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals
2572400~000260~thank you
