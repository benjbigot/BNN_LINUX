041180~007000~the No
049900~007000~for last time
057040~005440~we began to address the issue a building continuous-time signals out a linear
062480~002440~combination of complex exponentials
064920~003850~and for the class a periodic signals
068770~004430~specifically what this led to was the Fourier series representation
073200~003250~for periodic signals let me just summarize
076450~003400~the result that we develop last time for
079850~003409~periodic signals we had the continuous-time for you
083259~003421~for a series where we built
086680~003890~the periodic signal I dove a linear combination
090570~003799~love harmonically related complex exponentials
094369~004351~and what that led to was what we refer to as
098720~003840~the synthesis equation and we
102560~004059~briefly address the issue love when this in fact bills
106619~004961~when this in fact is a complete representation at the periodic signal
111580~004240~and in essence what we presented was
115820~003549~conditions either Forex city being square integrable
119369~003000~or X-eighty being absolutely inevitable
122369~003570~then the other cited the for a series
125939~004050~is what I refer to as the analysis equation
129989~003941~and the analysis equation was the equation the told us how
133930~003309~we yet the forty a series coefficients
137239~003741~from x50 and so this equation
140980~003289~together with the synthesis equation represent
144269~003681~the forty a series description for periodic signals
147950~003550~now we'd like to do is
151500~004000~extend this idea to provide a mechanism
155500~005070~for building not periodic signals also I have a linear combination
160570~003150~complex exponentials and the
163720~003489~basic idea behind doing this is very simple
167209~004340~and also very clever as i indicated last time essentially
171549~005601~the thought is the following if we have a non periodic signal or a periodic
177150~000690~signal
177840~004090~we can think love constructing a periodic signal
181930~003959~by simply periodically replicating
185889~003011~that a periodic signal so
188900~003320~for example if I have in a periodic signal
192220~003810~as i've indicated here I can consider
196030~003329~building a periodic signal where
199359~003211~I simply take this original signal
202570~004099~and repeated at multiples love some period t0
206669~004171~now two things to recognize about this one
210840~003190~is that the periodic signal
214030~003450~is equal to the a periodic signal
217480~005039~over one period and the second is that as the period
222519~003171~goes to infinity then in fact
225690~004329~the periodic signal goes to
230019~003171~the a periodic signal so
233190~003570~the basic idea then is
236760~003560~to use the free a series to represent
240320~004870~the periodic signal and then examine the 4e a serious expression
245190~004180~as we let the period go to infinity well
249370~003869~let's quickly see how this develops
253239~003361~interns up the Associated equations here
256600~003340~again we have the periodic
259940~004910~signal and what we want to inquire
264850~004300~into is what happens to the forty a serious expression for this
269150~003850~as we let the period go to infinity as that happens
273000~003100~whatever for a series representation we end up with
276100~005530~will correspond also to a representation for this a periodic signal
281630~004210~well let's see the forty a series
285840~004380~synthesis expressions for the periodic signal expresses
290220~004729~extol dirty the periodic signal as a linear combination
294949~003440~of harmonically related complex exponentials
298389~003090~with the fundamental frequency Omega 0
301479~003761~equal to 25 divided by the period and
305240~003500~the analysis equation tells us
308740~004610~what the relationship is for the coefficients
313350~004640~interns are the periodic signal now I indicated
317990~003460~that the periodic signal and the a periodic signal
321450~003150~are equal over one period we recognize
324600~004860~that this integration in fact only occurs over one period
329460~003120~and so we can really express this interns
332580~004760~all our original a periodic signal so this tells us the for a series
337340~001230~coefficients
338570~004189~interns affect safety
342759~003011~okay now
345770~005110~if in we look at this expression which is the expression for the 4e
350880~005100~coefficients the a periodic signal one other things to recognize
355980~003260~is dead in effect what
359240~003580~this represents are samples
362820~003610~all an integral where
366430~003020~we can think all the variable Omega
369450~004210~taking on values better integer multiples
373660~005580~Omega 0 said another way let's define a function as i've indicated here
379240~003000~which is this in a brawl where
382240~004170~and we may think it will make a as being a continuous variable
386410~003780~and then the forty a series coefficients correspond
390190~003580~to substituting Omega
393770~003270~is for Omega K
397040~006340~Omega 0 now one reason for doing that as we'll see is that in fact
403380~003830~this will turn out to provide us with the mechanism
407210~003660~for forty-a representation affect safety
410870~003320~and this in fact and is an on below
414190~003170~all the four EA series coefficients
417360~005240~in other words t0 the period times the coefficients
422600~004360~is equal so this integral at integer multiples
426960~003050~Omega 0
430010~005080~okay so this effect tells us how to get the for a series coefficients the
435090~001290~periodic signal
436380~005760~interns love samples of an envelope and that will become a very important notion
442140~003010~shortly and in
445150~004090~that in effect will correspond to an analysis equation
449240~006519~to represent the a periodic signal now let's look at the synthesis equation
455759~003890~group call that in the synthesis our strategy is
459649~003560~to build a periodic signal and let the period go to infinite
463209~003880~well here is the expression
467089~004370~for the synthesis the periodic signal
471459~003310~now expressed interns
474769~003110~I'll samples of this envelope function
477879~005180~and where I've simply use the fact that the substitution
483059~005241~that t0 is to pile for Omega 0 and so I have an Omega 0 here
488300~004319~and a 1-over to pie and the reason for doing that
492619~004280~as we'll see in a minute is that this then turns into an integral
496899~003630~specifically then the synthesis equation
500529~003350~that we have is
503879~004520~what i've indicated here we would now want to examine this
508399~004170~as the period goes to infinity which means that
512569~003030~Omega 0 becomes infinitesimally small
515599~003290~and without dwelling on the details
518889~003911~and with my suggesting that you give this a fair amount of reflection
522800~004519~in fact what happens as the period goes to infinity
527319~004401~is that this some Asian approach is an integral
531720~004289~over Omega where Omega 0 becomes the differential
536009~003300~and Omega and the periodic signal of course
539309~004150~approaches the a periodic sick so
543459~003711~the resulting equation that we get outta
547170~003359~the original for a series synthesis equation
550529~003821~is the equation
554350~003529~that I indicate down here X if T
557879~003851~synthesized interns all this
561730~003609~integral which is what the forty a series approaches
565339~004180~as Omega 0 goes to zero and
569519~003110~we had previously that XO maker
572629~003781~was in fact an envelope function
576410~005359~and we have then the corresponding for EA transform analysis equation
581769~004380~which tells us how we arrive at that envelope
586149~004410~interns love accept T okay so
590559~003220~we now have and analysis equation and
593779~004091~synthesis equation which in effect expresses 4s
597870~003250~how to build XFT interns or
601120~004309~if into tears and we finally space complex exponentials
605429~003611~the strategy to review it
609040~003080~and which I'd like to illustrate with
612120~004139~a succession of overlays was
616259~003770~to begin up
620029~003990~with are a periodic signal as
624019~003421~I indicate here
627440~006720~and then reconstructed from that a periodic signal
634160~004070~and in this periodic signal has a forty a series
638230~004480~and we express the for a series coefficients if this
642710~003620~as samples all an envelope function
646330~004350~the envelope function is what I indicate on the curve below
650680~004250~so this is the envelope above the 40 a series coefficients
654930~004940~for example if the period t0
659870~004310~was four times t1 in the 4a series coefficients
664180~003200~that we would end up with is this set
667380~003430~samples of the and below if
670810~003140~instead we double that period
673950~004150~then the Fourier series coefficients that we end up with
678100~003100~are more finally space
681200~003740~and as t0
684940~003370~continues to increase we get more and more
688310~003950~finally space samples love this envelope function
692260~003510~and as t0 goes to infinity in fact what we get
695770~004300~is every single point on the envelope and that provides is
700070~003020~with the representation for
703090~003100~the a periodic sick let me just to
706190~003510~really emphasize the point
709700~003600~show this example once again but now
713300~003540~let's look at it dynamically on the computer display
716840~003930~so here we have the square wave in below it
720770~003970~the for a series coefficients we now want to look at the for a series
724740~001070~coefficients
725810~007000~as the period at the square wave starts to increase
737770~002920~and what we see is that these look
740690~003090~like samples love an envelope
743780~004140~and in fact the envelope for the Fourier series coefficients
747920~004090~is shown in the bottom trace and emphasize in fact that it is the
752010~000800~envelope
752810~004850~let's superimpose it on top of the Fourier series coefficients that we've
757660~007000~generated so far
768360~003190~okay now let's increase the period
771550~003810~even further and we'll see the for a series
775360~003060~coefficients billion under that
778420~005680~envelope function even more and in fact
784100~003850~as the period gets large enough what we
787950~003010~begin to get a sense love is
790960~003720~that we're sampling more and more finally
794680~005160~this and below and in fact in the limit as the period goes off to infinity
799840~003320~the samples basically will represent every
803160~004650~single point on the envelope well this is about as far as you want to go
807810~004090~let's once again plot the envelope function
811900~004020~and again to emphasize that we've generated samples a bad
815920~007000~let superimpose that on the forty a series coefficients
825940~002930~okay so what we have then is
828870~003090~now are forty-a transform
831960~004260~representation the continuous time Fourier transform
836220~003540~with the synthesis equation
839760~003350~expressed as an integral as they've indicated here
843110~003090~and this integral is what
846200~003100~the four th series some went to
849300~003410~as we let the period go to infinity
852710~003150~where the frequency go to zero the corresponding
855860~004580~analysis equation which we have here the analysis equation
860440~004050~being the expression for the on below
864490~003460~up to 40 a series coefficients for the periodically
867950~004680~replicated signal and in shorthand notation
872630~002259~we would think affects if T
874889~003140~and its Fourier transform as a pair
878029~004941~as i've indicated here and the Fourier transform
882970~004690~as will emphasize in several examples and certainly
887660~003729~as is consistent with the forty a series is
891389~005151~a complex value function even when accepting israel's so would accept the
896540~000690~real
897230~004180~we end up with the 48 transform which is a complex function
901410~003899~just as the for you series coefficients were complex
905309~002941~for real value time function
908250~003790~so we could alternatively as with the 4e a series
912040~003910~express the Fourier transform it turns
915950~003400~love its real part an imaginary part
919350~003260~or alternatively interns
922610~005640~love its magnet to and its angle
928250~003390~all right now let's look at an example
931640~003440~love a time function and its Fourier transform
935080~003069~and so let's consider
938149~003481~an example which in fact is an example worked out in the tax that's
941630~004910~example 4.7 tax and missus are all familiar friend
946540~002969~the exponential
949509~004770~its Fourier transform is the integral from minus infinity plus infinity X
954279~000701~thirty
954980~003639~either the minus J Omega TDT and
958619~003921~so if we substitute in exit to the and
962540~005180~combine these two exponentials together these two exponentials
967720~003459~combined are he to the minus the
971179~004450~times a-plus jail mega and
975629~003270~if we carry out the integration
978899~003170~love this we end up with the expression
982069~003100~indicated here and provided
985169~003431~now in this is important provided
988600~003579~that a is greater than 0
992179~003840~and at the upper limit this exponential become 0
996019~003780~at the lower limit of course it's one and so
999799~003470~what we have finally is the for the
1003269~004130~Fourier transform expression one over a plus
1007399~004621~jail make
1012020~004040~okay now this Fourier transform as i indicated
1016060~003290~is a complex valued function let's just
1019350~003340~take a look at what it looks like graphically
1022690~003569~we have
1026259~004170~the expression the Fourier transform pair
1030429~004580~either the minus eighty times a step and its forty-eight transformers one over
1035009~003130~a place J Omega and I indicated
1038139~003471~dead that's true for a greater than 0
1041610~004309~now in the expression that we just worked out
1045919~004171~if a is less than 0 in fact the
1050090~003289~the expression doesn't converge the
1053379~004071~to the -84 a negative
1057450~003490~as he goes to infinity blows up
1060940~004459~and so in fact the 48 transform doesn't converge
1065399~004181~in the case except for the case were a is greater than 0
1069580~004449~and in fact there's a more detailed discussion of convergence issues in the
1074029~000490~tax
1074519~003091~the convergence issues are very much the same
1077610~004069~the Fourier transform as they are for the four th series in fact that's not
1081679~001421~surprising because
1083100~003059~we develop the Fourier transform out of consideration
1086159~004770~for you series so the convergence conditions as you'll see as you refer a
1090929~000740~detailed
1091669~003390~tax relate to whether the time function is
1095059~003051~absolutely integral under one set of conditions
1098110~004180~and square integrable under another set of conditions
1102290~005089~okay now if we plot the Fourier transform
1107379~003500~let's first consider the shape at the time function
1110879~003481~and as i indicated way restricting the time function
1114360~005199~so that the exponential factor is positive in other words you the -80
1119559~004460~detainees as he goes to infinity the magnitude
1124019~003201~or the for EA transform
1127220~003289~is as i indicate here and
1130509~004081~the phase below it and
1134590~003329~think there are a number of things that we can see about
1137919~003110~the magnitude and phase
1141029~004161~the 48 transform for this example which in fact we'll see
1145190~004910~in the next lecture are properties that apply more generally
1150100~004699~for example the fact that the 48 transform magnitude is an even function
1154799~005051~frequency and the phase is an odd function of frequency
1159850~003709~now let me also draw your attention
1163559~005031~so the fact there'd on this curve we have
1168590~003880~both positive frequencies and negative frequencies
1172470~004549~in other words in our expression for the 48 transform
1177019~004000~we've it requires both or make a positive
1181019~005500~and Omega negative this of course was exactly the same in the case
1186519~003931~the for a series and the reason you should
1190450~005640~recalling keep in mind is related to the fact that we're building our signals
1196090~003790~out of complex exponentials which require both
1199880~005269~positive values have Omega and negative values Omega alternatively if we chose
1205149~004301~another representation which turns and occasionally to be much more difficult
1209450~003209~namely sines and cosines that we would in fact
1212659~003671~only consider positive frequencies so it's important to keep in mind
1216330~005319~that in our case both with the for a series in the 48 transform
1221649~004421~we deal and require both positive and negative frequencies
1226070~003830~in order to build their signals
1229900~004860~now in the graphical representation that I shown here
1234760~003700~I've chosen a linear amplitude scale
1238460~003080~and a linear frequency scale and thats one
1241540~003570~graphical representation the Fourier transform
1245110~003460~that will typically use is another one
1248570~004240~that very commonly arises and
1252810~003790~which all just briefly indicate for this example
1256600~003830~and that is was referred to
1260430~003280~as a boat imply in which the
1263710~005220~magnet to is displayed on a large amplitude in like frequency scale
1268930~003010~in the phase is displayed on a lock frequency scale
1271940~003430~let me show you what I me here is
1275370~003500~the general expression for the boat reply body plot
1278870~004030~expresses 4s the amp with two interns
1282900~003000~the longer them to the base 10 the magnitude
1285900~004410~and it also expresses the angle in both cases
1290310~003880~express as as a function
1294190~004360~love a logarithmic speak with yes so
1298550~003120~here is the amplitude
1301670~004240~as i've displayed at and
1305910~003670~this is a log magnitude scale a logarithmic
1309580~003920~frequency scale as indicated by the fact that as we move
1313500~003710~include equal increments along this axis we change
1317210~003520~frequency by a factor 10 and
1320730~003210~similarly what we
1323940~003490~have is a display for the phase again
1327430~004150~on a light frequency scale and I indicated
1331580~004380~dead there is a symmetry to the Fourier transform
1335960~004280~and so in fact we can infer from this particular picture
1340240~004070~what it looks like to the negative frequencies as well as for the positive
1344310~004650~returns
1348960~004070~okay now
1353030~001619~what we've
1354649~003221~done so far is to develop
1357870~004480~the for EA transform on the basis
1362350~003840~the Fourier transform it a periodic signal on the basis
1366190~003349~periodically repeating it and recognizing
1369539~004350~that the for a series coefficients are samples of an envelope
1373889~003870~on an envelope and that these become more finally space
1377759~003010~as frequency increases and in fact
1380769~003140~we can go back to are
1383909~003181~original equation
1387090~003819~in which we developed an envelope function
1390909~003691~and what we had indicated
1394600~003110~is dead the 4e a series
1397710~003329~coefficients where samples of this envelope
1401039~004581~we then
1405620~003250~to find this envelope as
1408870~005510~the Fourier transform all this a periodic signal so
1414380~003980~that provided us with the way and it was a mechanism
1418360~005270~for getting a representation for a periodic sick
1423630~004420~now suppose that we have instead
1428050~003620~a periodic signal are there in fact
1431670~005430~some statements that we can make about how the Fourier series coefficients
1437100~005540~that are related to the Fourier transform of something well
1442640~003130~in fact this statement tells us
1445770~003100~exactly how to do that what this statement says
1448870~003700~is that in fact the forty a series coefficients
1452570~004760~our samples all the four EA transform
1457330~003910~up one period so if
1461240~003330~we now consider
1464570~004590~a periodic signal weekend in fact
1469160~004670~get before a series coefficients that periodic signal
1473830~003190~by considering the Fourier transform
1477020~005140~above one period said another way the 4e a series coefficients
1482160~004280~are proportional samples on the Fourier transform
1486440~003270~one period so if we consider this
1489710~004860~a periodic signal computer its Fourier transform
1494570~003420~and selected these
1497990~003560~samples that I indicate here
1501550~003280~namely samples equally spaced in omega
1504830~003050~in by multiples are integer multiples
1507880~003140~love Omega 0 then in fact
1511020~003180~those would be the story a series coefficients
1514200~003170~so we can go back to
1517370~003470~are example previously
1520840~003430~with that involved the
1524270~003580~square wave and now
1527850~003620~in this case we could argue that if in fact
1531470~003720~it was the periodic signal that we started with
1535190~003050~we could get the 40 series coefficients
1538240~003470~that by thinking about
1541710~003690~the four EA transform above one period
1545400~004870~which I indicate here and then
1550270~004370~the 48 series coefficients other periodic signal
1554640~003330~in fact are the appropriate set
1557970~006720~samples of this envelope
1564690~003390~alright now we have away
1568080~004340~love getting the for a series coefficients
1572420~003780~from the Fourier transform one period we originally derived
1576200~003800~the Fourier transform one period from the 48 series
1580000~003059~what would in fact be nice
1583059~003941~is if we could incorporate before a series
1587000~003059~in the Fourier transform within a common framework
1590059~003021~and in fact it turns out dead there
1593080~003390~is a very convenient way of doing that almost by definition
1596470~004000~essentially
1600470~003589~if we consider what the equation
1604059~004700~for the synthesis looks like in both cases we
1608759~004650~can in effect define of four EA transform
1613409~005130~for the periodic signal which we know is represented by its for a series
1618539~002041~coefficients we can define
1620580~005069~48 transform and the definition of the Fourier transform
1625649~006410~is as an impulse train where the coefficients in the impulse train
1632059~003551~are proportional with the proportionality factor
1635610~004899~25 for more less a bookkeeping reason proportional to the forty a series
1640509~000991~coefficients
1641500~003409~and the validity of this is
1644909~003441~more or less can be seen
1648350~003689~essentially by substitution specifically
1652039~003220~here is then the
1655259~003471~synthesis equation for the four EA transform
1658730~005789~if we substitute this definition for the four th chance for the periodic signal
1664519~005380~into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping
1669899~004130~and interchange the order some Asian and integration
1674029~003750~the in polls integrates out to
1677779~005461~the exponential factor that we want so
1683240~004779~we have the exponential factor we have the for a series coefficients
1688019~003841~the two pies take care of each other and what we're left with
1691860~003140~is the synthesis equation for
1695000~004539~a periodic signal in terms of the Fourier transform foreign it interns
1699539~004551~love it's for a series coefficients right now
1704090~003429~we can just see this interns
1707519~003360~love a simple example if we
1710879~004311~consider the example love a symmetric square wave
1715190~003420~then in effect what we're saying is that
1718610~004460~for this symmetric square wave this has
1723070~003959~set up for a series coefficients which we work that previously
1727029~003620~and which I indicate on this figure
1730649~003500~with a bar graph and really all that were saying
1734149~004311~is there whereas these free a series coefficients our index
1738460~006040~on an integer variable K and their bars not impulses
1744500~003269~if we simply redefine or define
1747769~004160~the Fourier transform love the periodic signal
1751929~005041~as an impulse train where the weights at the impulses
1756970~003140~are to Paul II times the
1760110~003449~correspondent for a series coefficients and
1763559~004031~this in fact is what we would use as the four EA
1767590~006079~transform love the periodic sick
1773669~003281~okay now we've kind of gone back and forth
1776950~003099~on and maybe even it might seem
1780049~003531~likely going around in circles so let me just
1783580~003300~try to summarize the various relationships
1786880~003409~and steps that we've gone through keeping in mind that
1790289~003091~one of our objectives was first to develop
1793380~004679~representation for a periodic signals and then attempt to
1798059~003801~incorporate within one framework both periodic
1801860~003679~in a periodic signals
1805539~003411~we began with
1808950~002290~and a periodic signal
1811240~003539~and the strategy was to develop
1814779~003870~for your representation by constructing
1818649~003931~periodic signal for which that was one period
1822580~003400~in and then we let the period go to infinity as
1825980~005770~I indicate here so we have and a periodic signal
1831750~003880~we construct a periodic signal
1835630~003009~extol dirty for which one period
1838639~006540~is the a periodic signal X still dirty the periodic signal has a forty a series
1845179~003451~and as its period increases
1848630~003860~that approaches the a periodic signal and
1852490~005520~the forty a series of that approaches the 48 transform
1858010~003360~all the original a periodic sick so
1861370~004320~that was the first step that we took
1865690~003290~now the second thing that we recognize is dead
1868980~004329~once we have the concept to the 48 transform
1873309~004771~we can in fact relate the Fourier series coefficients
1878080~003180~to the 48 transform one period
1881260~004650~so the second statement that we made was dead
1885910~006410~if in fact we're trying to represent a periodic signal
1892320~003030~we can get the 40 series coefficients have that
1895350~003440~by computing the for EA transform
1898790~003960~one period and then
1902750~003160~samples that for EA transform are
1905910~006940~in fact the 4e series coefficients for the periodic sick
1912850~003470~okay then the third step that we took was
1916320~005000~to inquire as to whether they're is a Fourier transform
1921320~003450~that can appropriately be defined for
1924770~003150~the periodic signal in the mechanism for doing that
1927920~005080~was to recognize that if we simply to find the Fourier transform
1933000~004720~the periodic signal as an impulse train where the in polls
1937720~004290~fights or areas for proportional to the for a series coefficients
1942010~003980~then in fact the Fourier transform
1945990~003540~synthesis equation reduced to
1949530~003880~before you see recent this equation so the third step
1953410~004200~then was with a periodic signal
1957610~003680~the 48 transform that periodic signal
1961290~004500~defined as an impulse train with the heights or areas the impulses are
1965790~003000~proportional to the forty a series coefficients
1968790~003590~provides us with the mechanism for
1972380~003100~combining together the concepts war
1975480~005860~notation love before you a series and Fourier transform so
1981340~004170~if we just took I E very simple example
1985510~003490~here is an example in which
1989000~003650~we have and a periodic signal
1992650~003420~which is just an impulse and its
1996070~003090~for EA transform is just a constant
1999160~003660~we can think other periodic signal
2002820~003720~associated with this which is this signal
2006540~004730~periodically replicated in with the spacing t0
2011270~004000~the Fourier transform love this is a constant
2015270~003330~and this of course has a forty a series representation
2018600~003480~so the Fourier transform or
2022080~005740~the original in polls is just a constant the Fourier transform
2027820~003190~love the periodic signal is
2031010~003240~an impulse train where the heights at the impulses
2034250~004070~are proportional to the forty a series coefficients
2038320~004260~and of course we could previously have computed
2042580~003610~the forty a series coefficients to that imposed strain
2046190~003900~and those for a series coefficients are as I've shown here
2050090~003049~so on both these cases these in effect
2053139~003901~represent just a change in notation we're here we have a bar graph in here
2057040~001520~we have been imposed strain
2058560~003369~and both at the is simply represent
2061929~003381~samples of what we have above
2065310~003210~which is the for EA transform
2068520~005700~love the original a periodic sick
2074220~003139~okay now once again I suspect that kinda
2077359~004810~moving back and forth and and trying to straighten out when we're talking about
2082169~002400~periodic in a periodic signals
2084569~003770~may require a little mental gymnastics initially
2088339~003320~basically what we try to do is
2091659~004500~incorporate within one framework representation for both
2096159~004430~a periodic and and periodic signals in the Fourier transform
2100589~003831~provides us with a mechanism to do that
2104420~003230~in the next lecture I'll continue with the discussion
2107650~004530~or the continuous-time for EA transform in particular focusing
2112180~004250~on a number of its properties summer which we've already seen namely the
2116430~001350~symmetry properties
2117780~003410~we'll see lots of other properties that relate
2121190~003720~of course both to the 48 transform and to the for users
2124910~000290~thank you
