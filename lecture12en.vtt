the norm

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
are the in discussing the

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms we

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
developed a number of important properties

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to particularly sitting significant ones as I mention

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
at the time are the modulation property and the convolution property

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
starting with the next lecture the one after this one

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
will be developing and exploiting some other consequences

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the modulation property in today's lecture though I'd like to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
review and expand on the notion of filtering

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which as I had mentioned flows more less directly from

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the convolution property to begin let me just quickly review

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
what the convolution property is both for continuous-time

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and for discrete-time the convolution property tells us

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that the 48 transform

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
all the convolution up to time functions

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is the product up to 48 transforms

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
now what this means

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
in terms love linear time-invariant filters

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
since we know that the in the time domain the output of a linear

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
time-invariant filter is the convolution

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
love the input and the impulse response

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it says essentially then in the frequency domain

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that the forty a transformer the output is the product

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of the 48 transform of the impulse response

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
namely the frequency response and the Fourier transform

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
love the input so the output is described through that product

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
now recall also

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
bad in developing the four EA transform I interpreted

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the Fourier transform as the complex amplitude

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
over decomposition of the signal interns have a set of complex exponentials

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and the frequency response for the convolution property

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in effect tells us what the amplitudes how to modify the amplitudes

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
avi to those complex exponentials as they go through the system

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
now this led to the notion of filtering

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
where the basic concept was that since we can modify

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the airport to %uh each of the exponential

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
complex exponential components separately weekend for example

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
retain some love them and totally eliminate others

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and this is the basic notion of filtering so

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we have as you recall first evolved the notion

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
in continuous-time all an ideal filter

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
for example I L a straight year an ideal

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
low-pass filter where we pass exactly

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
frequency comp phone it's in one band and reject

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
totally frequency comp ponents in another band

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the van being passed of course referred to as the passband

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and the ban rejected as the stopping I

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
illustrated here low pass filter we can of course

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
reject the low frequencies and retain

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the high frequencies and that then corresponds to

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ideal high pass filter or we can just retain frequencies within a band

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and so I show below what is referred to commonly as

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
a bandpass filter now

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
this is what the ideal filters look like

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
for continuous-time for discrete-time we have exactly

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the same situation namely we have

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
an ideal discrete-time low-pass filter which

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
passes exactly frequencies which are the low frequencies

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
low frequencies of course being around zero and because the periodicity also

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
around 2pi

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
we show also an ideal

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
high pass filter and a high pass filter

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
as i indicated last time passes frequencies around pie

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and finally below that I show an ideal

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
bandpass filter a an ideal bandpass filter passing frequencies

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
someplace in the range between 0 and pie

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and recall also bat the basic difference between

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
continuous-time and discrete-time for these filters is that

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the discrete-time versions are of course periodic

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in frequency now let's look at

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
these ideal filters and in particular the idea low-pass filter

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in the time domain we have

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the frequency response 0 the idea low-pass filter

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and shown below it is the impulse response so here is the frequency

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
response

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and below it the impulse response

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
love the ideal low-pass filter

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and this of course is a sin x over X

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
for with impulse response and recognize also

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
or recall that since this frequency response

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is real value

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the impulse response in other words the inverse transform

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is an even function of time and

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
notice also since I want to refer back to this

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that the impulse response to an ideal Lopez filter

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
in fact is non causal that follows from Long other things from the fact that

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it's an even function

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but keep in mind in fact that sin x over its function

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
goes off to infinity in both directions so

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the impulse response to the idea low-pass filter

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is symmetric and continues to have tales of the plus and minus infinity

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
now the situation is basically the same

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in the discrete-time case

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
let's look at the frequency response and associated impulse response

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
for an ideal discrete-time low-pass filter

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
so once again here is the

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
frequency response love the idea low-pass filter

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and below it I show the impulse response

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
again its a sin x over x-type impulse response

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and again we recognize

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that sits in the frequency domain this frequency response

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is real bad that means as a consequence

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
of the properties love the forty a transforming inverse Fourier transform

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that the impulse response is an even function

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in the time domain and also incidently

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the sin x over expulsion goes off to infinity

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
again in both directions

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
now we talked about i do. filters

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in this discussion and ideal filters are

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
in fact ideal in a certain sense what they do ideally

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is they pass a certain band of frequencies exactly

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and they reject a band of frequencies exactly

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
on the other hand there are many filtering problems in which

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
generally we don't have a sharp distinction between the frequencies we

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
want to

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
passed in the frequencies you wanna 12 reject

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
one example if this that's elaborated on in the tax is

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the design of an automotive suspension system which in fact

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is the design all a low-pass filter

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and basically what you want to do in a case like that

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is filter out or attenuate

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
very rapid Road variations and keep

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the lower variations in of course elevation of the highway

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
or or road and what you can see

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
intuitively is dead and there isn't really a very sharp

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
distinction a sharp cutoff between what you would like to recall

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the low frequencies and what you would call the high frequencies

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
now also somewhat related to this is the fact dead

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the as we've seen in the time domain is ideal filters have

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
very particular kind of character for example let's look back

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
at the ideal low-pass filter and

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we saw this the impulse response

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the impulse response is what we've shown here let's now look

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
at the step response love the discrete-time

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
ideal low-pass filter and noticed the fact that it has a tail that oscillates

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and when this step its in fact it has oscillatory behavior

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
now exactly the same situation occurs

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
in continuous-time let's look at the

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
step response love the continuous-time

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ideal ok pass filter and

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
what we see is that when a step its

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
then in fact we get and isolation

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and very often that isolation

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is something this undesirable for example if you're designing

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
an automotive suspension system and you hit a curve which is

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
step input in fact you probably would not like

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to have the automobile oscillating sort

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
sort dying down in in isolation

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
now is another very important point which again

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
we can see there in continuous-time and discrete-time

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
which is that even if we wanted to have

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
an ideal filter the ideal filter has another problem

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
if we want to attempt to implemented in real time

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
what's the problem the problem is

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
that since the impulse responses even and in fact

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
has details that go of the plus and minus infinity

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
its non causal so if in fact

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we want to build a filter and the filter is restricted operate in real time

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
than in fact we can't build

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
an ideal filter so

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
what that says is that in practice although i do. filters

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
are nice to think about and perhaps relate to practical problems

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
more typically what we consider

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
are non-ideal filters and

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in the discrete-time case non-ideal filter

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
then would have a characteristic somewhat

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
like i've indicated here where instead o

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
a very rapid transition from passband to stop and

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
there would be more gradual transition

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
with a passband cutoff frequency and

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a stop and cutoff frequency

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and perhaps also instead of having exactly

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
flat characteristic in the stop band and in the past and

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we would allow a certain amount a ripple

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
we also have exactly the same situation

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
in continuous-time we're here will just simply change your frequency axis

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to a continuous frequency axis instead of the discrete frequency axes

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
again we would think in terms of I'm allowable passband ripple

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
a transition from stop and from passband to stop and

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
with a passband cutoff frequency and a stop and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
cutoff frequency so

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
kind of the notion here is dead again i do. filters are ideal in some respects

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
not ideal in other respects and for many

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
practical problems we may not want them and even if we did want them

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
we may not be able to get them perhaps because at this issue of causality

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
even if causality is not an issue what happens

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
in filter design and implementation in fact

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
is dead the sharper you attempt to make the cut off

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the more expensive in some sense the filter becomes

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
either in terms of comp phone-ins in continuous-time

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
or in terms of computation in discrete-time

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and so their are these whole variety of issues

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that really make it important to

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
understand the notion love non-ideal

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
filters now just two

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
illustrate as an example let me remind you

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
love one kinda bad example love what in fact is a non-ideal

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
low-pass filter and we have look previously

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
at The Associated differential equation

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
let me now in fact related to a circuit

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and in particular an RC circuit

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
where the output could either be across the capacitor

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
or the output can be across the resistor so

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
effect we have two systems here we have a system

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
which is the system function from the voltage source input to the capacitor

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
output

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the system from the both source input

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
to the resistor output and in fact

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
just up like your cause both its law to this we can relate those in a very

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
straightforward way

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's very straight forward to verify that

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the system from input to resist their output

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is simply the identity system with

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the capacitor output subtracted from

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
now we can write the differential equation

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
for either the system's and as we talked about last time

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in the last several lectures solve that equation using

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the exploiting the properties at a4e a transform

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and in fact we if we look at the differential equation

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
relating the capacitor output to

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the voltage source input we recognize that this is an example

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that in effect we saw previously and so

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
just working our way down applying the 48 transport to the differential

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
equation

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
voltage

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
or its Fourier transform to the Fourier transform the source

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
we then have the system function Associated

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
or if we solve instead for the system function

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
associated with the resistor output

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
we can simply subtract h1 from unity

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and the system function that we get in that case is the system function

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that I show here so we have

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
now to system functions one for the capacitor output

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the other for the resistor output and

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
one the first corresponding to the capacitor output

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in fact if we plotted on a linear ramp up to scale

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
looks like this and as you can see and as we saw last time

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
is an approximation to a low pass filter

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
it is in fact and non-ideal ok pass filter

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
whereas the resistor output is

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
an approximation to a high pass filter

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
or in effect and non-ideal high pass filter

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
so in one case just comparing the two we have

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
a low-pass filter as the capacitor output associate with the capacitor

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
output

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and a high pass filter Associated with the

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
resistor out let's just quickly

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
look at that example now looking on a boat reply

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
instead o on the linear scale that we showed before

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and recall incidently a and

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
be aware incident leave the fact that week and of course cascade

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
several filters if this type and approve the characteristics

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
so I have shown at the top

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
a bodie plot or the

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
capacitors system functions associated with the capacitor output it's flat out

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to a frequency corresponding 21

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
over the time constant RC

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and then it falls off at 10 DB

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
per decade a decade being a factor 10

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
or if instead we looked at the system function associated with the resistor

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
output that corresponds to a

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
10 dB per decade increase in frequency

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
up to approximately the reciprocal at the time constant and

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
then approaching a flat characteristic after that

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and if we consider either one of these

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
looking back again at the low-pass

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
filter if we were to cascade several filters

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
with this frequency response then because we have things plotted on a boat

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
reply

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
the body plot for the Cascade would simply be summing these and so

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
if we castigated for example two stages

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
is that a role of at 10 dB per decade it would

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
role of at 20 DB for decades

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
now filters that this type RC filters

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
perhaps several of them in cascade are

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
in fact very prevalent

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and in fact in a in a an environment

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
like this where where in fact doing recording

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
we see there there are

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
filters a fact I there show up very commonly both in the audio

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and the video poker portion or the signal processing this Associated

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
with making this set of tapes in fact

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
are let's take a look in the control room

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and what I'll be able to show you in the control room

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is the audio portion love

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the processing that's done and the kinds of filters very much of the type we just

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
talked about

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
their associated with signal processing this stunning

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
in preparing the audio the tapes so

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
let's just take a walk into the control room and see what we see

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
well this is the control room issues for camera switching its

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
use for computer editing and also audio control

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
you can see the monitors and these are used for the

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
camera switching and and this is the computer editing

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
console that use for online and offline computer editing

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but I really want to demonstrate though in a context to the lecture is the audio

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
control panel

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
which contains among other things a variety of filters for high frequency

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
low frequencies cetera basically equalization

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
filters and what we have in the way of filtering is

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
first of all a was referred to as a graphic equalizer

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
which consists of a set a bandpass filters which are described

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
little more carefully in a minute and then also

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and audio Control Panel which is down here

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and which contains separate equalizer circuits for each

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
over a whole set of channels and also lotsa controls on them

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
well let me begin in the demonstration by

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
demonstrating a little bit of what the graphic equalizer does

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
okay well what we have is a set a bandpass filters

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and what's indicated appear the center frequencies as the filters

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and then a slider switch reach 18 Lexus attenuator amplify

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and this is a DP scale so essentially

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
if you look across this banker filters

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
with the output olaf for the equalizer just being the summer the outputs from

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
you to these filters interestingly the position the slider switches as you move

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
across here

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in effect shows you what the frequency response to the equalizer is

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
so you can change the overall shaping I'll

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the filter by moving the switches up and down all right now the equalizer is

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
outlets

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
put the equaliser into the circuit and now I I put in this filtering

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
characteristic

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and what I'd like to demonstrate is filtering

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
with this when we do things that are a little more dramatic than what would

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
normally be done in a typical audio recordings setting

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and to do this let's add to my voice to music too

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
make it more interesting a not the my voice is an interesting as it is

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but in any case let's bring some music up

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and now what all do is

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
set the low frequencies flat and let me take out the high frequencies

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
above eight hundred cycle and

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
so now we have affectively is the low-pass filter it

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and now the low-pass filter let me know

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
bring the high is backup

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and so on bringing up those bandpass filters

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and now let me cut-out the lows

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and you'll hear the lows disappearing and in effect

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
keeping the highest affectively Crispin's

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the sound my voice music

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and finally let me go back 20db equalization I need to the filters

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and what also to now is

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
take the equalizer out at the circuit totally

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
now let's take a look at the audio Master Control Panel

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and this panel has of course

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
for each channel and for example channel that we're working on

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
a volume control I can turn the volume down

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and I can turn the volume up and

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
it also has a set for this particular equalizer circuit

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
it has a set love 3 bandpass filters

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and not switch lettuce either

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
put in up to 12 the be gain

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
or 12 DB attenuation in each of the bands

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and also a selector switch the lights is select the center the band

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
so let me Jess a again demonstrate a little bit with this and

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
let's get a closeup of this panel so what we have is i indicated

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
is 3 bandpass filters and these knobs that I'm pointing to hear

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
are controls that allow us to reach the filters to put in

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
up to 12 dB gain or 12 dB attenuation

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
there are also with the to the filters a selector switch

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
that lets us adjust the center frequency the filter basically it's a

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
to position switch they're also as you can see is

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
a button dead Lexus either put the equalization in or out

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
currently the equalization is out but put the equalization in

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
we won't be here any effect from that because the game controls are all set at

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
0db

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and I want to illustrate shortly the effective these but before I do let me

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
draw your attention

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to one other filter which is

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
this white switch and this this which

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
is a high pass filter that essentially

00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
cuts out frequencies below about a hundred cycle so what it means is that

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but put this which in everything is more or less flat above a hundred cycles

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and what that's used for basically is to eliminate

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
perhaps 60 cycle noise if that's present or some

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
low-frequency home or whatever well we won't

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
really demonstrate anything with that let so now with the equalization and

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
demonstrate the effect I'll

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
boosting or attenuating the low and high frequencies

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and again I think for to demonstrate this it's

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it illustrates the point the best if a if we have a little background music so

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
maestro if you can bring that up

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and so now I'm gonna do is first

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
whose the low frequencies and that's what this

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
potentiometer knob will do so now I'll

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
increasing the low-frequency game

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and in fact all the way up to 12 the be when I have the novel

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
was liza going here and so that has a very basic

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
sounding back

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
make it even base you're fighting

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
my sees and

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
attenuating knows by

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
well

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
okay well leads words some the high-frequency

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
back in

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in now let's turn the low-frequency

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
game offers back down

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
20 and now we're back to flat equalization

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and now I can turn the low-frequency game down

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so dead attenuate the low frequencies by as much as 12 the

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that's where we are now in service

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
force much first

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to enhance the highs even more hike in addition coming out who's the highs

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
by his

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
okay well let's turn down the music now and

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and go back to no equalization by setting these knives 20 dB in fact we

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
can take the equalizer out

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
well thats a quick look at some real-world filters

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
now let's the stop having so much fun and

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
let's go back to the lecture okay well

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
thats a little behind the scenes look but I'd

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
like to do now is turn our attention to

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
discrete-time filters and

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
as i've mentioned in previous lectures their are

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
basically two classes

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
love discrete-time filters or discrete time difference equations

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
one class is referred to

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
as a nonrecourse ive or moving average

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
filter and the basic idea

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
with the moving average filter is something that perhaps your

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
some what familiar with intuitively think I've the notion

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I love taking that data sequence and

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
let's suppose that what we wanted to do was apply a some smoothing to the data

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
sequence

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
we could for example think taking adjacent points

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
averaging them together and then moving that average

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
along the data sequence what you can kinda see intuitively

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
is that that would have apply some smoothing so in fact

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the difference equation let's say for a three-point moving average

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
would be the difference equation that I indicate here

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
just simply taking a data point

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and the two data points adjacent to it

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and forming an average over those three

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
so if we thought if the kinda processing involved

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
if performing an output sequence value

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
we would take three adjacent points an average though

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
that would give us the output at The Associated time

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and then to compute the next output point we were just simply slide this

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
by a one-point average these together and that would give us the next output

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
point and we would continue along

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
just simply sliding in averaging

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
to form the output data sequence now

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
that's an example love what's commonly referred to as a three-point moving

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
average

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
in fact we can generalize that notion

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
in a number of ways one-way generalizing

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the notion over moving average from the three-point moving average which I

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
summarize again here is to think or extending that

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
to a larger number of points and in fact

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
applying waits to that as i indicate here

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
so that in addition to just summing up the points and dividing by the number of

00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
points on

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
we can in fact apply individual weights to the points

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
so that its what is often referred to as awaiting

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
with moving average and I show

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
below one possible kind of curve

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that might result where these would-be

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
essentially the weights Associated with this waited

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
moving average and in fact its easy to verify

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
that this indeed corresponds to the impulse response

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
the filter well just two

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
cement this notion let me show you an example or two

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
here is an example all a

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
five-point moving average a five-point moving average

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
would have an impulse response dead

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
just consists of a rectangle Lovelinks 5

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and if this is convolved with the data sequence that would corresponding

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
correspond to taking five adjacent points and in effect averaging them

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we've looked previously at the quarry a transformer this rectangular sequence

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and the forty a transformer that in fact

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
is all the form of a sign an axe over

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
sin x kar and as you can see

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
that is so approximation to

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
a low-pass filter and so this again is

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
a the impulse response and frequency response

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
all a non-ideal low-pass filter

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
now there are a variety of both

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
algorithms that in fact tell you how to choose the weights

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
associated with the waiting weighted moving average

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to in some sense design better approximations

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and without going into the details love any of those algorithms

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
let me just show the results of choosing the weights

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
for the design over 250 first 251 points

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
moving average filter where the weights

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
are chosen using an optimum algorithm to generate a sharp a cut-off

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
as can possibly be generated and so what I show here

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
is the frequency response

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that the resulting filter on a logarithmic ample to scale

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
in a linear frequency scale noticed that on this scale the pass band is very flat

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
although here is an expanded you all that and in fact it

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
has was referred to as an equal ripple characteristic

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and then here's the transition band and here we have to stop and

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
which in fact is down somewhat more than 80 dB

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and again has what's referred to as an equal ripple characterised

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
now the notion of a moving average

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
for filtering is something dead is very commonly

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
use I a head shown last time actually the result

00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
some filtering on a particular data sequence the Dow Jones Industrial

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Average

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and very often in

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
looking at various kinds a stock market publications

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
what you will see is this the Dow Jones average

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
shown in its raw form as a data sequence and then very typically

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
you you'll see also: the result all

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
moving average where the moving average might

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
be on the order love days or it might be on the order

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
months the whole notion being to take

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
some other random high frequency fluctuations

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
out at the average and show the low-frequency

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
or trends over

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
some period of time so let's

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
in fact go back to the Dow Jones average and

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
let me now show you what the result of filtering

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
with a moving average filter would look like

00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
on the Seder same Dow Jones Industrial Average sequence that I showed last time

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
so once again we have the Dow Jones average from 1927 to roughly 1932

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
at the top we see the impulse response for the moving average

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
again I remind you on an expanded time scale

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and was shown here is the moving average with just one point

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
so the output on the bottom trace is

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
just simply identical to the input now let's increase the link to the moving

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
average 22 points and we see that there's a small amount of smoothing

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
three points and just a little more smoothing pickets inserted

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
now a four-point moving average

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and next the five-point moving average

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and a six-point moving average next we see that the smoothing increases

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
now let's increase the link to the moving average filter much more rapidly

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and watch how the output is

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
more and more smooth in relation to the input

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
again i emphasize that the timescale

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
for the impulse response is significantly expanded in relationship

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to the timescale for both the input in the output

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and once again through the magic of filtering we've been able to eliminate

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the 1929 stock market crash

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
alright so we've seen moving average filters

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and or what are sometimes referred to as

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
non workers is filters and

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
they are as I stressed very important class

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
discreet I filters another

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
very important class of discrete-time filters are

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
what are referred to as rehearses filters

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
workers the filters are filters that for which the difference equation

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
has feedback from the output back

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
into the input in other words the output

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
depends not only on the input but also on previous values if the output

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
so for example as i stress previously

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
a rikers a difference equation has

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
the general form that I indicate year

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
a linear combination love waited outputs on the left hand side and linear

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,000
combination

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
waited inputs on the right hand side and

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
as we talked about we can solve this equation

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
for the current output why I have an interns a

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
of current and past inputs and passed out

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
what's for example just two

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
interpret this focus on the interpretation of this is a filter

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
let's looking at a first-order difference equation which

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
we've talked about and generated the solution to previously

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
so the first-order a first 30 difference equation

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
would be as i indicated here

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and imposing causality on this

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
so that we assume that we are running this is a recursion forward in time

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
we can solve this for why I have an intern's affects it man

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and why I have and -1 waited

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
by the factor a and I simply indicate

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
the block diagram for this but what we want to examine now

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
for this first order recursion is the frequency response and see its

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
interpretation

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
as a filter well in fact again

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
the mathematics for this we've gone through in the last lecture

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and so interpreting the first-order difference equation as a system

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
we can what what we're attempting to

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
generate is the frequency response

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
which is the forty a transformer the impulse response

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and from the difference equation we can of course all

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties in

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
for EA transform applying to 48 transport to the difference equation

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
we will end up with the forty a transformer the output

00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
equal to the Fourier transform the input times this factor which

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
we know from the convolution property in fact

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
is the frequency response

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
of the system so this is the frequency response

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and of course the inverse Fourier transform a bad

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
which I E indicate below

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
is the system impulse response

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
so we have the frequency response obtained by

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
applying to free a transformed to the difference equation the impulse response

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and as we did last time we can

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
look at that interns love

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
a frequency response characteristic

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and recall that depending on whether

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
the factor A is positive or negative we need to get

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
a low-pass filter or a high pass filter

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and if in fact we look at the frequency response

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
for the factor a being positive then we see that this is an approximation

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to a low-pass filter who wears below it I showed the frequency response

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
for a negative & mare the

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
this corresponds to a way high pass filter because we're attenuating

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
low frequencies and retaining

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
the high frequencies in and

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
recall also that we illustrated

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
this this characteristic as a low-pass high-pass filter for the recursion

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
for the first-order recursion by by looking at

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
how it work as a filter in both cases

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
when the input was the Dow Jones average and indeed we saw that

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
it generated both low-pass and high-pass filtering

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
in in the appropriate cases so for discrete-time

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
we have the two classes moving average and

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
a cursive filters and

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and there are a variety of issues discussed in the text about why

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
in certain contexts one might want to use one or the other basically what

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
happens

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
is dead for the moving average filter

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
for a given set a filter specifications there are many more multiplications

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
required in for a cursive filter by

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
there are in certain contexts some very important compensating benefits

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
the moving average filter

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
now this concludes pretty much

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
what I A want to say in detail

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
about filtering the concept filtering in this set of lectures

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
this is only a very quick glimpse into

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a very important and very rich topic and one of course that

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
can be studied on its own in considerable amount of detail

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
as the lectures go online what will find

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
is that the basic concept to filtering both

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
ideal and non-ideal filtering will will

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
be a very important part love what we do

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and in in particular

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
beginning with the next lecture will turn to

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
a discussion of modulation exploiting

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
the property modulation as it relates to some practical problems

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and what will find when we do that is that

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
a very important part of that discussion and in fact the very important part

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
love the use of modulation also

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
just naturally incorporates the concept

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and properties filtering thank you
