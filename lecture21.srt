the new the

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,559 
last time we introduce the La Paz
transform

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,729 
as a generalization the Fourier
transform and just as a reminder

14
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,640 
the lacrosse transform expression as we
developed it

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,330 
is this integral very much

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,550 
similar to the Fourier transform
integral

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,720 
except with more general complex
variable and in fact we

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,090 
developed and talked about the
relationship between the apostrophe is

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,940 
forming a 48 transform

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,450 
in particular the apostrophe s form

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,560 
where the Posterous for variable ass

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,380 
purely imaginary in fact reduces

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,560 
to the 48 transform or

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,700 
more generally with the process for
variable as a complex number

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,850 
the a-plus transform is

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,240 
the Fourier transform love the
corresponding time

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,940 
function with an exponential weighting
and

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,080 
also as you should recall the

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,619 
exponential weighting introduce the
notion that

30
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,920 
the repost transform may converge for
some bad use

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,009 
Sigma and perhaps not for other values
Sigma

32
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,640 
so associated with the look lost
transform

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,190 
was what we refer to as the region of
convergence

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,099 
now just says

35
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,990 
with the Fourier transform there are a
number of properties

36
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,310 
the applause transform that are
extremely useful

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,680 
in describing and analyzing signals and
systems

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,709 
for example one other properties

39
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,040 
that we in fact took advantage out in
our discussion last time

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,750 
was the limit linearity property which
says

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,930 
in essence that they'll a-plus transform
love the linear combination

42
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,440 
up to time functions is the same

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,400 
linear combination love the associated
with boss transforms

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,750 
also there is a very important and
useful property which tells us

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,370 
how the derivative overtime function

46
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,130 
or rather the applause transformer the
derivative

47
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,830 
is related to the low-priced transform
in particular

48
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:21,440 
the a-plus transformer the derivative is
the apostrophe is for affective T

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,870 
multiplied by ass and as you can see by
just sending a sequel to jail maker

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,350 
in fact this reduces to the
corresponding Fourier transform property

51
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,630 
and

52
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,890 
a third property that in fact will make
frequent you so

53
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,110 
is referred to as the convolution
property

54
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,480 
again a generalization of the
convolution property for 48 transforms

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,760 
here the convolution property says that

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,390 
the applause transform the convolution a
two-time functions

57
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,640 
is the product love The Associated

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,240 
the floss transforms now

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,280 
its important at some point

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,450 
to think carefully about the region of
convergence

61
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,390 
as we discuss these properties and let
me just

62
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,440 
draw your attention to the fact dead in

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,030 
discussing properties fully and in
detail

64
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,430 
one has to pay attention not just to

65
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,310 
how the algebraic expression changes

66
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,850 
but also what the consequences are for
the region of convergence

67
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,889 
and thats discuss in somewhat more
detail in the text and I won't do that

68
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,449 
here

69
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,580 
now the convolution property

70
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,449 
leads to of course a very important and
useful

71
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,610 
mechanism for dealing with linear
time-invariant systems

72
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,500 
very much as the 48 transformed did in
particular

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,660 
the convolution property tells us that

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,120 
if we have a linear time-invariant
system

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,300 
the output in the time domain of course
is the convolution

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,409 
of the input and the impulse response

77
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:09,710 
in the applause transform domain the
a-plus transformer the output

78
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,419 
is the love plus transformer the impulse
response

79
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,770 
times the low-priced transformer the
input

80
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,909 
and again this of course is a
generalization

81
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,229 
love the corresponding property for 48
transports

82
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,469 
in the case I'll the 48 transform

83
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,930 
the Fourier transform the appalls
response we refer to as the frequency

84
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,439 
response

85
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,110 
in the more general case with applause
transforms

86
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,409 
it's typical to refer to the apostrophe
its former the impulse response

87
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,520 
as the system function

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,740 
now the

89
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,020 
in talking about the system function

90
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,419 
the issue some issues love the region of
convergence and for that matter location

91
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,680 
opposes the system function

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,539 
are closely tied in and related

93
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,949 
to issues of whether the system is
stable and causal

94
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,409 
and in fact there's some useful
statements that can be made

95
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,650 
that play an important role throughout
the further discussion

96
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,409 
for example we know from previous
discussions

97
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:22,080 
that the there's a condition for
stability of a system which is absolute

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,370 
integrability of the impulse response

99
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,389 
and that in fact is the same condition

100
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,229 
for convergence of the Fourier transform
of the impulse response

101
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,150 
what that says really is that

102
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,569 
if a system is stable then the region of
convergence

103
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,249 
of the system function must include the
che Omega axis which of course is where

104
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:52,400 
the applause transform reduces to the
Fourier transform

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,509 
so that relates the regional convergence
and stability

106
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,689 
also you recall from last time

107
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,039 
that we talked about the regional
convergence associated with

108
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,479 
right-sided time functions in particular
for right-sided time function the reach

109
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:08,779 
of convergence

110
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,319 
must be to the right the rightmost poll

111
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,099 
well if in fact we have a system that's
causal

112
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,860 
then the that causality

113
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,830 
imposes the condition that the impulse
response be right sided

114
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,710 
its own fact for causality we would have
a regional convergence

115
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,150 
associated with the system function
which is to the right to the right most

116
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,770 
poll

117
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,960 
now interestingly in very important is

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,240 
the consequence if you put those two
statements together

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,289 
in particular your lead to the
conclusion

120
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,800 
that for stable causal system

121
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,629 
all the polls must be in the left half

122
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,849 
up the ass play what's the reason

123
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,869 
the reason of course is that if the
system is stable in causal

124
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,520 
the regional convergence must be to the
right of the rightmost poll

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,460 
it must include DJ Omega axes obviously
then

126
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,650 
all the polls must be in the left after
the S

127
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,979 
and again that's an issue that is
discussed

128
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,629 
somewhat more carefully and in more
detail in the text

129
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,159 
now the properties that we're talking
about here

130
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,619 
are not the only properties there are
many others

131
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,009 
but these properties in particular
provide

132
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,479 
the mechanism as they did with Fourier
transforms

133
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,800 
for turning linear constant coefficient
differential equations into algebraic

134
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,169 
equations

135
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,060 
and correspondingly lead to a mechanism

136
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,089 
for dealing with solving when your
constant coefficient differential

137
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:48,910 
equations

138
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,240 
and I'd like to illustrate that by
looking

139
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,029 
at both first-order and second-order
differential equations

140
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,380 
let's begin first evolve with the
first-order

141
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,430 
differential equation and in so what
we're talking about

142
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,520 
is a first order system

143
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,970 
what I mean by that is a system that's

144
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,870 
characterize by a first-order
differential equation

145
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,510 
and if we apply to this equation the

146
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,720 
differentiation property then

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,830 
the derivative the prosperous for the
derivative

148
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,600 
is s times the apostrophe s former the
time function

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,570 
the linearity property allows us to
combine these two gether

150
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,650 
and so consequently applying the law
applies transformed to this equation

151
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,310 
leads us to this algebraic equation and
following that through

152
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,000 
leads us to the statement that the
a-plus trance for the output

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,670 
is one over est plus a times the
applause transformer the input

154
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,120 
we know from the convolution property
that in fact this full price transform

155
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,520 
is the system function

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,030 
times X evas and so one over est plus a
a

157
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,300 
is the system function or equivalently
the applause transform of the impulse

158
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,450 
response

159
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,290 
so we can determine the impulse response

160
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,790 
by taking the inverse Laplace transform

161
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,870 
all HFS given by one over est plus a

162
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,080 
well we can do that using the inspection
method which is one way that we have

163
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,320 
doing inverse Laplace transforms the
question is then what time

164
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,640 
function has a plus transform which is
one over est plus a

165
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,930 
the problem that we run into in fact is
that there are two answers to that

166
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,050 
one over est plus 80 is the applause
transform

167
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,500 
are an exponential for positive time

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,630 
but one over est plus a is also the
apostrophe s for

169
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,530 
Aug an exponential for negative time

170
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,370 
which one of these do we end up picking

171
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,580 
well recall that the difference between
the

172
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,940 
is was in their region of convergence
and in fact

173
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,430 
in this case this corresponded to a
region of convergence

174
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,760 
which was the real part a vast greater
than minus a

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,030 
in this case this was the corresponding
applause transform

176
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,120 
provided at the real party bass is

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,740 
less than mine is a so we have to decide

178
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,770 
which region of convergence that we pick

179
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,760 
and it's not the differential equation
that will tell us that

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,630 
its something else that has to give us
that information

181
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,000 
what could it be well what it might be
is the additional

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,220 
information that the system is either
stable or causal

183
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,000 
so for example if the system was causal
we would know that the regional

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800 
convergence is to the right of the poll

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,290 
and that would correspond and to this

186
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,670 
being the impulse response

187
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,250 
whereas with a negative

188
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,790 
I'm sorry with a positive if we knew

189
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,850 
that the system let's say was not causal

190
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,310 
then we would associate with that this
region convergence

191
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,620 
and we know that we would know then that
this is the impulse response

192
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,270 
so a very important point is that

193
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,310 
what we see is that the when your car is
the coefficient differential equation

194
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,790 
gives us the algebraic

195
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,430 
expression for the system function

196
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,110 
but does not tell us about the region of
convergence we get the region of

197
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,160 
convergence

198
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,900 
from some auxiliary information what is
that information

199
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,420 
well it might for example the knowledge
that

200
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,710 
the system is perhaps table

201
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,600 
which tells us that the regional
convergence includes the jail making

202
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,610 
axis

203
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,370 
or perhaps causal which tells us that
the region of convergence

204
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,640 
is to the right to the right most poll
so it's the auxiliary information

205
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,010 
specifies 4s the region of convergence

206
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,910 
very important point the differential
equation by itself is not completely

207
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,350 
specify

208
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,850 
the system it only essentially tells us
what the algebraic expression is for the

209
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,300 
system function

210
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,940 
alright that's a first order example
let's now look at

211
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,640 
a second-order system and the
differential equation that I picked

212
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,100 
in this case I've parameterized in a
certain way which will see will be

213
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,190 
useful

214
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,590 
in particular it's the second order
differential equation and I've chosen

215
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,600 
just for simplicity to not include

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,040 
a derivatives on the right hand side
although we could have

217
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,760 
in fact if we did that would insert
zeros into the system function

218
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,980 
as well as the polls inserted by the
left hand side

219
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,850 
we can determine the system function in
exactly the same way namely apply the

220
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,830 
applause transformed to this equation

221
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,110 
that would convert this differential
equation to

222
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,430 
an algebraic equation and now on we
solve

223
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,630 
this algebraic equation for why a bass

224
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,270 
in terms of x a badass it will come out
in the former why evas

225
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,860 
equal to H a vast times X a badass

226
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,280 
and H invest in that case we would get
simply by dividing out by this

227
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,450 
polynomial an ass and so the system
function and

228
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,130 
is the expression that I have here

229
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,100 
so this is the form for second-order
system

230
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,760 
where there are two pole since this is
the second order polynomial

231
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,040 
there are no zeros Associated

232
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,960 
in with the fact that I had no
derivative up the input on the right

233
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,110 
hand side of the equation

234
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,120 
well let's look at this example

235
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,200 
namely the second-order system a little
more detail

236
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,710 
and what we want to look at is the
location at the polls and some issues

237
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,730 
such as for example the frequency
response

238
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,410 
so here again I have the algebraic

239
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,750 
expression for the system function

240
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,630 
in and as i indicated this is the second
order polynomial

241
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,790 
which means that we can factor it into
two routes

242
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:27,280 
and so c1 and c2 represent the polls
have the system function

243
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,660 
and in particular in relation to the two
parameters

244
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,660 
say to and Omega Sapan if we look at

245
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,140 
what these routes are than what we get

246
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,660 
are the to expressions that I have below

247
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,610 
and notice incidently dead if data is

248
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,560 
less than 1 than what's under the square
root

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,060 
is negative and so this in fact
corresponds to an imaginary

250
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,430 
part an imaginary term for Zeta less
than 1

251
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,630 
and so the two routes then have

252
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,290 
a real part which is given by -8 Omega
Sapan

253
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,240 
and an imaginary part if I were to
rewrite this

254
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,980 
and then expressed in terms or Jr
skirted -1

255
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,680 
in looking below will have a real part

256
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,130 
which is -8 Omega Sapan an imaginary
part which is omega Sapan

257
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,460 
times this square root thats reseda

258
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,190 
less than 1 and for Zeta greater than
one

259
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,360 
the two routes of course will be real

260
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,279 
part so let's examine this for the case
where

261
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,710 
data is less than 1 and

262
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,600 
what that corresponds to then are to
polls in the complex

263
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040 
plane and they have

264
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,690 
a real part and an imaginary part

265
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,920 
and you can exploit this is somewhat
more detail on your own

266
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,110 
but essentially what happens is that as
you keep the parameter

267
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,329 
Omega stuff and fixed and very

268
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,919 
data these polls trace out

269
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199 
a circle and for example

270
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,319 
with say to equal to 0 the polls

271
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,049 
are on the jail may access at Omega
Sapan

272
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:23,689 
for as as say to

273
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,860 
because once as a day

274
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,270 
increases and gets closer to one

275
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,159 
these the polls converge toward the real
axis

276
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,309 
and any particular for

277
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,309 
say to greater than one what we end up
with

278
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,440 
are to polls on the real axis

279
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,090 
well actually the case that we want to
look at

280
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,470 
a little more carefully is when the
polls are complex

281
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,080 
and what this becomes is a second-order
system which has we'll see

282
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,670 
as the discussion goes on as an impulse
response which

283
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,940 
oscillates with time correspondingly a
frequency response

284
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,870 
that has a residence well let's examine

285
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,270 
the frequency response little more
carefully

286
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,390 
and 1 I'm assuming in the discussion is
that first of all

287
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,370 
the polls are in the left half plane
corresponding

288
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,660 
to they don't make this a ban being
positive

289
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,870 
and so this is minus that is negative
and furthermore I'm assuming that the

290
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,730 
polls are complex

291
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,590 
and in that case the algebraic
expression

292
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,650 
for the system function is omega cement
squared in the numerator and two poles

293
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,700 
in the denominator which a complex
conjugates

294
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,030 
now what we want to look at is

295
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,730 
the frequency response the system

296
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,650 
and that corresponds to looking at

297
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,820 
the 4e a transformer the impulse
response

298
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,820 
which is the a-plus transform on the
jail making access

299
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,559 
so we want to examine what HSC is as we
move

300
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,750 
along the jail make axes and notice that
to do that

301
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,870 
in this algebraic expression

302
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,140 
we want to set s equal to jail maker and
then

303
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,520 
evaluate for example we want to look at
the magnet to the frequency response

304
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,740 
evaluate the magnet to of the complex
number

305
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,260 
well there's a very convenient way of
doing that geometrically

306
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,450 
by recognizing dead in the complex plane

307
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,580 
this complex number minus back complex
number represents a vector

308
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,200 
and essentially to look at the magnitude
of this complex number

309
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,370 
corresponds to taking omega Steuben
squared and dividing it

310
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,720 
by the product all the links of these
factors

311
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,640 
so let's look for example at the vector
ass minus C-one

312
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,890 
where s is on the Chi Omega axis

313
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,090 
and doing that here is

314
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,680 
the vector C-one

315
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,620 
and here is the vector ass which is jail
make if we're looking let's say at this

316
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,180 
bad you frequency

317
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,190 
and this specter than is the vector

318
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,690 
which he is J Omega minus C-one

319
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,800 
so in fact it's the link that this
vector

320
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,340 
that we want to observed as we change

321
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,210 
Omega namely as we move along the Chi
Omega axis

322
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,670 
you want to take this specter and this
specter

323
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,720 
take the lights at those factors
multiply them together

324
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,300 
divide that it will make its offense
where'd and that will give us

325
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,450 
the frequency response that's little
heart

326
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,360 
to see at a frequency response will work
out just looking at one point although

327
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,450 
notice that as we move along the jail
make axes

328
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,050 
as we get closer to this poll this
vector in fact gets shorter

329
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,120 
at so we might expect that

330
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,120 
the frequency response as a moving along
the Chi Omega axis in the vicinity is

331
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,940 
that poll

332
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,410 
would start to pee well I think that all
of this

333
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,460 
is much better seen dynamically on the
computer display

334
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,840 
so let's go to the computer display and
what we look at

335
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,760 
is a second-order system the frequency
response a bit as we move

336
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,350 
along jail make acts

337
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,360 
so here we see the poll pair in the
complex plane

338
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,160 
and to generate the frequency response

339
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,690 
we want to look at the behavior of the
poll vectors as we move vertically

340
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,190 
along the chair make axis so we'll

341
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,860 
show the poll vectors and let's begin

342
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,050 
at Omega equal 0 so here we have the
poll vectors from the polls to the point

343
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:56,330 
Omega equal to 0 and as we move
vertically along the jail make axis will

344
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,679 
see how the those poll vectors

345
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,260 
change in length the magnitude of the
frequency response is the reciprocal

346
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,340 
the product are the lights are those
factors

347
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,040 
shown below is the frequency response

348
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,760 
where we've begun just that'll make
equal to 0

349
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,490 
and as we move vertically

350
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,010 
along the jail make axis and the poll
vector last change

351
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,300 
that will then influence what the
frequency response looks like we've

352
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,460 
started here too move a little bit

353
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,000 
away from Omega equal to 0 and

354
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,640 
notice that in the upper half plane the
poll vector has gotten shorter

355
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,770 
the poll vector for the pole in the
lower half plane has gotten longer

356
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,309 
and now as omega increases further

357
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,580 
that process will continue and in
particular

358
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,650 
the poll vector associated with the poll
in the upper half plane

359
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,380 
will be as short as in the vicinity

360
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,820 
are in a freak at a frequency in the
vicinity of that poll

361
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,640 
and so for that frequency than the
frequency response will P

362
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,490 
and we see that here

363
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,590 
from this point as the frequency
increases

364
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,710 
corresponding to moving further
vertically along the chair maker axes

365
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,260 
both poll vectors will increase in
laying

366
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,770 
and that means then dead the magnet to

367
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,440 
the frequency response will decrease for
this specific example

368
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,580 
the magnitude of the frequency response
will

369
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,920 
asymptotically go to zero

370
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,340 
so what we see here is there the
frequency response has a resonance

371
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,440 
and as we see geometrically from the way

372
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,400 
defectors behave their residence in
frequency

373
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,640 
is very clearly associated with the
position at the polls

374
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,350 
and so in fact illustrate that further
and

375
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,230 
dramatize it as long as we're focused on
it let's now

376
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,220 
look at the frequency response for the
second order example

377
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,850 
as we change the pole positions and
first what we'll do

378
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,330 
is let the polls move vertically

379
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,620 
parallel to the Chi Omega axes and see
how the frequency

380
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,120 
response changes and then we'll have the
polls move

381
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,960 
horizontally parallel to the relaxes and
see how the frequency response changes

382
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,780 
to display the behavior the frequency
response is the polls move we've

383
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,830 
change the vertical scale on

384
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,390 
the frequency response somewhat and

385
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,170 
now what we want to do is move the polls

386
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,049 
first parallel to the jail make axis and
then

387
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,780 
parallel to the real axis here we see
the

388
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,700 
effect moving the polls parallel to the
jail may axis

389
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,890 
and what we observe is that in fact the
frequency

390
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,170 
location the residence shifts basically
tracking

391
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,530 
the location at the pole

392
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,230 
if we now move the poll back

393
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,450 
down closer to the real axis then

394
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,750 
this residents will shift back toward
its original location

395
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:29,750 
and so let's now see that

396
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,059 
and here we are back at the frequency
that we started at

397
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:47,809 
now will move the polls even closer to
the real axis

398
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,470 
the frequency location at the residence

399
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,620 
will continue to shift toward lower
frequencies

400
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,900 
and also in the process incidently

401
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,809 
the height ove the resonant peak will
increase

402
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,890 
because of course the lengths love

403
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,080 
the poll factors are getting shorter

404
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,970 
and so we see now the residence shifting
down toward lower and lower frequency

405
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,460 
and finally what

406
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,440 
will now do is move the polls back to
their

407
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,270 
original position and the resonant peak
will

408
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,590 
of course shift back up and
correspondingly

409
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,880 
the height or amplitude the residence

410
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,880 
will decrease and now we're back at the
frequency response that

411
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,580 
we head generated previously next we'd
like to look at the behavior as the

412
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,260 
polls

413
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,070 
move parallel to the real axis first
closer to the J Omega axis and then

414
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,110 
further away

415
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,150 
as they move closer to the jail make
access

416
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,230 
the residence sharpens because of the
fact

417
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,550 
that the poll factor get shorter and
responds

418
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,070 
or changes in like more quickly as we
move past it

419
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,970 
moving along the jail make axis so

420
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,700 
here we see the effect a move in the
polls closer to the jail make axis

421
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,830 
the residence has gotten narrower in
frequency

422
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:29,390 
and higher in amplitude associated with
the fact that the poll vector get

423
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,070 
shorter

424
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,830 
next

425
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,190 
as we move back to the original location

426
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,679 
the residents will broaden once again
and the airport to

427
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,679 
will decrease

428
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,440 
and then if we continue to move the
polls even further away

429
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,480 
from the real axis the residents will
broaden

430
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,100 
even further and the ample to the peak
will

431
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:13,100 
become even smaller and finally

432
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,950 
let's now just move the polls back to

433
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,220 
their original position and we'll see

434
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:28,220 
the Reds residence narrow again and
become higher

435
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,129 
and so what we see then is that for

436
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:43,529 
a second-order system the behavior above
the residents basically is associated

437
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,169 
with the Polo cations the frequency the
residence associated with the vertical

438
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,429 
position in the polls

439
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,990 
and the sharpness at the residence

440
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,090 
Associated with the real party polls in
other words there

441
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,419 
position closer or further away from the

442
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,159 
J Omega axis okay so

443
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,470 
for complex polls then into the second
order

444
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,019 
system what we see is that we get

445
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:17,649 
a resident kind of behavior and

446
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:20,820 
in particular then that resident
behavior

447
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,249 
tens to peak or get pic year

448
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:28,139 
as the value of data gets smaller

449
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:31,679 
and here just to remind you what you saw

450
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,110 
here is the frequency response with

451
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,279 
one particular choices values well this
is normalized to make a span is one one

452
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,950 
particular choice for Zeta

453
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,070 
family .4 here is

454
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,049 
what we have with say to smaller

455
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,379 
and finally here is example

456
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:57,830 
where say that has gotten even smaller
than that and what that corresponds to

457
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,330 
is the polls moving closer to the jail
make axes

458
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,710 
the corresponding frequency response
getting PQ

459
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,149 
now in the

460
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,629 
time-domain what happens is that

461
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,769 
we have of course these complex roots

462
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:18,450 
which I indicated previously where

463
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,159 
this represents the imaginary part
because data is less than one

464
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,210 
and in the time domain we will have

465
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,460 
a form for the behavior which is a

466
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,299 
e2 the C-one TV plus a conjugate

467
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:36,019 
eat so the C-one conjugate

468
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:39,710 
see and so

469
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:46,080 
in fact as the polls get closer to the
jail make axis cars fine to use a to

470
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,059 
getting smaller

471
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,279 
as the polls get closer to

472
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,850 
the chair maker axis in the frequency
domain

473
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,259 
the residences get sharper in the time
domain

474
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,480 
the real part all the polls has gotten
smaller

475
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,179 
and that means in fact that in the time
domain

476
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:07,799 
behavior will be more oscillatory and
less than

477
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,759 
and so just looking at that again

478
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,129 
here is in the time domain

479
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:19,279 
what happens first IPL with

480
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,590 
and the parameter say to equal to

481
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,659 
.4 and isolates an exponentially

482
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,809 
dies out year

483
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,940 
is the second-order system

484
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,299 
where data is now point to is that a
point for

485
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:41,059 
and finally the second-order system

486
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:44,259 
wears a to is .1

487
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,210 
and what we see as say to get smaller
and smaller

488
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,509 
is dead the oscillations are basically
the same but

489
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,600 
the exponential damping becomes

490
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,220 
less and less right now

491
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,609 
this is a somewhat more detailed look at
second-order systems

492
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:08,899 
and second or two systems and for that
matter first order systems are

493
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:12,899 
systems that are important in their own
right but

494
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:17,570 
they also are important as basic
building blocks

495
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,340 
for more general in particular for
higher-order systems

496
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,519 
and the way in which that stone
typically

497
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,179 
is by combining first- and second-order
systems together

498
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,429 
in such a way that they implement
higher-order systems

499
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,600 
and two very common connections are

500
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,720 
connections which are cascade
connections

501
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,690 
and connections which are parallel
connections in a cascade connection

502
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,289 
we would think love combining this
system

503
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:52,059 
systems individual systems together as i
indicated herein series

504
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,809 
and of course from the convolution
property the overall system function

505
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,289 
is the product of the individual system
functions

506
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:04,330 
so for example if these were all

507
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,109 
second-order systems and I A combined
and have them together in cascade

508
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:13,649 
the overall system would be a system
that would have

509
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:18,190 
2n polls in other words it would be a 2n
order system

510
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,679 
that's one very common kind of
connection another

511
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,639 
very common kind of connection for
first- and second-order systems

512
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,250 
is a parallel connection where in that
case

513
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,000 
we connect the systems together as they
indicate here

514
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,389 
the overall system function is just
simply the sum of these and that follows

515
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:41,730 
from the linearity property

516
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,309 
and so the overall system function would
be as i indicate

517
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,889 
algebraically here and notice that

518
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:52,309 
if each of these are second-order
systems

519
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,759 
and I had capital and have them in
parallel

520
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,440 
when you think a putting the overall
system function over one common

521
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,639 
denominator

522
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,619 
that common denominator in general is
going to be

523
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,980 
all order to an so either

524
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,369 
the parallel connection or the Cascade
connection

525
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,349 
can be used to implement higher-order
systems

526
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,149 
one very common context in which
second-order systems

527
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:23,490 
are combined together either in parallel

528
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,869 
or in cascade to form a

529
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:30,710 
more interesting system is in fact

530
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,010 
in speech synthesis and what I'd like to
do is

531
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,470 
demonstrate a speech synthesizer which I
have here

532
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,540 
which in fact is a parallel

533
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,169 
combination 04 second-order

534
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:49,940 
systems very much are the type that
we've just talked about

535
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,960 
all returned to the synthesizer in a
minute let me

536
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,130 
first just indicate with the basic idea
is in speech synthesis

537
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,280 
of course what we're trying to represent
a reply man is something dead

538
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,530 
corresponds to the vocal tract

539
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,770 
the vocal tract is characterized by said
residences

540
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,069 
and we can think of representing you to
those residences by a second-order

541
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,170 
system

542
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,880 
and then the higher-order system
corresponding to the vocal tract

543
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,290 
is built by in this case a parallel
combination

544
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,690 
the second-order systems and so

545
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,140 
for the synthesizer what we have
connected together

546
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,250 
in parallel is 4

547
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,770 
second-order systems and

548
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,990 
a control on each one of them that
controls the center frequency

549
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,470 
or the resonant frequency love each oath

550
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,930 
the second-order systems

551
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,549 
the exhortation is an exhortation

552
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:56,260 
that would represent the airflow through
the vocal cords

553
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,760 
the vocal cords vibrate and their pop
severe

554
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,440 
through the vocal cords as they open and
close it so the exhortation

555
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,690 
for the synthesizer corresponds to

556
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,609 
a pulse train representing

557
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:16,380 
the airflow through the vocal cords the
fundamental frequency if this

558
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,710 
representing the fundamental frequency
love

559
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,779 
the synthesized voice so that's the
basic

560
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:27,839 
structure the synthesizer and what we
have in this

561
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,010 
analog synthesizer are separate controls

562
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,609 
on the individual center frequencies

563
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,200 
their is a control representing the
center frequency of the third resonator

564
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,579 
and the fourth resonator and those are
represented by these two knobs

565
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,869 
and then the first and second resonators

566
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:52,069 
are controlled by moving this joystick
the first resonator

567
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:56,290 
by moving the joystick along this axis

568
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:01,040 
and the second resonator by moving the
joystick along this axis

569
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,480 
and then in addition to controls on

570
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,859 
the for resonators we can control

571
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,810 
the fundamental frequency the
exhortation and we do that

572
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,930 
with this not so let's first of all just
listen

573
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,930 
to wanted the resonators and the
resonator that

574
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,099 
I'll play is the fourth resonator and

575
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,750 
what you'll hear first is the output as
a very

576
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,750 
the center frequency of that resonator
stonewalling

577
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,329 
share

578
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:40,800 
and then free she's acts

579
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,380 
and then as I A indicated I can also
control the fundamental frequency the

580
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,440 
exhortation

581
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,170 
by turning this knob Ste

582
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,970 
slowing the fundamentals she K

583
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,970 
he

584
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,880 
all right now if the four resonators in
parallel

585
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,860 
are and implementation love the vocal
cavity

586
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,770 
then presumably we can synthesize when
we put them all in

587
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,380 
are Val sounds and let's do that

588
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,680 
on now switch in the other resonators

589
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,770 
when we do that then

590
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,820 
depending on

591
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,540 
what choice we have to the individual
resonant frequencies

592
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,750 
we should be able to synthesize balanced
sound so here for example is the Val

593
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,380 
E Ste here's

594
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,140 
of

595
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,009 
act and

596
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:47,160 
course we can

597
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,280 
generate

598
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,390 
lots of other Val sounds

599
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:58,390 
and change the fundamental frequency
same time

600
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,670 
now if we want to synthesize speech

601
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,720 
it's not enough to just synthesized
steady-state Balzac its

602
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,970 
boring after a while course what happens
with

603
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,980 
the vocal cavity is that it moves as a
function of time

604
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,750 
and that's what generates the the

605
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,410 
speech that we want to generate and so

606
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,910 
presumably man if we change these

607
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,569 
resonant frequencies as a function of
time appropriately

608
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:33,750 
then we should be able to synthesize
speech and so by

609
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,240 
moving these residences around weekend
generate

610
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,029 
synthesized speech and can let's try it

611
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:44,519 
a with some phrases and I'll do that

612
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,740 
by simply adjusting the center
frequencies appropriately

613
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,390 
now

614
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:58,390 
well hopefully you

615
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,359 
understood that is you can imagine I
spend at least a few minutes before

616
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,769 
the lecture try to practice that's so
that it would come out

617
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:10,599 
to be more less intelligible now

618
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:13,980 
the system as i've just demonstrated is

619
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,809 
of course a continuous-time system or an
analyte speech synthesizer

620
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:22,279 
their are many versions of

621
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:26,640 
digital or discrete-time synthesizers
one of the first in fact

622
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,400 
being a device that many view

623
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,289 
are very likely familiar with which is
the Texas Instruments speak n spell

624
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:35,170 
which

625
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,220 
I show here and what's

626
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,960 
very interesting and rather dramatic
about this device

627
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,180 
is the fact that it implements the
speech synthesis in very much the same

628
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,470 
way as

629
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,400 
I've demonstrated with the analog
synthesizer

630
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,400 
in this case it's five second-order
filters

631
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,319 
in a configuration that slightly
different than a parallel configuration

632
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,119 
but conceptually

633
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,650 
very closely related and let's take a
look

634
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,599 
inside the box and what we see their

635
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,109 
with a slide that was kindly supplied by
Texas Instruments

636
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:15,299 
is the fact that there really are only
four chips in the air

637
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:20,160 
a controller chips and storage and the
important point is the chip that's

638
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,799 
labeled

639
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:24,109 
as the speech synthesis chip in fact

640
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:27,890 
is what embodies our implements the five

641
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,319 
second order filters and in addition

642
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,599 
incorporate some other things a memory
and also the

643
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,109 
D-day converters so in fact the

644
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:43,259 
implementation and the synthesizer is
pretty much done on a single chip

645
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:47,190 
well that's a discrete-time

646
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,230 
system we've been talking for the last

647
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,769 
several lectures about continuous-time
systems and no fuss transform

648
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,730 
hopefully what you've seen in this
lecture in the previous lecture

649
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,900 
is the powerful tool

650
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,079 
dead the a poss transform affords us

651
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119 
in analyzing and understanding

652
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,650 
system behavior in the next lecture

653
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,309 
what I'd like to do is parallel the
discussion

654
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:22,549 
for discrete-time turn our attention to
busy transform

655
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:27,309 
and as you can imagine simply by virtue
of the fact that

656
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:30,890 
we I've kinda shown you a digital and
analog

657
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,940 
version a very much the same kind of
system the discussions

658
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,960 
how all themselves very strongly and
dizzy transform

659
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,470 
will play very much the same role in
discrete-time that

660
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,349 
the apostrophe is formed dozen continues
thank you
